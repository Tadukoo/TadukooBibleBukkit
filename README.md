Tadukoo Bible Project
=====================

Story
-----
The story of the Tadukoo Bible Project started on July 19, 2013. I (Tadukoo) have been a Christian, and I realized I couldn't think of any Bukkit plugins
that were Christian related. I did some research, and the closest thing was SimpleJesus, which was outdated at the time (it might still be), and it
basically just made it so you could throw a snowball that would turn into a burning cow and heal yourself and others. I then realized I couldn't
think of any Minecraft mods that were Christian related either. I looked for some, and only found one, and it wasn't complete, plus it was a bit
outdated as well. It was the Moses Mod, which added Moses' staff (which could only be gained through the creative inventory or through use of
commands). If you use this staff on the water, it would part, like how Moses parted the Red Sea. The fact that there were so little Christian mods
and plugins upset me, so I decided to add to the mix. I decided that I would start a plugin that would allow players to read the Bible through
commands on a server.

A few days into coding this plugin, I found an outdated Bukkit plugin where it would show a daily Bible verse on the server, which came from
Bible Gateway. It only allowed for one translation (I think it was NIV).

Goal
----
The goal of the Tadukoo Bible Project is to spread the Gospel through Minecraft, in the hopes that more people will read God's word and come to Him 
through a video game. Hopefully in the future, there will be new plugins and/or mods that will help as well, but this is only the beginning.

Download
--------
This plugin is available [on BukkitDev] (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tadukoo-bible/).

Alternately, you could download the classes, config.yml, and plugin.yml file, then import them into eclipse (or your choice of IDE),
along with importing the Bukkit API (Currently this plugin is built off of [1.7.9-R0.2 Beta Build 1938] 
(http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/bukkit/view/02630_1.7.9-R0.2/)). Do not import the Tadukoo_Bible folder into eclipse. Simply place it in your plugins 
folder.
