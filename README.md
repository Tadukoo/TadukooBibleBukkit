Tadukoo Bible Project
=====================

Story
-----
The story of the Tadukoo Bible Project started on July 19, 2013. Tadukoo has been a Christian, and he realized he couldn't think of any Bukkit plugins
that were Christian related. He did some research, and the closest thing was SimpleJesus, which was outdated at the time (it might still be), and it
basically just made it so you could throw a snowball that would turn into a burning cow and heal yourself and others. He then realized he couldn't
think of any Minecraft mods that were Christian related either. He looked for some, and only found one, and it wasn't complete, plus it was a bit
outdated as well. It was the Moses Mod, which added Moses' staff (which could only be gained through the creative inventory or through use of
commands). If you use this staff on the water, it would part, like how Moses parted the Red Sea. The fact that there were so little Christian mods
and plugins upset Tadukoo, so he decided to add to the mix. He decided that he would start a plugin that would allow players to read the Bible through
commands on a server.

Goal
----
The goal of the Tadukoo Bible Project is to spread the Gospel through a Minecraft plugin, in the hopes that more people will read God's word through
a video game. Hopefully in the future, there will be new plugins and/or mods that will help as well, but this is only the beginning.
