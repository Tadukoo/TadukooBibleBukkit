Tadukoo Bible Project
=====================

Story
-----
The story of the Tadukoo Bible Project started on July 19, 2013. I (Tadukoo) have been a Christian, and I realized I couldn't think of any Bukkit plugins
that were Christian related. I did some research, and the closest thing was SimpleJesus, which was outdated at the time (it might still be), and it
basically just made it so you could throw a snowball that would turn into a burning cow and heal yourself and others. I then realized I couldn't
think of any Minecraft mods that were Christian related either. I looked for some, and only found one, and it wasn't complete, plus it was a bit
outdated as well. It was the Moses Mod, which added Moses' staff (which could only be gained through the creative inventory or through use of
commands). If you use this staff on the water, it would part, like how Moses parted the Red Sea. The fact that there were so little Christian mods
and plugins upset me, so I decided to add to the mix. I decided that I would start a plugin that would allow players to read the Bible through
commands on a server.

A few days into coding this plugin, I found an outdated Bukkit plugin where it would show a daily Bible verse on the server, which came from
Bible Gateway. It only allowed for one translation (I think it was NIV).

Goal
----
The goal of the Tadukoo Bible Project is to spread the Gospel through Minecraft, in the hopes that more people will read God's word and come to Him 
through a video game. Hopefully in the future, there will be new plugins and/or mods that will help as well, but this is only the beginning.

commands and features.

Known Issues
------------
None at the moment.

Translations
------------
Currently the only translation in the plugin is the King James Version (KJV), which is public domain. In the future, I will be requesting permission
for other translations.

Download
--------
This plugin is now in Beta, so it is [on BukkitDev] (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tadukoo-bible/).

Alternately, you could download the classes, config.yml, and plugin.yml file, then import them into eclipse (or your choice of IDE),
along with importing the Bukkit API (Currently this plugin is built off of [1.7.9-R0.2 Beta Build 1938] 
(http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/bukkit/view/02630_1.7.9-R0.2/)). Do not import the Tadukoo_Bible folder into eclipse. Simply place it in your plugins 
folder.

Version System
--------------
* Alpha
   * Alpha is the original version through the time the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy), 
   the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and the 3 Johns (1, 2, and 3 John) are completed.
   * During this time, the plugin will be "private". That means that only I will have the jar file myself, but it is still open source,
   so other people could technically make the jar themselves if they wanted to and knew how.
* Beta
   * Beta will be from the time Alpha is completed (which will be Beta 0.2), until the time that the official release comes.
   * During this time, the plugin's jar will be available on BukkitDev for anyone to download if they want it.
   * Also during this time, I will only update the plugin (on the BukkitDev page at least) when either 10% more is completed or a new feature
   is added or a bug is fixed.
* Official Release
   * The "official release" will be once the entire Bible is complete in the KJV translation. This will be v.1.0.
* Decimals
   * Currently the entire system is based off of just the King James Version progress.
   * Each book of the Bible is either considered 2% (or a part of 2%) of the entirety.
      * Each 2% is + 0.0.2 to the version number. (so Genesis being completed would be Alpha 0.0.2, Exodus would be Alpha 0.0.4, etc.)
      * The books which are not two percent by themselves are:
         * Judges and Ruth = 2%
         * Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther = 2%
         * Psalms is divided into five sections:
            * Psalms 1-30 = 2%
            * Psalms 31-60 = 2%
            * Psalms 61-90 = 2%
            * Psalms 91-120 = 2%
            * Psalms 121-150 = 2%
         * Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs = 2%
         * Jeremiah and Lamentations = 2%
         * Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi = 2%
         * Titus and Philemon = 2%
         * 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John = 2%
         * Jude and Revelation = 2%
* After Official Release v.1.0
   * After the Official Release, each version will get .01 added for small updates (i.e. v.1.0), 0.1 for big updates (i.e. v.1.1), 
   and 1 for major updates (i.e. v.2.0)
   * Any new translations will probably only be added once they're completed or added in halves, fourths, fifths, or tenths.
