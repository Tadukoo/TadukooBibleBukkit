    forasmuch as he defiled his father''s bed, his birthright was given unto the sons
    of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the'
  '19': birthright. &l2&rFor Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:) &l3&rThe sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were, Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. &l4&rThe sons of Joel; Shemaiah

    Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon: &l9&rAnd eastward he inhabited unto the entering
    in of the'
  '22': 'wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied
    in the land of Gilead. &l10&rAnd in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites,
    who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east
    land of Gilead.'
  '23': '&l11&rAnd the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan
    unto Salcah: &l12&rJoel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat
    in Bashan. &l13&rAnd their brethren of the house of their fathers were, Michael,
    and Meshullam,'

  '25': Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their fathers. &l16&rAnd they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders. &l17&rAll these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of
  '26': Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel. &l18&rThe sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty thousand seven
  '27': 'hundred and threescore, that went out to the war. &l19&rAnd they made war
    with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab. &l20&rAnd they were helped
    against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were
    with them: for'
  '28': they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him. &l21&rAnd they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an
  '29': 'hundred thousand. &l22&rFor there fell down many slain, because the war was
    of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity. &l23&rAnd the children
    of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto
    Baalhermon and'
  '30': Senir, and unto mount Hermon. &l24&rAnd these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and heads of the house of their fathers.
  '31': '&l25&rAnd they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a
    whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.
    &l26&rAnd the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and
    the spirit of'
  '32': Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.

  '21': uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. &l5&rAnd when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died. &l6&rSo Saul died, and his
  '22': 'three sons, and all his house died together. &l7&rAnd when all the men of
    Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons
    were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came
    and dwelt in them.'
  '23': '&l8&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip
    the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa. &l9&rAnd
    when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into
    the land of the'
  '24': Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people. &l10&rAnd they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. &l11&rAnd when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done
  '25': to Saul, &l12&rThey arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. &l13&rSo Saul died for his transgression which he
  '26': 'committed against the Lord, even against the word of the Lord, which he kept
    not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire
    of it; &l14&rAnd enquired not of the Lord: therefore he slew him, and turned the
    kingdom unto David'
  '27': the son of Jesse.
  '28': 'Chapter 11

    Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are
    thy bone and thy flesh. &l2&rAnd moreover in time past, even when Saul was king,
    thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord thy God said'
  '29': unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel. &l3&rTherefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord; and they anointed David king over
  '30': Israel, according to the word of the Lord by Samuel. &l4&rAnd David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land. &l5&rAnd the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither.
  '31': Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David. &l6&rAnd David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief. &l7&rAnd David dwelt in the castle;
  '32': 'therefore they called it the city of David. &l8&rAnd he built the city round
    about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city. &l9&rSo
    David waxed greater and greater: for the Lord of hosts was with him. &l10&rThese
    also are the'
  '33': chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel. &l11&rAnd this is the number of the mighty men whom David had;
  '34': 'Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear
    against three hundred slain by him at one time. &l12&rAnd after him was Eleazar
    the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties. &l13&rHe was
    with David at'
  '35': Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. &l14&rAnd they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the
  '36': Philistines; and the Lord saved them by a great deliverance. &l15&rNow three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim. &l16&rAnd David was then in the
  '37': hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem. &l17&rAnd David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate! &l18&rAnd the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew
  '38': 'water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and
    brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the
    Lord. &l19&rAnd said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall
    I drink the blood of'
  '39': 'these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of
    their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did
    these three mightiest. &l20&rAnd Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of
    the three: for lifting up'
  '40': 'his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.
    &l21&rOf the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain:
    howbeit he attained not to the first three. &l22&rBenaiah the son of Jehoiada,
    the son of a'
  '41': 'valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men
    of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day. &l23&rAnd
    he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian''s
    hand was a spear'
  '42': like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. &l24&rThese things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties. &l25&rBehold, he
  '43': 'was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and
    David set him over his guard. &l26&rAlso the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel
    the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, &l27&rShammoth the
    Harorite, Helez the'

    the greatest over a thousand. &l15&rThese are they that went over Jordan in the
    first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them
    of the valleys,'
  '7': both toward the east, and toward the west. &l16&rAnd there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David. &l17&rAnd David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart
  '8': 'shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing
    there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke
    it. &l18&rThen the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and
    he said, Thine'
  '9': 'are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee,
    and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them,
    and made them captains of the band. &l19&rAnd there fell some of Manasseh to David,
    when he'
  '10': 'came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not:
    for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will

  '11': 'of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and

    they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men
    of valour, and were'
  '12': captains in the host. &l22&rFor at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God. &l23&rAnd these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn
  '13': the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the Lord. &l24&rThe children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war. &l25&rOf the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven
  '14': thousand and one hundred. &l26&rOf the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred. &l27&rAnd Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred; &l28&rAnd Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his

  '17': that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment. &l33&rOf Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty

    with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the
    rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king. &l39&rAnd there they
    were with David three'
  '21': 'days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them. &l40&rMoreover
    they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought
    bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes
    of figs, and'
  '22': 'bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for
    there was joy in Israel.'
  '23': 'Chapter 13

    And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every
    leader. &l2&rAnd David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good
    unto you, and that it be of the Lord our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren'
  '24': 'every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also
    to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may
    gather themselves unto us: &l3&rAnd let us bring again the ark of our God to us:
    for we enquired not at'
  '25': 'it in the days of Saul. &l4&rAnd all the congregation said that they would
    do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. &l5&rSo David gathered
    all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to
    bring the ark of'
  '26': God from Kirjathjearim. &l6&rAnd David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the Lord, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it. &l7&rAnd they
  '27': 'carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza
    and Ahio drave the cart. &l8&rAnd David and all Israel played before God with
    all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with
    timbrels, and with'
  '28': cymbals, and with trumpets. &l9&rAnd when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. &l10&rAnd the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to
  '29': 'the ark: and there he died before God. &l11&rAnd David was displeased, because
    the Lord had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza
    to this day. &l12&rAnd David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring
    the ark of God'
  '30': home to me? &l13&rSo David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. &l14&rAnd the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the Lord blessed
  '31': the house of Obededom, and all that he had.
  '32': 'Chapter 14

    Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons
    and carpenters, to build him an house. &l2&rAnd David perceived that the Lord
    had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because'
  '33': 'of his people Israel. &l3&rAnd David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David
    begat more sons and daughters. &l4&rNow these are the names of his children which
    he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, &l5&rAnd Ibhar,
    and Elishua, and'
  '34': Elpalet, &l6&rAnd Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, &l7&rAnd Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. &l8&rAnd when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went
  '35': out against them. &l9&rAnd the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. &l10&rAnd David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord said unto him, Go up;
  '36': 'for I will deliver them into thine hand. &l11&rSo they came up to Baalperazim;
    and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies
    by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name
    of that place'
  '37': Baalperazim. &l12&rAnd when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. &l13&rAnd the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. &l14&rTherefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto
  '38': 'him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against
    the mulberry trees. &l15&rAnd it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going
    in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for
    God is gone forth'
  '39': 'before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. &l16&rDavid therefore did
    as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even
    to Gazer. &l17&rAnd the fame of David went out into all lands; and the Lord brought
    the fear of'
  '40': him upon all nations.
  '41': 'Chapter 15

    And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark
    of God, and pitched for it a tent. &l2&rThen David said, None ought to carry the
    ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of
    God,'
  '42': 'and to minister unto him for ever. &l3&rAnd David gathered all Israel together
    to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord unto his place, which he had prepared
    for it. &l4&rAnd David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: &l5&rOf
    the sons of'
  '43': 'Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: &l6&rOf
    the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:
    &l7&rOf the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty:
    &l8&rOf the sons of'
  '44': 'Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: &l9&rOf the
    sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: &l10&rOf the sons
    of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve. &l11&rAnd
    David called for Zadok'
  '45': 'and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel,
    Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, &l12&rAnd said unto them, Ye are the chief
    of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren,
    that ye may bring up'
  '46': the ark of the Lord God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it. &l13&rFor because ye did it not at the first, the Lord our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. &l14&rSo the priests and the Levites
  '47': sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel. &l15&rAnd the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the Lord. &l16&rAnd David spake to the
  '48': chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. &l17&rSo the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the
  '49': son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; &l18&rAnd with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and
  '50': Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters. &l19&rSo the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;

    went to bring'

  '5': 'with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the
    singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had

    of the Lord with'
  '6': shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. &l29&rAnd it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking
  '7': 'out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in
    her heart.'
  '8': 'Chapter 16

    So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David
    had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before
    God. &l2&rAnd when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the'
  '9': peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord. &l3&rAnd he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. &l4&rAnd he appointed certain of the Levites to
  '10': 'minister before the ark of the Lord, and to record, and to thank and praise
    the Lord God of Israel: &l5&rAsaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel,
    and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom:
    and Jeiel with'
  '11': psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; &l6&rBenaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. &l7&rThen on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the Lord into the
  '12': 'hand of Asaph and his brethren. &l8&rGive thanks unto the Lord, call upon
    his name, make known his deeds among the people. &l9&rSing unto him, sing psalms
    unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works. &l10&rGlory ye in his holy name:
    let the heart of them'

  '15': unto Isaac; &l17&rAnd hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, &l18&rSaying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; &l19&rWhen ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

    unto the Lord, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength.
    &l29&rGive'
  '19': 'unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before
    him: worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. &l30&rFear before him, all the

    &l32&rLet the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all
    that is therein. &l33&rThen shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence
    of the Lord,'
  '21': because he cometh to judge the earth. &l34&rO give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. &l35&rAnd say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to
  '22': thy holy name, and glory in thy praise. &l36&rBlessed be the Lord God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the Lord. &l37&rSo he left there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord Asaph and his brethren, to minister
  '23': 'before the ark continually, as every day''s work required: &l38&rAnd Obededom
    with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and
    Hosah to be porters: &l39&rAnd Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests,
    before the'
  '24': tabernacle of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon, &l40&rTo offer burnt offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord, which he
  '25': commanded Israel; &l41&rAnd with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the Lord, because his mercy endureth for ever; &l42&rAnd with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those
  '26': 'that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons
    of Jeduthun were porters. &l43&rAnd all the people departed every man to his house:
    and David returned to bless his house.'
  '27': 'Chapter 17

    Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the
    prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the
    Lord remaineth under curtains. &l2&rThen Nathan said unto David, Do all that is
    in thine'
  '28': 'heart; for God is with thee. &l3&rAnd it came to pass the same night, that
    the word of God came to Nathan, saying, &l4&rGo and tell David my servant, Thus
    saith the Lord, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: &l5&rFor I have
    not dwelt in an house'
  '29': since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another. &l6&rWheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people,
  '30': saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? &l7&rNow therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people
  '31': 'Israel: &l8&rAnd I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and
    have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like
    the name of the great men that are in the earth. &l9&rAlso I will ordain a place
    for my people'
  '32': Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, &l10&rAnd since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel.
  '33': Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the Lord will build thee an house. &l11&rAnd it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which
  '34': 'shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. &l12&rHe shall build
    me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever. &l13&rI will be his father,
    and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took
    it from him that'
  '35': 'was before thee: &l14&rBut I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom
    for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. &l15&rAccording to
    all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
    &l16&rAnd David'
  '36': the king came and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? &l17&rAnd yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while
  '37': to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Lord God. &l18&rWhat can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. &l19&rO Lord, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own
  '38': heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things. &l20&rO Lord, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. &l21&rAnd what one nation in the earth is like
  '39': thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? &l22&rFor thy people Israel didst thou make thine own
  '40': people for ever; and thou, Lord, becamest their God. &l23&rTherefore now, Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. &l24&rLet it even be established, that
  '41': 'thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The Lord of hosts is the God
    of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established
    before thee. &l25&rFor thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build
    him an house:'
  '42': 'therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee. &l26&rAnd
    now, Lord, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: &l27&rNow
    therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be
    before thee for'
  '43': 'ever: for thou blessest, O Lord, and it shall be blessed for ever.'
  '44': 'Chapter 18

    Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued
    them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. &l2&rAnd
    he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David''s servants, and brought gifts. &l3&rAnd'
  '45': 'David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his
    dominion by the river Euphrates. &l4&rAnd David took from him a thousand chariots,
    and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all
    the chariot'
  '46': horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots. &l5&rAnd when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. &l6&rThen David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became
  '47': David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went. &l7&rAnd David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. &l8&rLikewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of
  '48': Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. &l9&rNow when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; &l10&rHe sent Hadoram his son
  '49': to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. &l11&rThem also king David
  '50': dedicated unto the Lord, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

    &l12&rMoreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of
    salt eighteen thousand. &l13&rAnd he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites
    became David''s servants. Thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.'
  '2': '&l14&rSo David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice
    among all his people. &l15&rAnd Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and
    Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder. &l16&rAnd Zadok the son of Ahitub, and
    Abimelech the son of'

  '4': 'Chapter 19

    Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
    died, and his son reigned in his stead. &l2&rAnd David said, I will shew kindness
    unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David'
  '5': sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. &l3&rBut the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy
  '6': father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? &l4&rWherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their
  '7': 'buttocks, and sent them away. &l5&rThen there went certain, and told David
    how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed.
    And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
    &l6&rAnd when'
  '8': the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah. &l7&rSo they hired
  '9': thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. &l8&rAnd when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and
  '10': 'all the host of the mighty men. &l9&rAnd the children of Ammon came out,
    and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were
    come were by themselves in the field. &l10&rNow when Joab saw that the battle
    was set against him'
  '11': before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. &l11&rAnd the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
  '12': '&l12&rAnd he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help
    me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
    &l13&rBe of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people,
    and for the cities'
  '13': 'of our God: and let the Lord do that which is good in his sight. &l14&rSo
    Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle;
    and they fled before him. &l15&rAnd when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians
    were fled,'
  '14': they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. &l16&rAnd when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the
  '15': 'river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
    &l17&rAnd it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan,
    and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had
    put the battle in'
  '16': array against the Syrians, they fought with him. &l18&rBut the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. &l19&rAnd when
  '17': 'the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel,
    they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians
    help the children of Ammon any more.'
  '18': 'Chapter 20

    And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go
    out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of
    the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem.'
  '19': 'And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it. &l2&rAnd David took the crown of
    their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there
    were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David''s head: and he brought
    also exceeding much spoil'
  '20': out of the city. &l3&rAnd he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
  '21': '&l4&rAnd it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the
    Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the
    children of the giant: and they were subdued. &l5&rAnd there was war again with
    the Philistines;'
  '22': and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam. &l6&rAnd yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each
  '23': hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant. &l7&rBut when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him. &l8&rThese were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his
  '24': servants.
  '25': 'Chapter 21

    And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. &l2&rAnd
    David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba
    even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it. &l3&rAnd'
  '26': 'Joab answered, The Lord make his people an hundred times so many more as
    they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord''s servants? why then
    doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
    &l4&rNevertheless the'
  '27': king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. &l5&rAnd Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand
  '28': 'men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand
    men that drew sword. &l6&rBut Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for
    the king''s word was abominable to Joab. &l7&rAnd God was displeased with this
    thing; therefore he'
  '29': 'smote Israel. &l8&rAnd David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because
    I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant;
    for I have done very foolishly. &l9&rAnd the Lord spake unto Gad, David''s seer,
    saying,'
  '30': '&l10&rGo and tell David, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three
    things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. &l11&rSo Gad came
    to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Choose thee &l12&rEither three
    years'' famine; or three'
  '31': months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the Lord, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now
  '32': 'therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
    &l13&rAnd David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the
    hand of the Lord; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the
    hand of man. &l14&rSo'
  '33': 'the Lord sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand
    men. &l15&rAnd God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying,
    the Lord beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed,'
  '34': It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. &l16&rAnd David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand
  '35': stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. &l17&rAnd David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil
  '36': indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O Lord my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued. &l18&rThen the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David, that
  '37': David should go up, and set up an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. &l19&rAnd David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the Lord. &l20&rAnd Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with
  '38': him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. &l21&rAnd as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. &l22&rThen David said to Ornan, Grant me the place
  '39': 'of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the Lord:
    thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from
    the people. &l23&rAnd Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord
    the king do that which is'
  '40': 'good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and
    the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give
    it all. &l24&rAnd king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for
    the full price: for I'
  '41': will not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor offer burnt offerings without cost. &l25&rSo David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. &l26&rAnd David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and
  '42': peace offerings, and called upon the Lord; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering. &l27&rAnd the Lord commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof. &l28&rAt that time when David saw that the
  '43': Lord had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. &l29&rFor the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.
  '44': '&l30&rBut David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid
    because of the sword of the angel of the Lord.'
  '45': 'Chapter 22

    Then David said, This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar of the
    burnt offering for Israel. &l2&rAnd David commanded to gather together the strangers
    that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to'
  '46': 'build the house of God. &l3&rAnd David prepared iron in abundance for the
    nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance
    without weight; &l4&rAlso cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they
    of Tyre brought much'
  '47': 'cedar wood to David. &l5&rAnd David said, Solomon my son is young and tender,
    and the house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnifical,
    of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation
    for it. So'
  '48': David prepared abundantly before his death. &l6&rThen he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the Lord God of Israel. &l7&rAnd David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the
  '49': 'Lord my God: &l8&rBut the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou hast
    shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house
    unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. &l9&rBehold,
    a son shall be'
  '50': 'born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all
    his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace
    and quietness unto Israel in his days.'

    So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
    &l2&rAnd he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and
    the Levites. &l3&rNow the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and'
  '10': 'upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight
    thousand. &l4&rOf which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work
    of the house of the Lord; and six thousand were officers and judges: &l5&rMoreover
    four thousand were'
  '11': porters; and four thousand praised the Lord with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith. &l6&rAnd David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. &l7&rOf the Gershonites were, Laadan, and
  '12': Shimei. &l8&rThe sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. &l9&rThe sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan. &l10&rAnd the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush,
  '13': 'and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. &l11&rAnd Jahath was the
    chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore
    they were in one reckoning, according to their father''s house. &l12&rThe sons
    of Kohath; Amram, Izhar,'
  '14': 'Hebron, and Uzziel, four. &l13&rThe sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron
    was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for
    ever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister unto him, and to bless in his
    name for ever.'
  '15': '&l14&rNow concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe
    of Levi. &l15&rThe sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer. &l16&rOf the sons
    of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief. &l17&rAnd the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah
    the chief. And'
  '16': Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. &l18&rOf the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief. &l19&rOf the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. &l20&rOf the sons of
  '17': 'Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second. &l21&rThe sons of Merari;
    Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish. &l22&rAnd Eleazar died,
    and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.
    &l23&rThe sons of Mushi;'
  '18': Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. &l24&rThese were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord,
  '19': 'from the age of twenty years and upward. &l25&rFor David said, The Lord God
    of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for
    ever: &l26&rAnd also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle,
    nor any vessels of'
  '20': 'it for the service thereof. &l27&rFor by the last words of David the Levites
    were numbered from twenty years old and above: &l28&rBecause their office was

    is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.
    &l12&rBoth riches and'
  '15': honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. &l13&rNow therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. &l14&rBut who am I, and
  '16': 'what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this
    sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. &l15&rFor
    we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days
    on the earth are as'
  '17': a shadow, and there is none abiding. &l16&rO Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own. &l17&rI know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure
  '18': 'in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly
    offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present
    here, to offer willingly unto thee. &l18&rO Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of
    Israel, our'
  '19': 'fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart
    of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee: &l19&rAnd give unto Solomon
    my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes,
    and to do all'
  '20': these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision. &l20&rAnd David said to all the congregation, Now bless the Lord your God. And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and
  '21': worshipped the Lord, and the king. &l21&rAnd they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings unto the Lord, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and
  '22': 'sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: &l22&rAnd did eat and drink before
    the Lord on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David
    king the second time, and anointed him unto the Lord to be the chief governor,
    and Zadok to be'
  '23': priest. &l23&rThen Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. &l24&rAnd all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto
  '24': Solomon the king. &l25&rAnd the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. &l26&rThus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. &l27&rAnd
  '25': 'the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned
    he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. &l28&rAnd he
    died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son
    reigned in his stead.'
  '26': '&l29&rNow the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written
    in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in
    the book of Gad the seer, &l30&rWith all his reign and his might, and the times
    that went over him,'
  '27': and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
