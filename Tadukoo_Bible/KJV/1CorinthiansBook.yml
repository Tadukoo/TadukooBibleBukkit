  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes
    our brother, &l2&rUnto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are
    sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place
    call'
  '2': 'upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their''s and our''s: &l3&rGrace
    be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. &l4&rI
    thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by
    Jesus Christ;'
  '3': '&l5&rThat in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in
    all knowledge; &l6&rEven as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: &l7&rSo
    that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
    &l8&rWho shall also'
  '4': confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. &l9&rGod is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. &l10&rNow I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
  '5': Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. &l11&rFor it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the
  '6': house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. &l12&rNow this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. &l13&rIs Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name
  '7': 'of Paul? &l14&rI thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
    &l15&rLest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. &l16&rAnd I baptized
    also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
    &l17&rFor'
  '8': 'Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of
    words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. &l18&rFor the preaching
    of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it
    is the power'
  '9': of God. &l19&rFor it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. &l20&rWhere is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of
  '10': 'this world? &l21&rFor after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom
    knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
    believe. &l22&rFor the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
    &l23&rBut we preach'
  '11': Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; &l24&rBut unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. &l25&rBecause the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
  '12': 'weakness of God is stronger than men. &l26&rFor ye see your calling, brethren,
    how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are
    called: &l27&rBut God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound
    the wise; and God'
  '13': 'hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are
    mighty; &l28&rAnd base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath
    God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:
    &l29&rThat no flesh'
  '14': 'should glory in his presence. &l30&rBut of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who
    of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
    &l31&rThat, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the
    Lord.'
  '15': 'Chapter 2

    And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of
    wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. &l2&rFor I determined not to
    know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. &l3&rAnd I was
    with you in'
  '16': 'weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. &l4&rAnd my speech and my preaching
    was not with enticing words of man''s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit
    and of power: &l5&rThat your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but
    in the power of'
  '17': 'God. &l6&rHowbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the
    wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: &l7&rBut
    we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained
    before the'
  '18': 'world unto our glory: &l8&rWhich none of the princes of this world knew:
    for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. &l9&rBut
    as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
    the heart of man, the'
  '19': 'things which God hath prepared for them that love him. &l10&rBut God hath
    revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea,
    the deep things of God. &l11&rFor what man knoweth the things of a man, save the
    spirit of man which is'
  '20': in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. &l12&rNow we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. &l13&rWhich things also we
  '21': 'speak, not in the words which man''s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy
    Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. &l14&rBut the natural
    man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto
    him: neither can he'
  '22': know them, because they are spiritually discerned. &l15&rBut he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. &l16&rFor who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? but we have the mind of Christ.
  '23': 'Chapter 3

    And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal,
    even as unto babes in Christ. &l2&rI have fed you with milk, and not with meat:
    for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. &l3&rFor
    ye'
  '24': 'are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions,
    are ye not carnal, and walk as men? &l4&rFor while one saith, I am of Paul; and
    another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal? &l5&rWho then is Paul, and who is
    Apollos, but'
  '25': ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? &l6&rI have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. &l7&rSo then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. &l8&rNow he
  '26': 'that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his
    own reward according to his own labour. &l9&rFor we are labourers together with
    God: ye are God''s husbandry, ye are God''s building. &l10&rAccording to the grace
    of God which is'
  '27': given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. &l11&rFor other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. &l12&rNow if any
  '28': 'man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay,
    stubble; &l13&rEvery man''s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare
    it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man''s
    work of what sort it is.'
  '29': ' &l14&rIf any man''s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive
    a reward. &l15&rIf any man''s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but
    he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. &l16&rKnow ye not that ye are the
    temple of God, and'
  '30': that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? &l17&rIf any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. &l18&rLet no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him
  '31': become a fool, that he may be wise. &l19&rFor the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. &l20&rAnd again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. &l21&rTherefore
  '32': let no man glory in men. For all things are your's; &l22&rWhether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's; &l23&rAnd ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
  '33': 'Chapter 4

    Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the
    mysteries of God. &l2&rMoreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found
    faithful. &l3&rBut with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of
    you, or'
  '34': 'of man''s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. &l4&rFor I know nothing
    by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
    &l5&rTherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will
    bring to light the'
  '35': 'hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts:
    and then shall every man have praise of God. &l6&rAnd these things, brethren,
    I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye
    might learn in us'
  '36': not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. &l7&rFor who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as
  '37': 'if thou hadst not received it? &l8&rNow ye are full, now ye are rich, ye
    have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also
    might reign with you. &l9&rFor I think that God hath set forth us the apostles
    last, as it were'
  '38': 'appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels,
    and to men. &l10&rWe are fools for Christ''s sake, but ye are wise in Christ;
    we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. &l11&rEven
    unto this present'
  '39': 'hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have
    no certain dwellingplace; &l12&rAnd labour, working with our own hands: being
    reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: &l13&rBeing defamed, we intreat:
    we are made as the'
  '40': 'filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.
    &l14&rI write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.
    &l15&rFor though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many
    fathers: for in'
  '41': Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. &l16&rWherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. &l17&rFor this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways
  '42': which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. &l18&rNow some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. &l19&rBut I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
  '43': '&l20&rFor the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. &l21&rWhat will
    ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?'
  '44': 'Chapter 5

    It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication
    as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father''s
    wife. &l2&rAnd ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath'
  '45': done this deed might be taken away from among you. &l3&rFor I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed, &l4&rIn the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye
  '46': are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, &l5&rTo deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. &l6&rYour glorying is not good. Know ye not
  '47': 'that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? &l7&rPurge out therefore the
    old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our
    passover is sacrificed for us: &l8&rTherefore let us keep the feast, not with
    old leaven, neither'
  '48': 'with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of
    sincerity and truth. &l9&rI wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
    &l10&rYet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous,
    or'
  '49': extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. &l11&rBut now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an
  '50': extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. &l12&rFor what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? &l13&rBut them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.

  '1': 'Chapter 6 Cont.

    Chapter 6

    Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust,
    and not before the saints? &l2&rDo ye not know that the saints shall judge the
    world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge'
  '2': the smallest matters? &l3&rKnow ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? &l4&rIf then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. &l5&rI speak to
  '3': your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? &l6&rBut brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. &l7&rNow therefore there is utterly a fault among you,
  '4': because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? &l8&rNay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. &l9&rKnow ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom
  '5': 'of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
    nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, &l10&rNor thieves, nor
    covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom
    of God. &l11&rAnd'
  '6': 'such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
    justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. &l12&rAll
    things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful
    for me, but I'
  '7': 'will not be brought under the power of any. &l13&rMeats for the belly, and
    the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not
    for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. &l14&rAnd God hath
    both raised up the'
  '8': Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power. &l15&rKnow ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. &l16&rWhat? know ye not that he which is joined to
  '9': an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. &l17&rBut he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. &l18&rFlee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
  '10': '&l19&rWhat? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which
    is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? &l20&rFor ye are bought
    with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are
    God''s.'
  '11': 'Chapter 7

    Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to
    touch a woman. &l2&rNevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his
    own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. &l3&rLet the husband render
    unto'
  '12': 'the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. &l4&rThe
    wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband
    hath not power of his own body, but the wife. &l5&rDefraud ye not one the other,
    except it'
  '13': be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. &l6&rBut I speak this by permission, and not of commandment. &l7&rFor I would that all men were even as
  '14': 'I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner,
    and another after that. &l8&rI say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it is
    good for them if they abide even as I. &l9&rBut if they cannot contain, let them
    marry: for it is'
  '15': 'better to marry than to burn. &l10&rAnd unto the married I command, yet not
    I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: &l11&rBut and if she
    depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not
    the husband put away'
  '16': 'his wife. &l12&rBut to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath
    a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put
    her away. &l13&rAnd the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if
    he be pleased to'
  '17': 'dwell with her, let her not leave him. &l14&rFor the unbelieving husband
    is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband:
    else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. &l15&rBut if the unbelieving
    depart, let him'
  '18': 'depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God
    hath called us to peace. &l16&rFor what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt
    save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
    &l17&rBut as God hath'
  '19': distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches. &l18&rIs any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
  '20': '&l19&rCircumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping
    of the commandments of God. &l20&rLet every man abide in the same calling wherein
    he was called. &l21&rArt thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if
    thou mayest be'
  '21': 'made free, use it rather. &l22&rFor he that is called in the Lord, being
    a servant, is the Lord''s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free,
    is Christ''s servant. &l23&rYe are bought with a price; be not ye the servants
    of men. &l24&rBrethren,'
  '22': 'let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God. &l25&rNow concerning
    virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that
    hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. &l26&rI suppose therefore that
    this is good for'
  '23': the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be. &l27&rArt thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. &l28&rBut and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not
  '24': 'sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.
    &l29&rBut this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they
    that have wives be as though they had none; &l30&rAnd they that weep, as though
    they wept not; and'
  '25': 'they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though
    they possessed not; &l31&rAnd they that use this world, as not abusing it: for
    the fashion of this world passeth away. &l32&rBut I would have you without carefulness.
    He that is'
  '26': 'unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please
    the Lord: &l33&rBut he that is married careth for the things that are of the world,
    how he may please his wife. &l34&rThere is difference also between a wife and
    a virgin. The'
  '27': 'unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both
    in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world,
    how she may please her husband. &l35&rAnd this I speak for your own profit; not
    that I may cast'
  '28': a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. &l36&rBut if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do
  '29': 'what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry. &l37&rNevertheless he that
    standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own
    will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.
    &l38&rSo then he that'
  '30': giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better. &l39&rThe wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
  '31': '&l40&rBut she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think
    also that I have the Spirit of God.'
  '32': 'Chapter 8

    Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge.
    Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. &l2&rAnd if any man think that he
    knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. &l3&rBut if any
    man love'
  '33': God, the same is known of him. &l4&rAs concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one. &l5&rFor though there be that are
  '34': called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) &l6&rBut to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. &l7&rHowbeit
  '35': 'there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the
    idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience
    being weak is defiled. &l8&rBut meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if
    we eat, are we the'
  '36': better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. &l9&rBut take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. &l10&rFor if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the
  '37': conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; &l11&rAnd through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? &l12&rBut when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak
  '38': conscience, ye sin against Christ. &l13&rWherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
  '39': 'Chapter 9

    Am I am not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?
    are not ye my work in the Lord? &l2&rIf I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless
    I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. &l3&rMine'
  '40': answer to them that do examine me is this, &l4&rHave we not power to eat and to drink? &l5&rHave we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? &l6&rOr I only and Barnabas, have not we
  '41': power to forbear working? &l7&rWho goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? &l8&rSay I these things as a man? or saith not
  '42': 'the law the same also? &l9&rFor it is written in the law of Moses, thou shalt
    not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care
    for oxen? &l10&rOr saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt,
    this is written:'
  '43': that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. &l11&rIf we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? &l12&rIf others be partakers of this
  '44': power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. &l13&rDo ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which
  '45': 'wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? &l14&rEven so hath the Lord
    ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. &l15&rBut
    I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it
    should be so done'
  '46': 'unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make
    my glorying void. &l16&rFor though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory

    of the gospel is committed unto me. &l18&rWhat is my reward then? Verily that,
    when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that
    I abuse not my power'
  '48': in the gospel. &l19&rFor though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. &l20&rAnd unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I
  '49': might gain them that are under the law; &l21&rTo them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. &l22&rTo the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the

    Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers
    were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; &l2&rAnd were all baptized
    unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; &l3&rAnd did all eat the same spiritual'
  '5': 'meat; &l4&rAnd did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that
    spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. &l5&rBut with many
    of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
    &l6&rNow these'
  '6': things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. &l7&rNeither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. &l8&rNeither let us commit
  '7': fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. &l9&rNeither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. &l10&rNeither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
  '8': 'destroyed of the destroyer. &l11&rNow all these things happened unto them
    for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the
    world are come. &l12&rWherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest
    he fall. &l13&rThere'

    temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. &l14&rWherefore,
    my dearly'
  '10': beloved, flee from idolatry. &l15&rI speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. &l16&rThe cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? &l17&rFor we
  '11': 'being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that
    one bread. &l18&rBehold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
    sacrifices partakers of the altar? &l19&rWhat say I then? that the idol is any
    thing, or that which is'
  '12': 'offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? &l20&rBut I say, that the things
    which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I
    would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. &l21&rYe cannot drink the
    cup of the Lord, and'
  '13': 'the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord''s table, and of the
    table of devils. &l22&rDo we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than
    he? &l23&rAll things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all
    things are lawful for'
  '14': 'me, but all things edify not. &l24&rLet no man seek his own, but every man
    another''s wealth. &l25&rWhatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking
    no question for conscience sake: &l26&rFor the earth is the Lord''s, and the fulness
    thereof. &l27&rIf'
  '15': any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake. &l28&rBut if any man say unto you, this is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that

    fulness thereof: &l29&rConscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for
    why is my liberty judged of another man''s conscience? &l30&rFor if I by grace

    Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. &l2&rNow I praise you, brethren,
    that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them
    to you. &l3&rBut I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ;'
  '20': 'and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. &l4&rEvery
    man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. &l5&rBut
    every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her
    head: for'
  '21': 'that is even all one as if she were shaven. &l6&rFor if the woman be not
    covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or
    shaven, let her be covered. &l7&rFor a man indeed ought not to cover his head,
    forasmuch as he is the'
  '22': 'image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. &l8&rFor the
    man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man. &l9&rNeither was the man created
    for the woman; but the woman for the man. &l10&rFor this cause ought the woman
    to have power on'
  '23': her head because of the angels. &l11&rNevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. &l12&rFor as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God. &l13&rJudge in
  '24': 'yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? &l14&rDoth
    not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame
    unto him? &l15&rBut if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair
    is given her for a'
  '25': covering. &l16&rBut if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. &l17&rNow in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. &l18&rFor first of all,
  '26': when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. &l19&rFor there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. &l20&rWhen ye come together therefore into
  '27': 'one place, this is not to eat the Lord''s supper. &l21&rFor in eating every
    one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
    &l22&rWhat? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church
    of God, and shame'
  '28': 'them that have not? what shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this?
    I praise you not. &l23&rFor I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered
    unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
    &l24&rAnd when he'
  '29': 'had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which
    is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. &l25&rAfter the same manner also
    he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in
    my blood: this do ye,'
  '30': as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. &l26&rFor as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. &l27&rWherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty
  '31': of the body and blood of the Lord. &l28&rBut let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. &l29&rFor he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
  '32': '&l30&rFor this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
    &l31&rFor if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. &l32&rBut when
    we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with
    the world.'
  '33': '&l33&rWherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for
    another. &l34&rAnd if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together
    unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.'
  '34': 'Chapter 12

    Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. &l2&rYe
    know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were
    led. &l3&rWherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit

    &l5&rAnd there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. &l6&rAnd
    there are'
  '36': diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. &l7&rBut the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. &l8&rFor to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the
  '37': same Spirit; &l9&rTo another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; &l10&rTo another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the
  '38': 'interpretation of tongues: &l11&rBut all these worketh that one and the selfsame
    Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. &l12&rFor as the body is one,
    and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one
    body: so'
  '39': also is Christ. &l13&rFor by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. &l14&rFor the body is not one member, but many. &l15&rIf the foot shall
  '40': say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? &l16&rAnd if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? &l17&rIf the whole body were an eye, where were the
  '41': hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? &l18&rBut now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. &l19&rAnd if they were all one member, where were the body? &l20&rBut now are they many members, yet
  '42': 'but one body. &l21&rAnd the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need
    of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. &l22&rNay, much
    more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: &l23&rAnd
    those members of'
  '43': 'the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more
    abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. &l24&rFor
    our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having
    given more abundant'
  '44': honour to that part which lacked. &l25&rThat there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. &l26&rAnd whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the
  '45': members rejoice with it. &l27&rNow ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. &l28&rAnd God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments,
  '46': 'diversities of tongues. &l29&rAre all apostles? are all prophets? are all
    teachers? are all workers of miracles? &l30&rHave all the gifts of healing? do
    all speak with tongues? do all interpret? &l31&rBut covet earnestly the best gifts:
    and yet shew I unto'

    but rather'
  '7': 'that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh
    with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying. &l6&rNow,
    brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except
    I shall'
  '8': speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? &l7&rAnd even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
  '9': '&l8&rFor if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself
    to the battle? &l9&rSo likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to
    be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the
    air. &l10&rThere'
  '10': are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification. &l11&rTherefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.
  '11': '&l12&rEven so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that
    ye may excel to the edifying of the church. &l13&rWherefore let him that speaketh
    in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret. &l14&rFor if I pray in an unknown
    tongue, my'
  '12': 'spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. &l15&rWhat is it then?
    I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will
    sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. &l16&rElse
    when thou shalt bless'
  '13': with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? &l17&rFor thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. &l18&rI thank my God, I speak
  '14': 'with tongues more than ye all: &l19&rYet in the church I had rather speak
    five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also,
    than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. &l20&rBrethren, be not children
    in understanding: howbeit'
  '15': in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men. &l21&rIn the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord. &l22&rWherefore tongues are for a
  '16': 'sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying
    serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe. &l23&rIf therefore
    the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues,
    and there come'

    mad? &l24&rBut if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one
    unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: &l25&rAnd thus are the
    secrets of his heart'
  '18': made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth. &l26&rHow is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an
  '19': interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. &l27&rIf any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. &l28&rBut if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the
  '20': church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. &l29&rLet the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. &l30&rIf any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. &l31&rFor ye may all prophesy one by one, that
  '21': 'all may learn, and all may be comforted. &l32&rAnd the spirits of the prophets
    are subject to the prophets. &l33&rFor God is not the author of confusion, but

    Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which
    also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; &l2&rBy which also ye are saved,
    if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.'
  '26': '&l3&rFor I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how
    that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; &l4&rAnd that he was
    buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: &l5&rAnd
    that he was seen'
  '27': 'of Cephas, then of the twelve: &l6&rAfter that, he was seen of above five
    hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but
    some are fallen asleep. &l7&rAfter that, he was seen of James; then of all the
    apostles. &l8&rAnd'
  '28': 'last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. &l9&rFor
    I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because
    I persecuted the church of God. &l10&rBut by the grace of God I am what I am:
    and his grace which'
  '29': 'was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than
    they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. &l11&rTherefore whether
    it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. &l12&rNow if Christ be preached
    that he rose'
  '30': 'from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the
    dead? &l13&rBut if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
    &l14&rAnd if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is
    also vain.'
  '31': '&l15&rYea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified
    of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead
    rise not. &l16&rFor if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: &l17&rAnd
    if Christ be not'
  '32': raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. &l18&rThen they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. &l19&rIf in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. &l20&rBut now is Christ risen from the dead, and
  '33': 'become the firstfruits of them that slept. &l21&rFor since by man came death,
    by man came also the resurrection of the dead. &l22&rFor as in Adam all die, even
    so in Christ shall all be made alive. &l23&rBut every man in his own order: Christ
    the'
  '34': firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. &l24&rThen cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. &l25&rFor he must reign, till he
  '35': hath put all enemies under his feet. &l26&rThe last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. &l27&rFor he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under
  '36': him. &l28&rAnd when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. &l29&rElse what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at
  '37': all? why are they then baptized for the dead? &l30&rAnd why stand we in jeopardy every hour? &l31&rI protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. &l32&rIf after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what
  '38': 'advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow
    we die. &l33&rBe not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. &l34&rAwake
    to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak
    this to your'
  '39': 'shame. &l35&rBut some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with
    what body do they come? &l36&rThou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened,
    except it die: &l37&rAnd that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that
    shall be, but bare'
  '40': 'grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: &l38&rBut God giveth
    it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. &l39&rAll flesh
    is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of
    beasts, another of'

    bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the
    terrestrial is another. &l41&rThere is one glory of the sun, and another glory
    of the moon, and another'
  '42': 'glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. &l42&rSo
    also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in
    incorruption: &l43&rIt is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown
    in weakness; it'
  '43': 'is raised in power: &l44&rIt is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual
    body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. &l45&rAnd so it
    is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made
    a quickening spirit.'
  '44': '&l46&rHowbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural;
    and afterward that which is spiritual. &l47&rThe first man is of the earth, earthy;
    the second man is the Lord from heaven. &l48&rAs is the earthy, such are they
    also that are'
  '45': 'earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. &l49&rAnd
    as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the
    heavenly. &l50&rNow this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
    the kingdom of God;'
  '46': 'neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. &l51&rBehold, I shew you a
    mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, &l52&rIn a moment,
    in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and
    the dead shall be'
  '47': raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. &l53&rFor this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. &l54&rSo when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then
  '48': shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. &l55&rO death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? &l56&rThe sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. &l57&rBut thanks be to God, which
  '49': giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. &l58&rTherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
  '50': 'Chapter 16

    Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches
    of Galatia, even so do ye.'

  '1': 'Chapter 16 Cont.

    &l2&rUpon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store,
    as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. &l3&rAnd when
    I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring'
  '2': 'your liberality unto Jerusalem. &l4&rAnd if it be meet that I go also, they
    shall go with me. &l5&rNow I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia:
    for I do pass through Macedonia. &l6&rAnd it may be that I will abide, yea, and
    winter with'
  '3': you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. &l7&rFor I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. &l8&rBut I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. &l9&rFor a great door and effectual is
  '4': 'opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. &l10&rNow if Timotheus come,
    see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord,
    as I also do. &l11&rLet no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in
    peace, that he may'
  '5': 'come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. &l12&rAs touching our
    brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but
    his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have
    convenient time.'
  '6': '&l13&rWatch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. &l14&rLet
    all your things be done with charity. &l15&rI beseech you, brethren, (ye know
    the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have
    addicted'
  '7': 'themselves to the ministry of the saints,) &l16&rThat ye submit yourselves
    unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth. &l17&rI am glad
    of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking
    on your part they'
  '8': 'have supplied. &l18&rFor they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore
    acknowledge ye them that are such. &l19&rThe churches of Asia salute you. Aquila
    and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
    &l20&rAll the'
  '9': brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss. &l21&rThe salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. &l22&rIf any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. &l23&rThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. &l24&rMy
  '10': love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
