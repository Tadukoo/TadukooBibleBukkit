  '1': Chapter 1/nThat which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; &l2&r(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and
  '2': 'shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested
    unto us;) &l3&rThat which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye
    also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father,
    and with his Son'
  '3': Jesus Christ. &l4&rAnd these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. &l5&rThis then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. &l6&rIf we say that we have fellowship
  '4': 'with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: &l7&rBut if
    we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another,
    and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. &l8&rIf we say
    that we have no sin,'
  '5': we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. &l9&rIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. &l10&rIf we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in
  '6': us.
  '7': 'Chapter 2/nMy little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
    not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
    righteous: &l2&rAnd he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only,
    but also for the sins'
  '8': of the whole world. &l3&rAnd hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. &l4&rHe that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. &l5&rBut whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the
  '9': 'love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. &l6&rHe that saith
    he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. &l7&rBrethren,
    I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from
    the beginning. The'
  '10': 'old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. &l8&rAgain,
    a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because
    the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. &l9&rHe that saith he is
    in the light,'
  '11': and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. &l10&rHe that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. &l11&rBut he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not
  '12': whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. &l12&rI write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. &l13&rI write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write
  '13': unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father. &l14&rI have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young
  '14': men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. &l15&rLove not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. &l16&rFor all that is
  '15': 'in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride
    of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. &l17&rAnd the world passeth
    away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
    &l18&rLittle'
  '16': 'children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall
    come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last
    time. &l19&rThey went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been
    of us, they would no'
  '17': 'doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made
    manifest that they were not all of us. &l20&rBut ye have an unction from the Holy
    One, and ye know all things. &l21&rI have not written unto you because ye know
    not the truth, but'
  '18': 'because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. &l22&rWho is a liar
    but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the
    Father and the Son. &l23&rWhosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father:
    he that'
  '19': acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. &l24&rLet that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. &l25&rAnd
  '20': 'this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life. &l26&rThese
    things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. &l27&rBut the
    anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any
    man teach you: but'
  '21': as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. &l28&rAnd now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed
  '22': before him at his coming. &l29&rIf ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.
  '23': 'Chapter 3/nBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
    that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not,
    because it knew him not. &l2&rBeloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth
    not yet appear what we'
  '24': 'shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for
    we shall see him as he is. &l3&rAnd every man that hath this hope in him purifieth
    himself, even as he is pure. &l4&rWhosoever committeth sin transgresseth also
    the law: for sin is'
  '25': 'the transgression of the law. &l5&rAnd ye know that he was manifested to
    take away our sins; and in him is no sin. &l6&rWhosoever abideth in him sinneth
    not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. &l7&rLittle children,
    let no man deceive'
  '26': 'you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. &l8&rHe
    that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning.
    For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works
    of the devil.'
  '27': '&l9&rWhosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth
    in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. &l10&rIn this the children
    of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness
    is not of God,'
  '28': neither he that loveth not his brother. &l11&rFor this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. &l12&rNot as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works
  '29': were evil, and his brother's righteous. &l13&rMarvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. &l14&rWe know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. &l15&rWhosoever hateth his
  '30': 'brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding
    in him. &l16&rHereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life
    for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. &l17&rBut whoso hath
    this world''s'
  '31': good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? &l18&rMy little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. &l19&rAnd hereby we know that we
  '32': are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. &l20&rFor if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. &l21&rBeloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. &l22&rAnd whatsoever we ask,
  '33': we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. &l23&rAnd this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
  '34': '&l24&rAnd he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.
    And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.'
  '35': 'Chapter 4/nBeloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
    they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. &l2&rHereby
    know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come
    in the flesh'
  '36': 'is of God: &l3&rAnd every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is
    come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof
    ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. &l4&rYe
    are of God, little'
  '37': 'children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than
    he that is in the world. &l5&rThey are of the world: therefore speak they of the
    world, and the world heareth them. &l6&rWe are of God: he that knoweth God heareth
    us; he that is'
  '38': 'not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit
    of error. &l7&rBeloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every
    one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. &l8&rHe that loveth not knoweth
    not God; for God'
  '39': is love. &l9&rIn this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. &l10&rHerein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
  '40': propitiation for our sins. &l11&rBeloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. &l12&rNo man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. &l13&rHereby know we that we dwell in him,
  '41': and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. &l14&rAnd we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. &l15&rWhosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
  '42': '&l16&rAnd we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is
    love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. &l17&rHerein
    is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because
    as he is, so are'
  '43': 'we in this world. &l18&rThere is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth
    out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
    &l19&rWe love him, because he first loved us. &l20&rIf a man say, I love God,
    and hateth his'
  '44': 'brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,
    how can he love God whom he hath not seen? &l21&rAnd this commandment have we
    from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.'
  '45': 'Chapter 5/nWhosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and
    every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
    &l2&rBy this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep
    his commandments.'
  '46': '&l3&rFor this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his
    commandments are not grievous. &l4&rFor whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
    world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. &l5&rWho
    is he that'
  '47': overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? &l6&rThis is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
  '48': '&l7&rFor there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word,
    and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. &l8&rAnd there are three that bear
    witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree
    in one. &l9&rIf we'
  '49': 'receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the
    witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. &l10&rHe that believeth on
    the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made
    him a liar; because he'
  '50': believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. &l11&rAnd this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. &l12&rHe that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.

  '1': Chapter 5 Cont./n&l13&rThese things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. &l14&rAnd this is the confidence that we have in him,
  '2': 'that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: &l15&rAnd
    if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions
    that we desired of him. &l16&rIf any man see his brother sin a sin which is not
    unto death, he shall'
  '3': 'ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is
    a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. &l17&rAll unrighteousness
    is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. &l18&rWe know that whosoever is born
    of God sinneth'
  '4': not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. &l19&rAnd we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. &l20&rAnd we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding,
  '5': that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. &l21&rLittle children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
