  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes,
    but he gat no heat. &l2&rWherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought
    for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let'
  '2': her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. &l3&rSo they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. &l4&rAnd the damsel was very fair,
  '3': 'and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
    &l5&rThen Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king:
    and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. &l6&rAnd
    his father had not'
  '4': 'displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was
    a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom. &l7&rAnd he conferred
    with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following
    Adonijah helped him.'
  '5': ' &l8&rBut Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the
    prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were
    not with Adonijah. &l9&rAnd Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the
    stone of Zoheleth,'
  '6': 'which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king''s sons, and all
    the men of Judah the king''s servants: &l10&rBut Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah,
    and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not. &l11&rWherefore Nathan
    spake unto'
  '7': Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not? &l12&rNow therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the
  '8': life of thy son Solomon. &l13&rGo and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah
  '9': 'reign? &l14&rBehold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will
    come in after thee, and confirm thy words. &l15&rAnd Bathsheba went in unto the
    king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered
    unto the'
  '10': king. &l16&rAnd Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? &l17&rAnd she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the Lord thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and
  '11': 'he shall sit upon my throne. &l18&rAnd now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and
    now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not: &l19&rAnd he hath slain oxen and fat
    cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar
    the priest,'
  '12': 'and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
    &l20&rAnd thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou
    shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
    &l21&rOtherwise it'
  '13': shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders. &l22&rAnd, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. &l23&rAnd they told the king, saying, Behold
  '14': Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. &l24&rAnd Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? &l25&rFor he
  '15': is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
  '16': '&l26&rBut me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the
    son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called. &l27&rIs this thing
    done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should
    sit on the throne'
  '17': of my lord the king after him? &l28&rThen king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. &l29&rAnd the king sware, and said, As the Lord liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all
  '18': distress, &l30&rEven as I sware unto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day. &l31&rThen Bathsheba bowed with her face to the
  '19': earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever. &l32&rAnd king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. &l33&rThe king also said unto
  '20': 'them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to
    ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon: &l34&rAnd let Zadok the
    priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with
    the trumpet, and say,'
  '21': 'God save king Solomon. &l35&rThen ye shall come up after him, that he may
    come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed
    him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. &l36&rAnd Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
    answered the'
  '22': 'king, and said, Amen: the Lord God of my lord the king say so too. &l37&rAs
    the Lord hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make
    his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David. &l38&rSo Zadok the priest,
    and Nathan the'
  '23': prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. &l39&rAnd Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed
  '24': Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon. &l40&rAnd all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them. &l41&rAnd Adonijah
  '25': and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar? &l42&rAnd while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of
  '26': Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings. &l43&rAnd Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. &l44&rAnd the king hath sent with him
  '27': 'Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
    and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon
    the king''s mule: &l45&rAnd Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed
    him king in Gihon:'
  '28': and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard. &l46&rAnd also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. &l47&rAnd moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying,
  '29': God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed. &l48&rAnd also thus said the king, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this
  '30': day, mine eyes even seeing it. &l49&rAnd all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. &l50&rAnd Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. &l51&rAnd it
  '31': 'was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo,
    he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear
    unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword. &l52&rAnd Solomon
    said, If he will shew'
  '32': 'himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but
    if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die. &l53&rSo king Solomon sent,
    and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king
    Solomon: and Solomon'
  '33': said unto him, Go to thine house.
  '34': 'Chapter 2

    Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his
    son, saying, &l2&rI go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and
    shew thyself a man; &l3&rAnd keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his
    ways,'
  '35': 'to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies,
    as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou
    doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself: &l4&rThat the Lord may continue
    his word'
  '36': which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel. &l5&rMoreover thou knowest also what
  '37': Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was
  '38': about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet. &l6&rDo therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. &l7&rBut shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat
  '39': 'at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
    &l8&rAnd, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim,
    which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but
    he came'
  '40': 'down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the Lord, saying, I will
    not put thee to death with the sword. &l9&rNow therefore hold him not guiltless:
    for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his
    hoar head bring thou'
  '41': 'down to the grave with blood. &l10&rSo David slept with his fathers, and
    was buried in the city of David. &l11&rAnd the days that David reigned over Israel
    were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
    reigned he in'
  '42': Jerusalem. &l12&rThen sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly. &l13&rAnd Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
  '43': '&l14&rHe said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say
    on. &l15&rAnd he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel
    set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about,
    and is become my'
  '44': 'brother''s: for it was his from the Lord. &l16&rAnd now I ask one petition
    of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on. &l17&rAnd he said, Speak,
    I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give
    me Abishag the'
  '45': Shunammite to wife. &l18&rAnd Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king. &l19&rBathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his
  '46': 'throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king''s mother; and she sat on
    his right hand. &l20&rThen she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray
    thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will
    not say thee nay.'
  '47': '&l21&rAnd she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother
    to wife. &l22&rAnd king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost
    thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for
    he is mine elder'
  '48': brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. &l23&rThen king Solomon sware by the Lord, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. &l24&rNow therefore, as the
  '49': Lord liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. &l25&rAnd king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell
  '50': upon him that he died.

  '1': 'Chapter 2 Cont.

    &l26&rAnd unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine
    own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee
    to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord God before David my father,'
  '2': and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. &l27&rSo Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the Lord; that he might fulfil the word of the Lord, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. &l28&rThen
  '3': 'tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned
    not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold
    on the horns of the altar. &l29&rAnd it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled
    unto the'
  '4': tabernacle of the Lord; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. &l30&rAnd Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay;
  '5': but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me. &l31&rAnd the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab
  '6': shed, from me, and from the house of my father. &l32&rAnd the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son
  '7': 'of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain
    of the host of Judah. &l33&rTheir blood shall therefore return upon the head of
    Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed,
    and upon his house,'
  '8': 'and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the Lord. &l34&rSo
    Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was
    buried in his own house in the wilderness. &l35&rAnd the king put Benaiah the
    son of Jehoiada in his'
  '9': 'room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
    &l36&rAnd the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an
    house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. &l37&rFor
    it shall'
  '10': 'be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou
    shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine
    own head. &l38&rAnd Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord
    the king hath said,'
  '11': so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days. &l39&rAnd it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be
  '12': 'in Gath. &l40&rAnd Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to
    Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
    &l41&rAnd it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and
    was come again.'
  '13': '&l42&rAnd the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not
    make thee to swear by the Lord, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain,
    on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely
    die? and thou'
  '14': saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good. &l43&rWhy then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment that I have charged thee with? &l44&rThe king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is
  '15': 'privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the Lord shall return
    thy wickedness upon thine own head; &l45&rAnd king Solomon shall be blessed, and
    the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever. &l46&rSo the
    king commanded'
  '16': Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
  '17': 'Chapter 3

    And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh''s daughter,
    and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his
    own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.'
  '18': '&l2&rOnly the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house
    built unto the name of the Lord, until those days. &l3&rAnd Solomon loved the
    Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt
    incense in high places.'
  '19': ' &l4&rAnd the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great
    high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar. &l5&rIn
    Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what
    I shall give'
  '20': thee. &l6&rAnd Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou
  '21': 'hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. &l7&rAnd now,
    O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and
    I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in. &l8&rAnd thy servant
    is in the midst of'
  '22': 'thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered
    nor counted for multitude. &l9&rGive therefore thy servant an understanding heart
    to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able
    to judge this thy so'
  '23': great a people? &l10&rAnd the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. &l11&rAnd God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the
  '24': 'life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern
    judgment; &l12&rBehold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee
    a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,
    neither after thee'
  '25': 'shall any arise like unto thee. &l13&rAnd I have also given thee that which
    thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among
    the kings like unto thee all thy days. &l14&rAnd if thou wilt walk in my ways,
    to keep my'
  '26': statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days. &l15&rAnd Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings,
  '27': and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. &l16&rThen came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. &l17&rAnd the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of
  '28': 'a child with her in the house. &l18&rAnd it came to pass the third day after
    that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together;
    there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. &l19&rAnd
    this woman''s child'
  '29': died in the night; because she overlaid it. &l20&rAnd she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. &l21&rAnd when I rose in the morning to give my child
  '30': 'suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold,
    it was not my son, which I did bear. &l22&rAnd the other woman said, Nay; but
    the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead
    is thy son, and the'
  '31': 'living is my son. Thus they spake before the king. &l23&rThen said the king,
    The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other
    saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. &l24&rAnd the king
    said, Bring me'
  '32': a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. &l25&rAnd the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. &l26&rThen spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon
  '33': 'her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise
    slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.
    &l27&rThen the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise
    slay it: she is the'
  '34': 'mother thereof. &l28&rAnd all Israel heard of the judgment which the king
    had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was
    in him, to do judgment.'
  '35': 'Chapter 4

    So king Solomon was king over all Israel. &l2&rAnd these were the princes which
    he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest, &l3&rElihoreph and Ahiah, the sons
    of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder. &l4&rAnd Benaiah
    the'
  '36': 'son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
    &l5&rAnd Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of
    Nathan was principal officer, and the king''s friend: &l6&rAnd Ahishar was over
    the household: and'
  '37': 'Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute. &l7&rAnd Solomon had twelve
    officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household:
    each man his month in a year made provision. &l8&rAnd these are their names: The
    son of Hur, in'
  '38': 'mount Ephraim: &l9&rThe son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh,
    and Elonbethhanan: &l10&rThe son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh,
    and all the land of Hepher: &l11&rThe son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor;
    which had'
  '39': 'Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: &l12&rBaana the son of Ahilud; to
    him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath
    Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:
    &l13&rThe son'
  '40': 'of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of
    Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which
    is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars: &l14&rAhinadab
    the son of Iddo had'
  '41': 'Mahanaim: &l15&rAhimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter
    of Solomon to wife: &l16&rBaanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:
    &l17&rJehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: &l18&rShimei the son of Elah,
    in Benjamin:'
  '42': '&l19&rGeber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of
    Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer
    which was in the land. &l20&rJudah and Israel were many, as the sand which is
    by the sea in'
  '43': 'multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. &l21&rAnd Solomon reigned
    over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the
    border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his
    life. &l22&rAnd'
  '44': Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, &l23&rTen fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. &l24&rFor he had
  '45': 'dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to
    Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides
    round about him. &l25&rAnd Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his
    vine and under his fig'
  '46': tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. &l26&rAnd Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. &l27&rAnd those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king

    also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where
    the officers were, every man according to his charge. &l29&rAnd God gave Solomon
    wisdom and'
  '48': understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. &l30&rAnd Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. &l31&rFor he was wiser than all men; than
  '49': 'Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol:
    and his fame was in all nations round about. &l32&rAnd he spake three thousand
    proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. &l33&rAnd he spake of trees,
    from the cedar tree that'
  '50': 'is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake
    also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.'

    And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they
    had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of
    David. &l2&rAnd Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, &l3&rThou knowest how that David
    my'
  '3': father could not build an house unto the name of the Lord his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet. &l4&rBut now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither
  '4': adversary nor evil occurrent. &l5&rAnd, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.
  '5': '&l6&rNow therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon;
    and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for
    thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there
    is not among us'
  '6': any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians. &l7&rAnd it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
  '7': '&l8&rAnd Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which
    thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar,
    and concerning timber of fir. &l9&rMy servants shall bring them down from Lebanon
    unto the sea: and'
  '8': 'I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint
    me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and
    thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household. &l10&rSo Hiram
    gave Solomon cedar'
  '9': 'trees and fir trees according to all his desire. &l11&rAnd Solomon gave Hiram
    twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures
    of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. &l12&rAnd the Lord gave
    Solomon wisdom, as'
  '10': 'he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they
    two made a league together. &l13&rAnd king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel;
    and the levy was thirty thousand men. &l14&rAnd he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand
    a month by'
  '11': 'courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram
    was over the levy. &l15&rAnd Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare
    burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; &l16&rBeside the chief
    of Solomon''s officers'
  '12': which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work. &l17&rAnd the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house. &l18&rAnd
  '13': 'Solomon''s builders and Hiram''s builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers:
    so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.'
  '14': 'Chapter 6

    And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children
    of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon''s
    reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began
    to build the'
  '15': house of the Lord. &l2&rAnd the house which king Solomon built for the Lord, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits. &l3&rAnd the porch before the temple of the house, twenty
  '16': cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house. &l4&rAnd for the house he made windows of narrow lights. &l5&rAnd against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
  '17': 'against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the
    oracle: and he made chambers round about: &l6&rThe nethermost chamber was five
    cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits
    broad: for without in'
  '18': 'the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams
    should not be fastened in the walls of the house. &l7&rAnd the house, when it
    was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither:
    so that there was neither'
  '19': 'hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
    &l8&rThe door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they
    went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into
    the third.'
  '20': '&l9&rSo he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams
    and boards of cedar. &l10&rAnd then he built chambers against all the house, five
    cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. &l11&rAnd the
    word of the Lord'
  '21': came to Solomon, saying, &l12&rConcerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy
  '22': 'father: &l13&rAnd I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not
    forsake my people Israel. &l14&rSo Solomon built the house, and finished it. &l15&rAnd
    he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of
    the house, and'
  '23': 'the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and
    covered the floor of the house with planks of fir. &l16&rAnd he built twenty cubits
    on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar:
    he even built them'
  '24': 'for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place. &l17&rAnd
    the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long. &l18&rAnd the
    cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar;
    there was no stone'
  '25': 'seen. &l19&rAnd the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there
    the ark of the covenant of the Lord. &l20&rAnd the oracle in the forepart was
    twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the
    height thereof: and he'
  '26': 'overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.
    &l21&rSo Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition
    by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. &l22&rAnd
    the whole house he'
  '27': 'overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar
    that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold. &l23&rAnd within the oracle he made
    two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high. &l24&rAnd five cubits was the
    one wing of the'
  '28': 'cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost
    part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits. &l25&rAnd
    the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one
    size. &l26&rThe'
  '29': 'height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
    &l27&rAnd he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth
    the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall,
    and the wing of the'
  '30': other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. &l28&rAnd he overlaid the cherubims with gold. &l29&rAnd he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees
  '31': 'and open flowers, within and without. &l30&rAnd the floors of the house he
    overlaid with gold, within and without. &l31&rAnd for the entering of the oracle
    he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the
    wall. &l32&rThe two'
  '32': doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees. &l33&rSo also made he for the door of the temple posts
  '33': 'of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall. &l34&rAnd the two doors were of
    fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the
    other door were folding. &l35&rAnd he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees
    and open flowers: and'
  '34': 'covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work. &l36&rAnd he built the
    inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams. &l37&rIn
    the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid, in the month
    Zif: &l38&rAnd in the'
  '35': eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.
  '36': 'Chapter 7

    But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his
    house. &l2&rHe built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof
    was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof'
  '37': thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. &l3&rAnd it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row. &l4&rAnd there were windows in three rows, and light was against
  '38': 'light in three ranks. &l5&rAnd all the doors and posts were square, with
    the windows: and light was against light in three ranks. &l6&rAnd he made a porch
    of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty
    cubits: and the porch'
  '39': 'was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.
    &l7&rThen he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch
    of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
    &l8&rAnd his house'
  '40': where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch. &l9&rAll these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed
  '41': stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court. &l10&rAnd the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
  '42': '&l11&rAnd above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and
    cedars. &l12&rAnd the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones,
    and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the Lord, and
    for the porch of'
  '43': 'the house. &l13&rAnd king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. &l14&rHe
    was a widow''s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre,
    a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning
    to work all works'
  '44': 'in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. &l15&rFor
    he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve
    cubits did compass either of them about. &l16&rAnd he made two chapiters of molten
    brass, to set'
  '45': 'upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits,
    and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits: &l17&rAnd nets of checker
    work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of
    the pillars; seven'
  '46': 'for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. &l18&rAnd he made
    the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters
    that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.
    &l19&rAnd the'
  '47': 'chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the
    porch, four cubits. &l20&rAnd the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates
    also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates
    were two hundred in'
  '48': 'rows round about upon the other chapiter. &l21&rAnd he set up the pillars
    in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name
    thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
    &l22&rAnd upon the'
  '49': 'top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
    &l23&rAnd he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it
    was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits
    did compass it round'
  '50': 'about. &l24&rAnd under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing
    it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two
    rows, when it was cast.'

  '2': 'inward. &l26&rAnd it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought
    like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
    &l27&rAnd he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base,
    and four cubits'
  '3': 'the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it. &l28&rAnd the work
    of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between
    the ledges: &l29&rAnd on the borders that were between the ledges were lions,
    oxen, and cherubims:'
  '4': 'and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen

    and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel
    was a cubit and half a cubit. &l33&rAnd the work of the wheels was like the work
    of a chariot'
  '7': 'wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,
    were all molten. &l34&rAnd there were four undersetters to the four corners of

    and palm trees,'
  '9': 'according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about. &l37&rAfter
    this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and
    one size. &l38&rThen made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths:
    and every'
  '10': 'laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. &l39&rAnd
    he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of
    the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against
    the south.'
  '11': '&l40&rAnd Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram

    bases; &l44&rAnd one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea; &l45&rAnd the pots, and
    the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon
    for the house'
  '14': 'of the Lord, were of bright brass. &l46&rIn the plain of Jordan did the king
    cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan. &l47&rAnd Solomon left
    all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight
    of the brass'
  '15': 'found out. &l48&rAnd Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the
    house of the Lord: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread
    was, &l49&rAnd the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five
    on the left,'
  '16': before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, &l50&rAnd the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy
  '17': place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple. &l51&rSo was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the
  '18': vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord.
  '19': 'Chapter 8

    Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes,
    the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem,
    that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of'
  '20': David, which is Zion. &l2&rAnd all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. &l3&rAnd all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. &l4&rAnd they brought up the
  '21': ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up. &l5&rAnd king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him,
  '22': were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. &l6&rAnd the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even
  '23': under the wings of the cherubims. &l7&rFor the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. &l8&rAnd they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in
  '24': 'the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there
    they are unto this day. &l9&rThere was nothing in the ark save the two tables
    of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the
    children of Israel,'
  '25': 'when they came out of the land of Egypt. &l10&rAnd it came to pass, when

    cloud: for the glory of'

  '27': 'face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation
    of Israel stood;) &l15&rAnd he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which
    spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it,
    saying,'
  '28': '&l16&rSince the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I
    chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name
    might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. &l17&rAnd it
    was in the heart of David'
  '29': my father to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel. &l18&rAnd the Lord said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart. &l19&rNevertheless thou shalt not
  '30': build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name. &l20&rAnd the Lord hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the
  '31': Lord promised, and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel. &l21&rAnd I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. &l22&rAnd
  '32': 'Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation
    of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven: &l23&rAnd he said, Lord God
    of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who
    keepest'
  '33': 'covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their
    heart: &l24&rWho hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst
    him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand,
    as it is this day.'
  '34': '&l25&rTherefore now, Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father
    that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight
    to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that
    they walk before'
  '35': me as thou hast walked before me. &l26&rAnd now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. &l27&rBut will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot
  '36': 'contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded? &l28&rYet have
    thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Lord my
    God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before
    thee to day:'
  '37': '&l29&rThat thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward

  '6': among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God. &l54&rAnd it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and
  '7': supplication unto the Lord, he arose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven. &l55&rAnd he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, &l56&rBlessed be the Lord, that
  '8': 'hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised:
    there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the
    hand of Moses his servant. &l57&rThe Lord our God be with us, as he was with our

    to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his

    I have made'

    may know that the'
  '11': Lord is God, and that there is none else. &l61&rLet your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day. &l62&rAnd the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the
  '12': Lord. &l63&rAnd Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord. &l64&rThe
  '13': 'same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the
    house of the Lord: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and
    the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the Lord
    was too little to'
  '14': receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings. &l65&rAnd at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the Lord our
  '15': 'God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. &l66&rOn the eighth day
    he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents

    they shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land, and to this house?
    &l9&rAnd they shall'

    fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have
    worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all
    this evil. &l10&rAnd it'
  '23': came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the king's house, &l11&r(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his
  '24': desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. &l12&rAnd Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not. &l13&rAnd he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me,
  '25': my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day. &l14&rAnd Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. &l15&rAnd this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the Lord, and his own house, and Millo,
  '26': and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. &l16&rFor Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's
  '27': wife. &l17&rAnd Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, &l18&rAnd Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, &l19&rAnd all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which
  '28': Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. &l20&rAnd all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, &l21&rTheir
  '29': 'children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel
    also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of
    bondservice unto this day. &l22&rBut of the children of Israel did Solomon make
    no bondmen: but they'
  '30': were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen. &l23&rThese were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that
  '31': 'wrought in the work. &l24&rBut Pharaoh''s daughter came up out of the city
    of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.
    &l25&rAnd three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings
    upon the altar'
  '32': which he built unto the Lord, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the Lord. So he finished the house. &l26&rAnd king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
  '33': '&l27&rAnd Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge
    of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. &l28&rAnd they came to Ophir, and fetched
    from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.'
  '34': 'Chapter 10

    And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of
    the Lord, she came to prove him with hard questions. &l2&rAnd she came to Jerusalem
    with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and'
  '35': 'precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him
    of all that was in her heart. &l3&rAnd Solomon told her all her questions: there
    was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not. &l4&rAnd when the
    queen of Sheba had seen'
  '36': all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built, &l5&rAnd the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the
  '37': 'Lord; there was no more spirit in her. &l6&rAnd she said to the king, It
    was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
    &l7&rHowbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it:
    and, behold, the half'
  '38': 'was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.
    &l8&rHappy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually
    before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. &l9&rBlessed be the Lord thy God, which
    delighted in thee, to'
  '39': 'set thee on the throne of Israel: because the Lord loved Israel for ever,
    therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice. &l10&rAnd she gave the
    king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and
    precious stones: there'
  '40': came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. &l11&rAnd the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones. &l12&rAnd the king made of
  '41': 'the almug trees pillars for the house of the Lord, and for the king''s house,
    harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were
    seen unto this day. &l13&rAnd king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her
    desire, whatsoever'
  '42': she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants. &l14&rNow the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
  '43': '&l15&rBeside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice
    merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
    &l16&rAnd king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels
    of gold went'
  '44': 'to one target. &l17&rAnd he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three
    pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest
    of Lebanon. &l18&rMoreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
    it with the best'
  '45': 'gold. &l19&rThe throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
    behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two
    lions stood beside the stays. &l20&rAnd twelve lions stood there on the one side
    and on the other upon'
  '46': 'the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. &l21&rAnd all
    king Solomon''s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house
    of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing
    accounted of in the days'
  '47': 'of Solomon. &l22&rFor the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy
    of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver,
    ivory, and apes, and peacocks. &l23&rSo king Solomon exceeded all the kings of
    the earth for'
  '48': riches and for wisdom. &l24&rAnd all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. &l25&rAnd they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and
  '49': 'mules, a rate year by year. &l26&rAnd Solomon gathered together chariots
    and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
    horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
    &l27&rAnd the'
  '50': 'king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as
    the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance. &l28&rAnd Solomon had

    But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh,
    women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites: &l2&rOf the
    nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not'

    away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love. &l3&rAnd he
    had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives
    turned away his'

    away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his
    God, as was the heart of David his father. &l5&rFor Solomon went after Ashtoreth
    the goddess of'
  '5': the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. &l6&rAnd Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord, and went not fully after the Lord, as did David his father. &l7&rThen did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of
  '6': Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. &l8&rAnd likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods. &l9&rAnd the Lord was angry with Solomon, because
  '7': 'his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel, which had appeared unto
    him twice, &l10&rAnd had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not
    go after other gods: but he kept not that which the Lord commanded. &l11&rWherefore
    the Lord said'
  '8': unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. &l12&rNotwithstanding in thy days I will not do it
  '9': 'for David thy father''s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
    &l13&rHowbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to
    thy son for David my servant''s sake, and for Jerusalem''s sake which I have chosen.
    &l14&rAnd the Lord'
  '10': 'stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king''s
    seed in Edom. &l15&rFor it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
    captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every
    male in Edom;'
  '11': '&l16&r(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had
    cut off every male in Edom:) &l17&rThat Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of
    his father''s servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.
    &l18&rAnd they arose'
  '12': 'out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran,
    and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and
    appointed him victuals, and gave him land. &l19&rAnd Hadad found great favour
    in the sight of'
  '13': 'Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister
    of Tahpenes the queen. &l20&rAnd the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his
    son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh''s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh''s
    household among the sons'
  '14': of Pharaoh. &l21&rAnd when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country. &l22&rThen Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou
  '15': 'lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And
    he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise. &l23&rAnd God stirred him
    up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer
    king of Zobah:'
  '16': '&l24&rAnd he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when
    David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned
    in Damascus. &l25&rAnd he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
    beside the mischief'
  '17': 'that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria. &l26&rAnd
    Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon''s servant, whose
    mother''s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the
    king. &l27&rAnd this was'
  '18': 'the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo,
    and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father. &l28&rAnd the man Jeroboam
    was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious,
    he made'
  '19': him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph. &l29&rAnd it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were
  '20': 'alone in the field: &l30&rAnd Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him,
    and rent it in twelve pieces: &l31&rAnd he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces:
    for thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out
    of the hand of'
  '21': 'Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee: &l32&r(But he shall have one tribe
    for my servant David''s sake, and for Jerusalem''s sake, the city which I have
    chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:) &l33&rBecause that they have forsaken
    me, and have'
  '22': worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David
  '23': 'his father. &l34&rHowbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand:
    but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant''s sake,
    whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: &l35&rBut I will
    take the kingdom'
  '24': out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes. &l36&rAnd unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there. &l37&rAnd I will
  '25': take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. &l38&rAnd it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my
  '26': statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee. &l39&rAnd I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever. &l40&rSolomon sought
  '27': therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. &l41&rAnd the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book
  '28': 'of the acts of Solomon? &l42&rAnd the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem
    over all Israel was forty years. &l43&rAnd Solomon slept with his fathers, and
    was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
    stead.'
  '29': 'Chapter 12

    And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him
    king. &l2&rAnd it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in
    Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam'
  '30': 'dwelt in Egypt;) &l3&rThat they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all
    the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, &l4&rThy father
    made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father,
    and his heavy'
  '31': yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. &l5&rAnd he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed. &l6&rAnd king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while
  '32': he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? &l7&rAnd they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy
  '33': 'servants for ever. &l8&rBut he forsook the counsel of the old men, which
    they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him,
    and which stood before him: &l9&rAnd he said unto them, What counsel give ye that
    we may answer this'
  '34': people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter? &l10&rAnd the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made
  '35': 'our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto
    them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father''s loins. &l11&rAnd now
    whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my
    father hath chastised you'
  '36': with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. &l12&rSo Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day. &l13&rAnd the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old
  '37': 'men''s counsel that they gave him; &l14&rAnd spake to them after the counsel
    of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your
    yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'
  '38': '&l15&rWherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was
    from the Lord, that he might perform his saying, which the Lord spake by Ahijah
    the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat. &l16&rSo when all Israel saw that
    the king hearkened not'
  '39': 'unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in
    David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel:
    now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents. &l17&rBut
    as for the children'
  '40': of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. &l18&rThen king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot,
  '41': 'to flee to Jerusalem. &l19&rSo Israel rebelled against the house of David
    unto this day. &l20&rAnd it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam
    was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made
    him king over all Israel:'
  '42': there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. &l21&rAnd when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors,
  '43': to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. &l22&rBut the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying, &l23&rSpeak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of
  '44': 'Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, &l24&rThus
    saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children
    of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened
    therefore to the'
  '45': word of the Lord, and returned to depart, according to the word of the Lord. &l25&rThen Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel. &l26&rAnd Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom
  '46': 'return to the house of David: &l27&rIf this people go up to do sacrifice
    in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn
    again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me,
    and go again to'
  '47': 'Rehoboam king of Judah. &l28&rWhereupon the king took counsel, and made two
    calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:
    behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. &l29&rAnd
    he set the'
  '48': 'one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. &l30&rAnd this thing became a
    sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan. &l31&rAnd he
    made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which
    were not of the sons'
  '49': 'of Levi. &l32&rAnd Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
    fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered
    upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made:
    and he placed in'

    And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto
    Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense. &l2&rAnd he cried against
    the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord;'
  '3': Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee. &l3&rAnd he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is
  '4': the sign which the Lord hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out. &l4&rAnd it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he
  '5': put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him. &l5&rThe altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign
  '6': which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord. &l6&rAnd the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the Lord, and the
  '7': king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before. &l7&rAnd the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward. &l8&rAnd the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine
  '8': 'house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water
    in this place: &l9&rFor so was it charged me by the word of the Lord, saying,
    Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.
    &l10&rSo he went'
  '9': 'another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel. &l11&rNow
    there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works
    that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken
    unto the king, them'
  '10': 'they told also to their father. &l12&rAnd their father said unto them, What
    way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from
    Judah. &l13&rAnd he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him
    the ass: and he rode'
  '11': 'thereon, &l14&rAnd went after the man of God, and found him sitting under
    an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?
    And he said, I am. &l15&rThen he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
    &l16&rAnd he said, I'
  '12': 'may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor
    drink water with thee in this place: &l17&rFor it was said to me by the word of
    the Lord, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go
    by the way that thou'
  '13': camest. &l18&rHe said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him. &l19&rSo he went back with
  '14': 'him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water. &l20&rAnd it came to
    pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the Lord came unto the prophet
    that brought him back: &l21&rAnd he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah,
    saying, Thus'
  '15': saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee, &l22&rBut camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to
  '16': thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers. &l23&rAnd it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought
  '17': 'back. &l24&rAnd when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
    and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood
    by the carcase. &l25&rAnd, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in
    the way, and the lion'
  '18': 'standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the
    old prophet dwelt. &l26&rAnd when the prophet that brought him back from the way
    heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word
    of the Lord: therefore'
  '19': the Lord hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake unto him. &l27&rAnd he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him. &l28&rAnd he went and found his
  '20': 'carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase:
    the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass. &l29&rAnd the prophet took
    up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back:
    and the old prophet'
  '21': came to the city, to mourn and to bury him. &l30&rAnd he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother! &l31&rAnd it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then
  '22': 'bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside
    his bones: &l32&rFor the saying which he cried by the word of the Lord against
    the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in
    the cities of'
  '23': 'Samaria, shall surely come to pass. &l33&rAfter this thing Jeroboam returned
    not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the
    high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests
    of the high'
  '24': places. &l34&rAnd this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.
  '25': 'Chapter 14

    At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. &l2&rAnd Jeroboam said to his
    wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the
    wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet,'
  '26': 'which told me that I should be king over this people. &l3&rAnd take with
    thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall
    tell thee what shall become of the child. &l4&rAnd Jeroboam''s wife did so, and
    arose, and went to Shiloh,'
  '27': 'and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were
    set by reason of his age. &l5&rAnd the Lord said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife
    of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and
    thus shalt thou say'
  '28': 'unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself
    to be another woman. &l6&rAnd it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet,
    as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why
    feignest thou'
  '29': thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings. &l7&rGo, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel, &l8&rAnd rent the kingdom away from
  '30': 'the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant
    David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do
    that only which was right in mine eyes; &l9&rBut hast done evil above all that
    were before thee:'
  '31': 'for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke
    me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: &l10&rTherefore, behold, I will
    bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that
    pisseth against the'
  '32': wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone. &l11&rHim that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field
  '33': 'shall the fowls of the air eat: for the Lord hath spoken it. &l12&rArise
    thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the
    city, the child shall die. &l13&rAnd all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury
    him: for he only of'
  '34': 'Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good
    thing toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. &l14&rMoreover the
    Lord shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam
    that day: but'
  '35': what? even now. &l15&rFor the Lord shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves,
  '36': 'provoking the Lord to anger. &l16&rAnd he shall give Israel up because of
    the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin. &l17&rAnd Jeroboam''s
    wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold
    of the door, the'
  '37': child died; &l18&rAnd they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. &l19&rAnd the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold,
  '38': 'they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. &l20&rAnd
    the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his
    fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead. &l21&rAnd Rehoboam the son of
    Solomon reigned'
  '39': in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
  '40': '&l22&rAnd Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they provoked him
    to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers
    had done. &l23&rFor they also built them high places, and images, and groves,
    on every high hill,'
  '41': 'and under every green tree. &l24&rAnd there were also sodomites in the land:
    and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast
    out before the children of Israel. &l25&rAnd it came to pass in the fifth year
    of king Rehoboam,'
  '42': 'that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: &l26&rAnd he took away
    the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king''s house;
    he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon
    had made. &l27&rAnd'
  '43': king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house. &l28&rAnd it was so, when the king went into the house of the Lord, that the guard bare them, and
  '44': brought them back into the guard chamber. &l29&rNow the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? &l30&rAnd there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.

    in the eyes of the Lord, as did David his father. &l12&rAnd he took away the'

  '22': two years. &l9&rAnd his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah. &l10&rAnd Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the

  '27': 'slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host,
    king over Israel that day in the camp. &l17&rAnd Omri went up from Gibbethon,
    and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. &l18&rAnd it came to pass,
    when Zimri saw that the'

  '30': 'followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
    &l22&rBut the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed
    Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. &l23&rIn the thirty

    of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built,
    after the name'

    twenty and two years.'

    for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife
    Jezebel the daughter'
  '36': of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him. &l32&rAnd he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. &l33&rAnd Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel
  '37': 'to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him. &l34&rIn his
    days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram

  '41': 'according unto the word of the Lord: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith,
    that is before Jordan. &l6&rAnd the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the
    morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. &l7&rAnd
    it came to pass'
  '42': 'after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in
    the land. &l8&rAnd the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, &l9&rArise, get
    thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded
    a widow woman'
  '43': 'there to sustain thee. &l10&rSo he arose and went to Zarephath. And when
    he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of
    sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water
    in a vessel, that I may'
  '44': drink. &l11&rAnd as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. &l12&rAnd she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a
  '45': 'cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress
    it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. &l13&rAnd Elijah said unto
    her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake
    first, and bring it unto'
  '46': me, and after make for thee and for thy son. &l14&rFor thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. &l15&rAnd she went and did according
  '47': 'to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.
    &l16&rAnd the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according
    to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah. &l17&rAnd it came to pass after
    these'
  '48': things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. &l18&rAnd she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my
  '49': sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? &l19&rAnd he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. &l20&rAnd he cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God,
  '50': hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? &l21&rAnd he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.

    &l22&rAnd the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into
    him again, and he revived. &l23&rAnd Elijah took the child, and brought him down
    out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and'

  '3': 'Chapter 18

    And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to Elijah
    in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon
    the earth. &l2&rAnd Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore
    famine'
  '4': 'in Samaria. &l3&rAnd Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
    (Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly: &l4&rFor it was so, when Jezebel cut off
    the prophets of the Lord, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them
    by fifty in a cave,'
  '5': 'and fed them with bread and water.) &l5&rAnd Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into
    the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may
    find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
    &l6&rSo they'
  '6': 'divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by
    himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. &l7&rAnd as Obadiah was in the
    way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said,
    Art thou that my lord'
  '7': 'Elijah? &l8&rAnd he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah
    is here. &l9&rAnd he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy
    servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? &l10&rAs the Lord thy God liveth, there
    is no nation or'
  '8': 'kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He
    is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee
    not. &l11&rAnd now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here. &l12&rAnd
    it shall come to'
  '9': 'pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry
    thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find
    thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth. &l13&rWas
    it not told my lord'
  '10': 'what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord, how I hid an hundred
    men of the Lord''s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
    &l14&rAnd now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall
    slay me.'
  '11': '&l15&rAnd Elijah said, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand,
    I will surely shew myself unto him to day. &l16&rSo Obadiah went to meet Ahab,
    and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah. &l17&rAnd it came to pass, when Ahab
    saw Elijah, that Ahab'
  '12': said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel? &l18&rAnd he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim. &l19&rNow therefore send, and
  '13': gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table. &l20&rSo Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together
  '14': 'unto mount Carmel. &l21&rAnd Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How
    long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal,
    then follow him. And the people answered him not a word. &l22&rThen said Elijah
    unto the people, I,'
  '15': 'even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal''s prophets are four
    hundred and fifty men. &l23&rLet them therefore give us two bullocks; and let
    them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood,
    and put no fire under:'
  '16': 'and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:
    &l24&rAnd call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the
    Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered
    and said, It'
  '17': is well spoken. &l25&rAnd Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under. &l26&rAnd they took the bullock which was given them, and
  '18': they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. &l27&rAnd it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them,
  '19': 'and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing,
    or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. &l28&rAnd
    they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets,
    till the blood'
  '20': gushed out upon them. &l29&rAnd it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. &l30&rAnd Elijah said unto all the
  '21': people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. &l31&rAnd Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord
  '22': 'came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: &l32&rAnd with the stones he built
    an altar in the name of the Lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great
    as would contain two measures of seed. &l33&rAnd he put the wood in order, and
    cut the bullock in'
  '23': pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. &l34&rAnd he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the
  '24': third time. &l35&rAnd the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. &l36&rAnd it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac,
  '25': and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. &l37&rHear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast
  '26': turned their heart back again. &l38&rThen the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. &l39&rAnd when all the people saw it, they fell on their
  '27': 'faces: and they said, The Lord, he is the God; the Lord, he is the God. &l40&rAnd
    Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.
    And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew
    them there.'
  '28': '&l41&rAnd Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is
    a sound of abundance of rain. &l42&rSo Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah
    went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put
    his face between'
  '29': his knees, &l43&rAnd said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. &l44&rAnd it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little
  '30': cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down that the rain stop thee not. &l45&rAnd it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a
  '31': great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. &l46&rAnd the hand of the Lord was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
  '32': 'Chapter 19

    And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all
    the prophets with the sword. &l2&rThen Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying,
    So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of'
  '33': one of them by to morrow about this time. &l3&rAnd when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there. &l4&rBut he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and
  '34': 'sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might
    die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better
    than my fathers. &l5&rAnd as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then
    an angel touched'
  '35': him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. &l6&rAnd he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. &l7&rAnd the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and
  '36': touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee. &l8&rAnd he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God. &l9&rAnd he came thither unto a cave,
  '37': 'and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said
    unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? &l10&rAnd he said, I have been very jealous
    for the Lord God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
    thrown down'
  '38': thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. &l11&rAnd he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind
  '39': 'rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the
    Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not
    in the earthquake: &l12&rAnd after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not
    in the fire: and'
  '40': after the fire a still small voice. &l13&rAnd it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
  '41': ' &l14&rAnd he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: because
    the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and
    slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek
    my life, to take'
  '42': 'it away. &l15&rAnd the Lord said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness
    of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria: &l16&rAnd
    Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the
    son of'
  '43': 'Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. &l17&rAnd
    it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay:
    and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. &l18&rYet I have
    left me seven'
  '44': 'thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every
    mouth which hath not kissed him. &l19&rSo he departed thence, and found Elisha
    the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he
    with the twelfth: and'
  '45': 'Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him. &l20&rAnd he left the
    oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and
    my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for
    what have I done to'
  '46': thee? &l21&rAnd he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.
  '47': 'Chapter 20

    And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were
    thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged
    Samaria, and warred against it. &l2&rAnd he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel'
  '48': into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad, &l3&rThy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine. &l4&rAnd the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine,
  '49': and all that I have. &l5&rAnd the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; &l6&rYet I will send my servants
  '50': unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.

    &l7&rThen the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark,
    I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my
    wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him'
  '2': 'not. &l8&rAnd all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not
    unto him, nor consent. &l9&rWherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad,
    Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first
    I will do: but this'
  '3': thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again. &l10&rAnd Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me. &l11&rAnd
  '4': the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off. &l12&rAnd it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he
  '5': said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city. &l13&rAnd, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will
  '6': deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. &l14&rAnd Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the Lord, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered,
  '7': 'Thou. &l15&rThen he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces,
    and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people,
    even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand. &l16&rAnd they went out
    at noon. But'
  '8': Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him. &l17&rAnd the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come
  '9': out of Samaria. &l18&rAnd he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive. &l19&rSo these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.
  '10': '&l20&rAnd they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued
    them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen. &l21&rAnd
    the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians
    with'
  '11': 'a great slaughter. &l22&rAnd the prophet came to the king of Israel, and
    said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for
    at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee. &l23&rAnd
    the servants of the king'
  '12': of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. &l24&rAnd do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place,
  '13': 'and put captains in their rooms: &l25&rAnd number thee an army, like the
    army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will
    fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And
    he hearkened unto their'
  '14': 'voice, and did so. &l26&rAnd it came to pass at the return of the year, that
    Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
    &l27&rAnd the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went
    against them: and the'
  '15': children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country. &l28&rAnd there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the Lord, Because the Syrians have said, The Lord is God
  '16': of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the Lord. &l29&rAnd they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day
  '17': 'the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an
    hundred thousand footmen in one day. &l30&rBut the rest fled to Aphek, into the
    city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were
    left. And Benhadad'
  '18': 'fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber. &l31&rAnd his servants
    said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel
    are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes
    upon our heads, and go'
  '19': 'out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life. &l32&rSo they
    girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the
    king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live.
    And he said, Is he'
  '20': 'yet alive? he is my brother. &l33&rNow the men did diligently observe whether
    any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother
    Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and
    he caused him'
  '21': to come up into the chariot. &l34&rAnd Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with
  '22': this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away. &l35&rAnd a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the Lord, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him. &l36&rThen said he unto him,
  '23': Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the Lord, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him. &l37&rThen he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray
  '24': 'thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him. &l38&rSo
    the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself
    with ashes upon his face. &l39&rAnd as the king passed by, he cried unto the king:
    and he said, Thy'
  '25': 'servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned
    aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he
    be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent
    of silver. &l40&rAnd as'
  '26': thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it. &l41&rAnd he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the
  '27': prophets. &l42&rAnd he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people. &l43&rAnd the king of Israel went to
  '28': his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.
  '29': 'Chapter 21

    And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard,
    which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. &l2&rAnd Ahab
    spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden'
  '30': 'of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a
    better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth
    of it in money. &l3&rAnd Naboth said to Ahab, The Lord forbid it me, that I should
    give the'
  '31': 'inheritance of my fathers unto thee. &l4&rAnd Ahab came into his house heavy
    and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him:
    for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid
    him down upon'
  '32': his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. &l5&rBut Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? &l6&rAnd he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto
  '33': 'him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give
    thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
    &l7&rAnd Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel?
    arise, and'
  '34': 'eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of
    Naboth the Jezreelite. &l8&rSo she wrote letters in Ahab''s name, and sealed them
    with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were
    in his city, dwelling'
  '35': 'with Naboth. &l9&rAnd she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast,
    and set Naboth on high among the people: &l10&rAnd set two men, sons of Belial,
    before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and
    the king. And then carry'
  '36': him out, and stone him, that he may die. &l11&rAnd the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them. &l12&rThey
  '37': 'proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. &l13&rAnd there
    came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial
    witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying,
    Naboth did'
  '38': blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. &l14&rThen they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead. &l15&rAnd it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,
  '39': 'and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard
    of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth
    is not alive, but dead. &l16&rAnd it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth
    was dead, that Ahab'
  '40': 'rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession
    of it. &l17&rAnd the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, &l18&rArise,
    go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the
    vineyard'
  '41': of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it. &l19&rAnd thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, In the place where dogs licked the
  '42': 'blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. &l20&rAnd Ahab said
    to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee:
    because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord. &l21&rBehold,
    I will bring'
  '43': evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, &l22&rAnd will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of
  '44': Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin. &l23&rAnd of Jezebel also spake the Lord, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. &l24&rHim that dieth of Ahab in the city
  '45': the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat. &l25&rBut there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. &l26&rAnd he did very
  '46': abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel. &l27&rAnd it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and
  '47': 'fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. &l28&rAnd the word of the
    Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, &l29&rSeest thou how Ahab humbleth himself
    before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in
    his days: but in'
  '48': his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.

    And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. &l2&rAnd
    it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down
    to the king of Israel. &l3&rAnd the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know
    ye that'

    &l4&rAnd he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead?
    And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy
    people, my horses as thy horses. &l5&rAnd Jehoshaphat said unto the king of'
  '2': Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the Lord to day. &l6&rThen the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for
  '3': the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. &l7&rAnd Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we might enquire of him? &l8&rAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of
  '4': 'Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the Lord: but I hate him; for he doth not
    prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king
    say so. &l9&rThen the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither
    Micaiah the son of'
  '5': Imlah. &l10&rAnd the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. &l11&rAnd Zedekiah the son of
  '6': 'Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the Lord, With these
    shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them. &l12&rAnd all the
    prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the Lord
    shall deliver it'
  '7': 'into the king''s hand. &l13&rAnd the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah
    spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto
    the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of
    them, and speak that'
  '8': which is good. &l14&rAnd Micaiah said, As the Lord liveth, what the Lord saith unto me, that will I speak. &l15&rSo he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered
  '9': 'him, Go, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
    &l16&rAnd the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou
    tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord? &l17&rAnd he said,
    I saw all'
  '10': 'Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the
    Lord said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
    &l18&rAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he
    would prophesy no'
  '11': 'good concerning me, but evil? &l19&rAnd he said, Hear thou therefore the
    word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven
    standing by him on his right hand and on his left. &l20&rAnd the Lord said, Who
    shall persuade Ahab,'
  '12': that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner. &l21&rAnd there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him. &l22&rAnd the Lord said unto him, Wherewith? And he
  '13': 'said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
    prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and
    do so. &l23&rNow therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth
    of all these thy'
  '14': prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee. &l24&rBut Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee? &l25&rAnd Micaiah said, Behold, thou
  '15': shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. &l26&rAnd the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; &l27&rAnd say, Thus saith the king, Put
  '16': this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. &l28&rAnd Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.
  '17': '&l29&rSo the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to
    Ramothgilead. &l30&rAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
    myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of
    Israel disguised'
  '18': himself, and went into the battle. &l31&rBut the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. &l32&rAnd it came to pass, when the
  '19': 'captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the
    king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried
    out. &l33&rAnd it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that
    it was not the'
  '20': 'king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. &l34&rAnd a certain
    man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of
    the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand,
    and carry me out of'
  '21': 'the host; for I am wounded. &l35&rAnd the battle increased that day: and
    the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and
    the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot. &l36&rAnd there
    went a proclamation'
  '22': throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country. &l37&rSo the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. &l38&rAnd one washed the chariot in the pool of
  '23': Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the Lord which he spake. &l39&rNow the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are
  '24': they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? &l40&rSo Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. &l41&rAnd Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
  '25': ' &l42&rJehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign;
    and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother''s name was
    Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. &l43&rAnd he walked in all the ways of Asa his
    father; he turned not aside'
  '26': 'from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord: nevertheless
    the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense
    yet in the high places. &l44&rAnd Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
    &l45&rNow the rest of'
  '27': the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? &l46&rAnd the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the
  '28': 'land. &l47&rThere was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king. &l48&rJehoshaphat
    made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships
    were broken at Eziongeber. &l49&rThen said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat,
    Let my'
  '29': 'servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not. &l50&rAnd
    Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city
    of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. &l51&rAhaziah the
    son of Ahab'
  '30': began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. &l52&rAnd he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of
  '31': 'Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: &l53&rFor he served Baal,
    and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the Lord God of Israel, according to
    all that his father had done.'
