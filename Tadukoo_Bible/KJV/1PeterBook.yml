  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus,
    Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, &l2&rElect according to the foreknowledge
    of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and'
  '2': 'sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
    &l3&rBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
    his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection
    of Jesus'
  '3': Christ from the dead, &l4&rTo an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, &l5&rWho are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. &l6&rWherein ye
  '4': 'greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness
    through manifold temptations: &l7&rThat the trial of your faith, being much more
    precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found
    unto praise and'
  '5': 'honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: &l8&rWhom having not seen,
    ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy
    unspeakable and full of glory: &l9&rReceiving the end of your faith, even the
    salvation of your'
  '6': 'souls. &l10&rOf which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently,
    who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: &l11&rSearching what, or
    what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it
    testified'
  '7': beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. &l12&rUnto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with
  '8': the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into. &l13&rWherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; &l14&rAs
  '9': 'obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts
    in your ignorance: &l15&rBut as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy
    in all manner of conversation; &l16&rBecause it is written, Be ye holy; for I
    am holy. &l17&rAnd if'
  '10': 'ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to
    every man''s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: &l18&rForasmuch
    as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold,
    from your vain'
  '11': 'conversation received by tradition from your fathers; &l19&rBut with the
    precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: &l20&rWho
    verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in
    these last times for'
  '12': you, &l21&rWho by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. &l22&rSeeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren,
  '13': 'see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: &l23&rBeing born
    again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which
    liveth and abideth for ever. &l24&rFor all flesh is as grass, and all the glory
    of man as the flower'
  '14': 'of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: &l25&rBut
    the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel
    is preached unto you.'
  '15': 'Chapter 2

    Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies,
    and all evil speakings, &l2&rAs newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the
    word, that ye may grow thereby: &l3&rIf so be ye have tasted that the Lord is
    gracious.'
  '16': '&l4&rTo whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but
    chosen of God, and precious, &l5&rYe also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual
    house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God
    by Jesus Christ.'
  '17': ' &l6&rWherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion
    a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not
    be confounded. &l7&rUnto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto
    them which be'
  '18': 'disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the
    head of the corner, &l8&rAnd a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even
    to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were
    appointed. &l9&rBut ye'
  '19': are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; &l10&rWhich in time past were not a people, but are now the people
  '20': 'of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. &l11&rDearly
    beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts,
    which war against the soul; &l12&rHaving your conversation honest among the Gentiles:
    that,'
  '21': 'whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works,
    which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. &l13&rSubmit yourselves
    to every ordinance of man for the Lord''s sake: whether it be to the king, as
    supreme; &l14&rOr'
  '22': 'unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers,
    and for the praise of them that do well. &l15&rFor so is the will of God, that
    with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: &l16&rAs free,
    and not'
  '23': using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. &l17&rHonour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. &l18&rServants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the
  '24': froward. &l19&rFor this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. &l20&rFor what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye
  '25': 'take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. &l21&rFor even hereunto were
    ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye
    should follow his steps: &l22&rWho did no sin, neither was guile found in his
    mouth: &l23&rWho, when'
  '26': 'he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but
    committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: &l24&rWho his own self bare
    our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live
    unto righteousness: by'
  '27': whose stripes ye were healed. &l25&rFor ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
  '28': 'Chapter 3

    Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not
    the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;
    &l2&rWhile they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. &l3&rWhose'
  '29': adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; &l4&rBut let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is
  '30': 'in the sight of God of great price. &l5&rFor after this manner in the old
    time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection
    unto their own husbands: &l6&rEven as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose
    daughters ye'
  '31': are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. &l7&rLikewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your
  '32': 'prayers be not hindered. &l8&rFinally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion
    one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: &l9&rNot rendering
    evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that
    ye are thereunto'
  '33': 'called, that ye should inherit a blessing. &l10&rFor he that will love life,
    and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they
    speak no guile: &l11&rLet him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and
    ensue it. &l12&rFor'
  '34': 'the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their
    prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. &l13&rAnd who
    is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? &l14&rBut
    and if ye suffer for'
  '35': 'righteousness'' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither
    be troubled; &l15&rBut sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always
    to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in
    you with meekness'
  '36': 'and fear: &l16&rHaving a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of
    you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation
    in Christ. &l17&rFor it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
    well doing, than'
  '37': 'for evil doing. &l18&rFor Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just
    for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh,
    but quickened by the Spirit: &l19&rBy which also he went and preached unto the
    spirits in prison;'
  '38': '&l20&rWhich sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God
    waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is,
    eight souls were saved by water. &l21&rThe like figure whereunto even baptism
    doth also now save us'
  '39': '(not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
    conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: &l22&rWho is gone
    into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers
    being made subject unto'
  '40': him.
  '41': 'Chapter 4

    Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise
    with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
    &l2&rThat he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts'
  '42': 'of men, but to the will of God. &l3&rFor the time past of our life may suffice
    us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,
    lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: &l4&rWherein
    they think'
  '43': 'it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking
    evil of you: &l5&rWho shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick
    and the dead. &l6&rFor for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that
    are dead, that they'
  '44': 'might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God
    in the spirit. &l7&rBut the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,
    and watch unto prayer. &l8&rAnd above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:
    for charity'
  '45': shall cover the multitude of sins. &l9&rUse hospitality one to another without grudging. &l10&rAs every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. &l11&rIf any man speak, let him
  '46': 'speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the
    ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus
    Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. &l12&rBeloved,
    think it not strange'
  '47': 'concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing
    happened unto you: &l13&rBut rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ''s
    sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding
    joy. &l14&rIf'
  '48': 'ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of
    glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on
    your part he is glorified. &l15&rBut let none of you suffer as a murderer, or
    as a thief, or as an'
  '49': 'evildoer, or as a busybody in other men''s matters. &l16&rYet if any man
    suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this
    behalf. &l17&rFor the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God:
    and if it first begin at'
  '50': us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? &l18&rAnd if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?

    The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of
    the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
    &l2&rFeed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not
    by'
  '3': constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; &l3&rNeither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock. &l4&rAnd when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
  '4': '&l5&rLikewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you
    be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the
    proud, and giveth grace to the humble. &l6&rHumble yourselves therefore under
    the mighty hand of'

    devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: &l9&rWhom
    resist stedfast in the'

  '7': strengthen, settle you. &l11&rTo him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. &l12&rBy Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
  '8': '&l13&rThe church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you;
