ch1v1: 'Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:'
ch1v2: 'And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.'
ch1v3: And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there.
ch1v4: 'And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:'
ch1v5: 'But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut up her womb.'
ch1v6: And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the Lord had shut up her womb.
ch1v7: And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
ch1v8: Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?
ch1v9: So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord.
ch1v10: And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept sore.
ch1v11: And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
ch1v12: And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli marked her mouth.
ch1v13: 'Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.'
ch1v14: And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
ch1v15: 'And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord.'
ch1v16: 'Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.'
ch1v17: 'Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.'
ch1v18: And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.
ch1v19: 'And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.'
ch1v20: Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the Lord.
ch1v21: And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
ch1v22: But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord, and there abide for ever.
ch1v23: And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the Lord establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
ch1v24: 'And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh: and the child was young.'
ch1v25: And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
ch1v26: And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord.
ch1v27: 'For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him:'
ch1v28: Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord. And he worshipped the Lord there.

ch2v1: 'And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the Lord, mine horn is exalted in the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.'
ch2v2: 'There is none holy as the Lord: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.'
ch2v3: 'Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.'
ch2v4: The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
ch2v5: 'They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.'
ch2v6: 'The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.'
ch2v7: 'The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.'
ch2v8: 'He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord''s, and he hath set the world upon them.'
ch2v9: He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
ch2v10: 'The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.'
ch2v11: And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the Lord before Eli the priest.
ch2v12: Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the Lord.
ch2v13: And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
ch2v14: And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
ch2v15: Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
ch2v16: 'And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.'
ch2v17: 'Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord: for men abhorred the offering of the Lord.'
ch2v18: But Samuel ministered before the Lord, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
ch2v19: Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
ch2v20: And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The Lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the Lord. And they went unto their own home.
ch2v21: And the Lord visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.
ch2v22: Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
ch2v23: And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
ch2v24: 'Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the Lord''s people to transgress.'
ch2v25: 'If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them.'
ch2v26: And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men.
ch2v27: And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
ch2v28: And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
ch2v29: Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
ch2v30: 'Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.'
ch2v31: Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.
ch2v32: 'And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.'
ch2v33: 'And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.'
ch2v34: And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
ch2v35: 'And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.'
ch2v36: And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

ch3v1: And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli. And the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
ch3v2: And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
ch3v3: And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;
ch3v4: 'That the Lord called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.'
ch3v5: And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
ch3v6: And the Lord called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
ch3v7: Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him.
ch3v8: And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child.
ch3v9: 'Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.'
ch3v10: And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
ch3v11: And the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
ch3v12: 'In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.'
ch3v13: For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
ch3v14: And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
ch3v15: And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
ch3v16: Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.
ch3v17: 'And he said, What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.'
ch3v18: 'And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good.'
ch3v19: And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
ch3v20: And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.
ch3v21: 'And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh: for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.'

ch4v1: 'And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.'
ch4v2: 'And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.'
ch4v3: And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
ch4v4: 'So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.'
ch4v5: And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
ch4v6: And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.
ch4v7: And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
ch4v8: Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
ch4v9: 'Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.'
ch4v10: 'And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.'
ch4v11: And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
ch4v12: And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
ch4v13: 'And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.'
ch4v14: And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
ch4v15: Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.
ch4v16: And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?
ch4v17: And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
ch4v18: 'And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.'
ch4v19: 'And his daughter in law, Phinehas'' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.'
ch4v20: And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
ch4v21: 'And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.'
ch4v22: 'And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.'

ch5v1: And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.
ch5v2: When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
ch5v3: And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
ch5v4: And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.
ch5v5: Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.
ch5v6: But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.
ch5v7: 'And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.'
ch5v8: They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.
ch5v9: 'And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.'
ch5v10: Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
ch5v11: 'So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.'
ch5v12: 'And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.'

ch6v1: And the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
ch6v2: And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the Lord? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.
ch6v3: 'And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.'
ch6v4: 'Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.'
ch6v5: 'Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.'
ch6v6: Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
ch6v7: 'Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:'
ch6v8: And take the ark of the Lord, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.
ch6v9: 'And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.'
ch6v10: 'And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:'
ch6v11: And they laid the ark of the Lord upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
ch6v12: And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.
ch6v13: 'And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.'
ch6v14: 'And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the Lord.'
ch6v15: 'And the Levites took down the ark of the Lord, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the Lord.'
ch6v16: And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
ch6v17: And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the Lord; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
ch6v18: 'And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the Lord: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.'
ch6v19: 'And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.'
ch6v20: And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God? and to whom shall he go up from us?
ch6v21: And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the Lord; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.

ch8v1: And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
ch8v2: 'Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.'
ch8v3: And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
ch8v4: Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,
ch8v5: 'And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.'

ch9v1: Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.
ch9v2: 'And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.'
ch9v3: And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
ch9v4: 'And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.'
ch9v5: And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.
ch9v6: 'And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.'
ch9v7: 'Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?'
ch9v8: 'And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.'
ch9v9: '(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)'
ch9v10: Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.
ch9v11: And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?
ch9v12: 'And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:'
ch9v13: 'As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.'
ch9v14: 'And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.'
ch9v15: Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
ch9v16: 'To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.'
ch9v17: And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.
ch9v18: Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.
ch9v19: 'And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.'
ch9v20: And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
ch9v21: And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
ch9v22: And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.
ch9v23: And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
ch9v24: 'And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.'
ch9v25: And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
ch9v26: 'And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.'
ch9v27: And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

ch11v7: And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen.

ch13v11: And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
ch13v12: 'Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the Lord: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.'
ch13v13: 'And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.'

ch14v1: Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.
ch14v2: 'And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;'
ch14v3: And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
ch14v4: 'And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines'' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.'
ch14v5: The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
ch14v6: 'And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.'
ch14v7: 'And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.'
ch14v8: Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.
ch14v9: If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
ch14v10: 'But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.'
ch14v11: 'And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.'
ch14v12: 'And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the Lord hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.'
ch14v13: 'And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.'
ch14v14: And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
ch14v15: 'And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.'
ch14v16: And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
ch14v17: Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.
ch14v18: And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
ch14v19: 'And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.'
ch14v20: 'And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man''s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.'
ch14v21: Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
ch14v22: Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
ch14v23: 'So the Lord saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.'
ch14v24: 'And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.'
ch14v25: And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
ch14v26: 'And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.'
ch14v27: 'But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.'

ch14v29: 'Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.'
ch14v30: How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?

ch14v45: 'And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.'

ch15v1: 'Samuel also said unto Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord.'
ch15v2: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
ch15v3: Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
ch15v4: And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
ch15v5: And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
ch15v6: 'And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.'
ch15v7: And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.
ch15v8: And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
ch15v9: 'But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.'
ch15v10: Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying,
ch15v11: 'It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the Lord all night.'
ch15v12: And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
ch15v13: 'And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the Lord.'
ch15v14: And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
ch15v15: 'And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.'
ch15v16: Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.
ch15v17: And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee king over Israel?
ch15v18: And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
ch15v19: Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord?
ch15v20: And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
ch15v21: But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.
ch15v22: And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
ch15v23: For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.
ch15v24: 'And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.'
ch15v25: Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord.
ch15v26: 'And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.'
ch15v27: And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
ch15v28: And Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.
ch15v29: 'And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.'
ch15v30: 'Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord thy God.'
ch15v31: So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the Lord.
ch15v32: Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
ch15v33: And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.
ch15v34: Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
ch15v35: 'And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.'

ch16v1: 'And the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.'

ch16v6: And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed is before him.
ch16v7: 'But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.'
ch16v8: Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.

ch16v11: 'And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.'
ch16v12: 'And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.'
ch16v13: 'Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.'
ch16v14: But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.
ch16v15: And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
ch16v16: 'Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.'
ch16v17: And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
ch16v18: Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the Lord is with him.
ch16v19: Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.
ch16v20: And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
ch16v21: 'And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.'
ch16v22: And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.
ch16v23: 'And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.'

ch17v26: And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?

ch19v3: And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.
ch19v4: 'And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:'
ch19v5: 'For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?'
ch19v6: 'And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the Lord liveth, he shall not be slain.'
ch19v7: And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
ch19v8: 'And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.'
ch19v9: 'And the evil spirit from the Lord was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.'
ch19v10: 'And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul''s presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.'
ch19v11: 'Saul also sent messengers unto David''s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David''s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.'
ch19v12: 'So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.'
ch19v13: And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.
ch19v14: And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.

ch19v24: And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?

ch20v1: And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
ch20v2: 'And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.'
ch20v3: 'And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.'
ch20v4: Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.
ch20v5: 'And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.'
ch20v6: 'If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'
ch20v7: 'If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.'
ch20v8: 'Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?'
ch20v9: 'And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?'
ch20v10: Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
ch20v11: And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
ch20v12: And Jonathan said unto David, O Lord God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;
ch20v13: 'The Lord do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the Lord be with thee, as he hath been with my father.'
ch20v14: 'And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the Lord, that I die not:'
ch20v15: 'But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.'
ch20v16: So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the Lord even require it at the hand of David's enemies.
ch20v17: 'And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.'
ch20v18: 'Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.'
ch20v19: And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
ch20v20: And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
ch20v21: 'And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the Lord liveth.'
ch20v22: 'But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the Lord hath sent thee away.'
ch20v23: And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the Lord be between thee and me for ever.
ch20v24: 'So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.'
ch20v25: 'And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul''s side, and David''s place was empty.'
ch20v26: 'Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.'
ch20v27: 'And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David''s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?'
ch20v28: 'And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:'
ch20v29: 'And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king''s table.'
ch20v30: Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
ch20v31: For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
ch20v32: And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?
ch20v33: 'And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.'
ch20v34: 'So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.'
ch20v35: And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
ch20v36: And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
ch20v37: And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
ch20v38: And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
ch20v39: 'But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.'
ch20v40: And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.
ch20v41: 'And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.'
ch20v42: 'And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.'

ch21v1: 'Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?'
ch21v2: 'And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.'
ch21v3: Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.
ch21v4: And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
ch21v5: And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
ch21v6: 'So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the Lord, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.'
ch21v7: Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the Lord; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.
ch21v8: And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
ch21v9: 'And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.'
ch21v10: And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
ch21v11: And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
ch21v12: And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
ch21v13: And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
ch21v14: 'Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?'
ch21v15: Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?

ch22v1: 'David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father''s house heard it, they went down thither to him.'
ch22v2: 'And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.'
ch22v3: 'And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.'
ch22v4: 'And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.'
ch22v5: And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
ch22v6: When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)
ch22v7: Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
ch22v8: That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
ch22v9: Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
ch22v10: And he enquired of the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
ch22v11: 'Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father''s house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.'
ch22v12: And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
ch22v13: And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
ch22v14: Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?
ch22v15: 'Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.'
ch22v16: And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
ch22v17: 'And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the Lord: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord.'
ch22v18: And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.
ch22v19: And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
ch22v20: And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.

ch23v3: 'And David''s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?'
ch23v4: Then David enquired of the Lord yet again. And the Lord answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

ch23v12: Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the Lord said, They will deliver thee up.

ch24v4: And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.
ch24v5: And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
ch24v6: And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.

ch24v10: 'Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the Lord had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the Lord''s anointed.'
ch24v11: 'Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.'

ch24v16: And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

ch24v18: 'And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.'
ch24v19: For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.
ch24v20: And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.

ch25v10: And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.
ch25v11: Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?
ch25v12: So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.
ch25v13: 'And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.'
ch25v14: But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.
ch25v15: 'But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:'
ch25v16: They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
ch25v17: 'Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.'
ch25v18: Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
ch25v19: And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
ch25v20: And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.
ch25v21: 'Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.'
ch25v22: So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
ch25v23: And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
ch25v24: 'And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.'
ch25v25: 'Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.'
ch25v26: Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the Lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
ch25v27: And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
ch25v28: 'I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the Lord, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.'
ch25v29: 'Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.'
ch25v30: And it shall come to pass, when the Lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;
ch25v31: 'That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.'
ch25v32: 'And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:'
ch25v33: And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
ch25v34: For in very deed, as the Lord God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
ch25v35: So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
ch25v36: 'And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal''s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.'
ch25v37: But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
ch25v38: And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal, that he died.
ch25v39: 'And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the Lord, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.'
ch25v40: And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.
ch25v41: And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
ch25v42: And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
ch25v43: David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
ch25v44: But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

ch26v3: And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
ch26v4: David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.
ch26v5: 'And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.'
ch26v6: Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
ch26v7: 'So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.'
ch26v8: 'Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.'
ch26v9: 'And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord''s anointed, and be guiltless?'
ch26v10: David said furthermore, As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.
ch26v11: 'The Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord''s anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.'
ch26v12: 'So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul''s bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.'
ch26v13: 'Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:'
ch26v14: And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?
ch26v15: And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
ch26v16: This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the Lord liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the Lord's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.
ch26v17: And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
ch26v18: And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?
ch26v19: 'Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the Lord have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the Lord; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other gods.'
ch26v20: 'Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.'
ch26v21: 'Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.'
ch26v22: And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.
ch26v23: The Lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the Lord delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the Lord's anointed.
ch26v24: And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
ch26v25: 'Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.'

ch27v1: 'And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.'

ch28v5: And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.

ch28v9: 'And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?'
ch28v10: And Saul sware to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.'
ch28v16: Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the Lord is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?
ch28v17: 'And the Lord hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:'
ch28v18: Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto thee this day.

ch28v22: Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.

And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?
ch29v4: 'And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?'
ch29v5: Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
ch29v6: 'Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the Lord liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.'
ch29v7: Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
ch29v8: And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
ch29v9: 'And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.'
