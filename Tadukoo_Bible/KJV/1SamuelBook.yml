  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name
    was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of
    Zuph, an Ephrathite: &l2&rAnd he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah,
    and the'
  '2': 'name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
    &l3&rAnd this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto
    the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the
    priests of'
  '3': 'the Lord, were there. &l4&rAnd when the time was that Elkanah offered, he
    gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: &l5&rBut
    unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut
    up her womb.'
  '4': '&l6&rAnd her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because
    the Lord had shut up her womb. &l7&rAnd as he did so year by year, when she went
    up to the house of the Lord, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did
    not eat. &l8&rThen'
  '5': said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons? &l9&rSo Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat
  '6': upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord. &l10&rAnd she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept sore. &l11&rAnd she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and
  '7': remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. &l12&rAnd it came to pass, as she continued praying before
  '8': 'the Lord, that Eli marked her mouth. &l13&rNow Hannah, she spake in her heart;
    only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had
    been drunken. &l14&rAnd Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put
    away thy wine from'
  '9': 'thee. &l15&rAnd Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful
    spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul
    before the Lord. &l16&rCount not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for
    out of the'
  '10': 'abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. &l17&rThen Eli
    answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition
    that thou hast asked of him. &l18&rAnd she said, Let thine handmaid find grace
    in thy sight. So the'
  '11': 'woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. &l19&rAnd
    they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord, and returned,
    and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord
    remembered'
  '12': her. &l20&rWherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the Lord. &l21&rAnd the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer
  '13': unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. &l22&rBut Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord, and there abide for ever. &l23&rAnd
  '14': Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the Lord establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him. &l24&rAnd when she had weaned him, she took him up with her,
  '15': 'with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought
    him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh: and the child was young. &l25&rAnd they
    slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. &l26&rAnd she said, Oh my lord,
    as thy soul'
  '16': 'liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the
    Lord. &l27&rFor this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which
    I asked of him: &l28&rTherefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he
    liveth he shall be'
  '17': lent to the Lord. And he worshipped the Lord there.
  '18': 'Chapter 2

    And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the Lord, mine horn is exalted
    in the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy
    salvation. &l2&rThere is none holy as the Lord: for there is none beside thee:
    neither'
  '19': 'is there any rock like our God. &l3&rTalk no more so exceeding proudly; let
    not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and
    by him actions are weighed. &l4&rThe bows of the mighty men are broken, and they
    that stumbled are'
  '20': 'girded with strength. &l5&rThey that were full have hired out themselves
    for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven;
    and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. &l6&rThe Lord killeth, and maketh
    alive: he bringeth'
  '21': 'down to the grave, and bringeth up. &l7&rThe Lord maketh poor, and maketh
    rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up. &l8&rHe raiseth up the poor out of the
    dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes,
    and to make them inherit'
  '22': 'the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord''s, and he
    hath set the world upon them. &l9&rHe will keep the feet of his saints, and the
    wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. &l10&rThe
    adversaries of the'
  '23': 'Lord shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them:
    the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his
    king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. &l11&rAnd Elkanah went to Ramah to his
    house. And the child'
  '24': did minister unto the Lord before Eli the priest. &l12&rNow the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the Lord. &l13&rAnd the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was
  '25': in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; &l14&rAnd he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
  '26': '&l15&rAlso before they burnt the fat, the priest''s servant came, and said
    to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not
    have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. &l16&rAnd if any man said unto him, Let them
    not fail to burn the'
  '27': 'fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would
    answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by
    force. &l17&rWherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord:
    for men abhorred the'
  '28': offering of the Lord. &l18&rBut Samuel ministered before the Lord, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. &l19&rMoreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly
  '29': sacrifice. &l20&rAnd Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The Lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the Lord. And they went unto their own home. &l21&rAnd the Lord visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons
  '30': and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord. &l22&rNow Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l23&rAnd he said
  '31': 'unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all
    this people. &l24&rNay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make
    the Lord''s people to transgress. &l25&rIf one man sin against another, the judge
    shall judge him: but'
  '32': if a man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them. &l26&rAnd the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men.
  '33': '&l27&rAnd there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith
    the Lord, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in
    Egypt in Pharaoh''s house? &l28&rAnd did I choose him out of all the tribes of
    Israel to be my priest,'
  '34': to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel? &l29&rWherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have
  '35': commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? &l30&rWherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should
  '36': 'walk before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them
    that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
    &l31&rBehold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy
    father''s house,'
  '37': 'that there shall not be an old man in thine house. &l32&rAnd thou shalt see
    an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and
    there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever. &l33&rAnd the man of thine,
    whom I shall not'
  '38': 'cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine
    heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.
    &l34&rAnd this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on
    Hophni and'
  '39': 'Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them. &l35&rAnd I will raise
    me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart
    and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine
    anointed for ever.'
  '40': '&l36&rAnd it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house
    shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and
    shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests'' offices, that I may
    eat a piece of bread.'
  '41': 'Chapter 3

    And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli. And the word of the
    Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision. &l2&rAnd it came to
    pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to
    wax dim,'
  '42': 'that he could not see; &l3&rAnd ere the lamp of God went out in the temple
    of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; &l4&rThat
    the Lord called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I. &l5&rAnd he ran unto Eli,
    and said, Here am'
  '43': I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. &l6&rAnd the Lord called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son;
  '44': lie down again. &l7&rNow Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him. &l8&rAnd the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli
  '45': 'perceived that the Lord had called the child. &l9&rTherefore Eli said unto
    Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak,
    Lord; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. &l10&rAnd
    the Lord came,'
  '46': and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. &l11&rAnd the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
  '47': '&l12&rIn that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken
    concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. &l13&rFor I have
    told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth;
    because his sons made'
  '48': themselves vile, and he restrained them not. &l14&rAnd therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. &l15&rAnd Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of
  '49': 'the house of the Lord. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. &l16&rThen
    Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I. &l17&rAnd
    he said, What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide
    it not from me:'
  '50': 'God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the
    things that he said unto thee. &l18&rAnd Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing
    from him. And he said, It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good.'

    &l19&rAnd Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words
    fall to the ground. &l20&rAnd all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that
    Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord. &l21&rAnd the Lord appeared'
  '2': 'again in Shiloh: for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the
    word of the Lord.'
  '3': 'Chapter 4

    And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines
    to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
    &l2&rAnd the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they'
  '4': 'joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of
    the army in the field about four thousand men. &l3&rAnd when the people were come
    into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us to
    day before the'
  '5': Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies. &l4&rSo the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant
  '6': 'of the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons
    of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. &l5&rAnd
    when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted
    with a great'
  '7': shout, so that the earth rang again. &l6&rAnd when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp. &l7&rAnd
  '8': the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore. &l8&rWoe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote
  '9': 'the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness. &l9&rBe strong and quit
    yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews,
    as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight. &l10&rAnd the Philistines
    fought,'
  '10': 'and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there
    was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
    &l11&rAnd the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas,
    were slain. &l12&rAnd'
  '11': 'there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same
    day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. &l13&rAnd when he came,
    lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the
    ark of God. And when'
  '12': the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. &l14&rAnd when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli. &l15&rNow Eli was ninety and eight years old; and
  '13': his eyes were dim, that he could not see. &l16&rAnd the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son? &l17&rAnd the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the
  '14': Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. &l18&rAnd it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat
  '15': 'backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he
    was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years. &l19&rAnd his
    daughter in law, Phinehas'' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when
    she heard the tidings'
  '16': that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her. &l20&rAnd about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born
  '17': 'a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it. &l21&rAnd she named
    the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark
    of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband. &l22&rAnd
    she said, The glory is'
  '18': 'departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.'
  '19': 'Chapter 5

    And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.
    &l2&rWhen the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house
    of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. &l3&rAnd when they of Ashdod arose early on the'
  '20': morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. &l4&rAnd when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before
  '21': the ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him. &l5&rTherefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold
  '22': of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day. &l6&rBut the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof. &l7&rAnd when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of
  '23': 'the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us,
    and upon Dagon our god. &l8&rThey sent therefore and gathered all the lords of
    the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God
    of Israel? And they'
  '24': answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither. &l9&rAnd it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great
  '25': 'destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and
    they had emerods in their secret parts. &l10&rTherefore they sent the ark of God
    to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites
    cried out, saying,'
  '26': They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people. &l11&rSo they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that
  '27': 'it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout
    all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. &l12&rAnd the men that died
    not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.'
  '28': 'Chapter 6

    And the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven months. &l2&rAnd
    the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we
    do to the ark of the Lord? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.'
  '29': '&l3&rAnd they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it
    not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed,
    and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you. &l4&rThen said
    they, What shall'
  '30': 'be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five
    golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of
    the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords. &l5&rWherefore
    ye shall make images'
  '31': 'of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall
    give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from
    off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land. &l6&rWherefore then do
    ye harden your hearts, as'
  '32': the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed? &l7&rNow therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine
  '33': 'to the cart, and bring their calves home from them: &l8&rAnd take the ark
    of the Lord, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return
    him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away,
    that it may go.'
  '34': '&l9&rAnd see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh,
    then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is
    not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us. &l10&rAnd the
    men did so; and took two'
  '35': 'milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
    &l11&rAnd they laid the ark of the Lord upon the cart, and the coffer with the
    mice of gold and the images of their emerods. &l12&rAnd the kine took the straight
    way to the way of'
  '36': Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh. &l13&rAnd they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat
  '37': 'harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and
    rejoiced to see it. &l14&rAnd the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite,
    and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the
    cart, and offered'
  '38': 'the kine a burnt offering unto the Lord. &l15&rAnd the Levites took down
    the ark of the Lord, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold
    were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt
    offerings and'
  '39': sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the Lord. &l16&rAnd when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day. &l17&rAnd these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the
  '40': Lord; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; &l18&rAnd the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto
  '41': 'the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the Lord: which
    stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite. &l19&rAnd
    he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord,
    even he smote of'
  '42': 'the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented,
    because the Lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter. &l20&rAnd
    the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God? and
    to whom shall'
  '43': he go up from us? &l21&rAnd they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the Lord; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.
  '44': 'Chapter 7

    And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the Lord, and brought
    it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep
    the ark of the Lord. &l2&rAnd it came to pass, while the ark abode in'
  '45': 'Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the
    house of Israel lamented after the Lord. &l3&rAnd Samuel spake unto all the house
    of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put
    away the strange'
  '46': 'gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord,
    and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
    &l4&rThen the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served
    the Lord only. &l5&rAnd'
  '47': Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the Lord. &l6&rAnd they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the Lord, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the Lord. And
  '48': Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh. &l7&rAnd when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were
  '49': afraid of the Philistines. &l8&rAnd the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines. &l9&rAnd Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering
  '50': 'wholly unto the Lord: and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel; and the
    Lord heard him.'

    &l10&rAnd as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near
    to battle against Israel: but the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that
    day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before'
  '2': Israel. &l11&rAnd the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar. &l12&rThen Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto
  '3': 'hath the Lord helped us. &l13&rSo the Philistines were subdued, and they came
    no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines
    all the days of Samuel. &l14&rAnd the cities which the Philistines had taken from
    Israel'
  '4': were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. &l15&rAnd Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. &l16&rAnd he
  '5': went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places. &l17&rAnd his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the Lord.
  '6': 'Chapter 8

    And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
    &l2&rNow the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah:
    they were judges in Beersheba. &l3&rAnd his sons walked not in his ways, but'
  '7': 'turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. &l4&rThen
    all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto
    Ramah, &l5&rAnd said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in
    thy ways: now make us'
  '8': a king to judge us like all the nations. &l6&rBut the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. &l7&rAnd the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto
  '9': 'thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should
    not reign over them. &l8&rAccording to all the works which they have done since
    the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they
    have forsaken me,'
  '10': 'and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. &l9&rNow therefore hearken
    unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner
    of the king that shall reign over them. &l10&rAnd Samuel told all the words of
    the Lord unto the'
  '11': 'people that asked of him a king. &l11&rAnd he said, This will be the manner
    of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them
    for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before
    his chariots.'
  '12': '&l12&rAnd he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over
    fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to
    make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. &l13&rAnd he will
    take your daughters to be'
  '13': confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. &l14&rAnd he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. &l15&rAnd he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and
  '14': 'give to his officers, and to his servants. &l16&rAnd he will take your menservants,
    and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them
    to his work. &l17&rHe will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.'
  '15': '&l18&rAnd ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall
    have chosen you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day. &l19&rNevertheless
    the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will
    have a king over us;'
  '16': '&l20&rThat we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge
    us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. &l21&rAnd Samuel heard all the
    words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord. &l22&rAnd
    the Lord said to'
  '17': Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.
  '18': 'Chapter 9

    Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son
    of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of
    power. &l2&rAnd he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly:'
  '19': 'and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he:
    from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people. &l3&rAnd the
    asses of Kish Saul''s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now
    one of the servants'
  '20': 'with thee, and arise, go seek the asses. &l4&rAnd he passed through mount
    Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then
    they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed
    through the land of the'
  '21': Benjamites, but they found them not. &l5&rAnd when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us. &l6&rAnd he said unto him,
  '22': 'Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man;
    all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he
    can shew us our way that we should go. &l7&rThen said Saul to his servant, But,
    behold, if we go,'
  '23': 'what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there
    is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? &l8&rAnd the servant
    answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of
    a shekel of silver:'
  '24': 'that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. &l9&r(Beforetime
    in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us
    go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
    &l10&rThen said Saul'
  '25': to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was. &l11&rAnd as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? &l12&rAnd they answered
  '26': 'them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came
    to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high
    place: &l13&rAs soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him,
    before he go up to'
  '27': 'the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because
    he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore
    get you up; for about this time ye shall find him. &l14&rAnd they went up into
    the city: and when'
  '28': they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place. &l15&rNow the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, &l16&rTo morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of
  '29': 'Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel,
    that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked
    upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. &l17&rAnd when Samuel saw Saul,
    the Lord said unto'
  '30': 'him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my
    people. &l18&rThen Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I
    pray thee, where the seer''s house is. &l19&rAnd Samuel answered Saul, and said,
    I am the seer: go up'
  '31': before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart. &l20&rAnd as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And
  '32': on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house? &l21&rAnd Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?
  '33': wherefore then speakest thou so to me? &l22&rAnd Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons. &l23&rAnd Samuel said unto the cook,
  '34': 'Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by
    thee. &l24&rAnd the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and
    set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before
    thee, and eat: for unto'
  '35': this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. &l25&rAnd when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house. &l26&rAnd they
  '36': 'arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel
    called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And
    Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. &l27&rAnd as
    they were going down'
  '37': to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.
  '38': 'Chapter 10

    Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and
    said, Is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?
    &l2&rWhen thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by'
  '39': 'Rachel''s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say
    unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father
    hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do
    for my son? &l3&rThen'
  '40': 'shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of
    Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying
    three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a
    bottle of wine:'
  '41': '&l4&rAnd they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which
    thou shalt receive of their hands. &l5&rAfter that thou shalt come to the hill
    of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when
    thou art come thither'
  '42': 'to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from
    the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them;
    and they shall prophesy: &l6&rAnd the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee,
    and thou shalt'
  '43': prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. &l7&rAnd let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee. &l8&rAnd thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down
  '44': 'unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace
    offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what
    thou shalt do. &l9&rAnd it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
    Samuel, God gave him'
  '45': 'another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day. &l10&rAnd when
    they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the
    Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them. &l11&rAnd it came to
    pass, when all that knew'
  '46': him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? &l12&rAnd one of the same place answered and said, But who is their
  '47': 'father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets? &l13&rAnd
    when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place. &l14&rAnd Saul''s
    uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek
    the asses:'
  '48': and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel. &l15&rAnd Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you. &l16&rAnd Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom,
  '49': whereof Samuel spake, he told him not. &l17&rAnd Samuel called the people together unto the Lord to Mizpeh; &l18&rAnd said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand
  '50': 'of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed
    you:'

  '2': and by your thousands. &l20&rAnd when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken. &l21&rWhen he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son
  '3': 'of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found. &l22&rTherefore

    Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the

    &l2&rAnd Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a'

  '11': hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the Lord fell on the people, and they
  '12': came out with one consent. &l8&rAnd when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. &l9&rAnd they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead,

    that they which'

  '22': land of Egypt. &l7&rNow therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the Lord of all the righteous acts of the Lord, which he did to you and to your fathers. &l8&rWhen Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the Lord, then the

  '30': 'thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the Lord and
    Samuel. &l19&rAnd all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto

    Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, &l2&rSaul
    chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in
    Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin:'
  '36': and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. &l3&rAnd Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. &l4&rAnd
  '37': all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal. &l5&rAnd the Philistines gathered themselves together to
  '38': 'fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and
    people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and
    pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven. &l6&rWhen the men of Israel saw that
    they were in a'
  '39': strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. &l7&rAnd some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in
  '40': 'Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. &l8&rAnd he tarried seven
    days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not
    to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. &l9&rAnd Saul said, Bring hither
    a burnt offering'
  '41': to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. &l10&rAnd it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. &l11&rAnd Samuel
  '42': said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; &l12&rTherefore said I, The Philistines
  '43': 'will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto
    the Lord: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. &l13&rAnd Samuel
    said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of
    the Lord thy God,'
  '44': 'which he commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom
    upon Israel for ever. &l14&rBut now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath
    sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain
    over his'
  '45': people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee. &l15&rAnd Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men. &l16&rAnd Saul, and Jonathan
  '46': 'his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin:
    but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. &l17&rAnd the spoilers came out of the
    camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that
    leadeth to'
  '47': 'Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: &l18&rAnd another company turned the way
    to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh
    to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. &l19&rNow there was no smith found
    throughout all the'
  '48': 'land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords
    or spears: &l20&rBut all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
    every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. &l21&rYet
    they had a file for'
  '49': the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. &l22&rSo it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and
  '50': 'Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. &l23&rAnd
    the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.'

    Chapter 14

    Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young
    man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines'' garrison,
    that is on the other side. But he told not his father. &l2&rAnd'
  '2': 'Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which
    is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men; &l3&rAnd
    Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod''s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of
    Eli, the Lord''s'
  '3': priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone. &l4&rAnd between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other
  '4': 'side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
    &l5&rThe forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and
    the other southward over against Gibeah. &l6&rAnd Jonathan said to the young man
    that bare his armour,'
  '5': 'Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may
    be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to save
    by many or by few. &l7&rAnd his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in
    thine heart: turn thee;'
  '6': behold, I am with thee according to thy heart. &l8&rThen said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them. &l9&rIf they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place,
  '7': 'and will not go up unto them. &l10&rBut if they say thus, Come up unto us;
    then we will go up: for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall
    be a sign unto us. &l11&rAnd both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison
    of the'
  '8': 'Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out
    of the holes where they had hid themselves. &l12&rAnd the men of the garrison
    answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew
    you a thing. And'
  '9': 'Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the Lord hath delivered
    them into the hand of Israel. &l13&rAnd Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and
    upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan;
    and his'
  '10': armourbearer slew after him. &l14&rAnd that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow. &l15&rAnd there was trembling in the host, in the field,
  '11': 'and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled,
    and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling. &l16&rAnd the watchmen
    of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away,
    and they went on'
  '12': beating down one another. &l17&rThen said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there. &l18&rAnd Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the
  '13': 'ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
    &l19&rAnd it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that
    was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the
    priest, Withdraw'
  '14': 'thine hand. &l20&rAnd Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
    themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man''s sword was against
    his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture. &l21&rMoreover the Hebrews
    that were with'
  '15': the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan. &l22&rLikewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount
  '16': 'Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed
    hard after them in the battle. &l23&rSo the Lord saved Israel that day: and the
    battle passed over unto Bethaven. &l24&rAnd the men of Israel were distressed
    that day: for Saul had'
  '17': adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food. &l25&rAnd all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground. &l26&rAnd
  '18': 'when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no
    man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath. &l27&rBut Jonathan
    heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth
    the end of the'
  '19': rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened. &l28&rThen answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that
  '20': 'eateth any food this day. And the people were faint. &l29&rThen said Jonathan,
    My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened,
    because I tasted a little of this honey. &l30&rHow much more, if haply the people
    had'
  '21': 'eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had
    there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines? &l31&rAnd they
    smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very
    faint. &l32&rAnd'
  '22': 'the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and
    slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood. &l33&rThen
    they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the Lord, in that they
    eat with the blood. And'
  '23': 'he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day. &l34&rAnd
    Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither
    every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin
    not against'
  '24': 'the Lord in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his
    ox with him that night, and slew them there. &l35&rAnd Saul built an altar unto
    the Lord: the same was the first altar that he built unto the Lord. &l36&rAnd
    Saul said, Let us go'
  '25': down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. &l37&rAnd Saul asked counsel of
  '26': 'God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the
    hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day. &l38&rAnd Saul said, Draw ye
    near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath
    been this day.'
  '27': '&l39&rFor, as the Lord liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan
    my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that
    answered him. &l40&rThen said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
    Jonathan my son will'
  '28': 'be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good
    unto thee. &l41&rTherefore Saul said unto the Lord God of Israel, Give a perfect
    lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped. &l42&rAnd Saul
    said, Cast lots between'
  '29': me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken. &l43&rThen Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die. &l44&rAnd
  '30': 'Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
    &l45&rAnd the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this
    great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the Lord liveth, there shall not one
    hair of his head fall'
  '31': 'to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued
    Jonathan, that he died not. &l46&rThen Saul went up from following the Philistines:
    and the Philistines went to their own place. &l47&rSo Saul took the kingdom over
    Israel, and'
  '32': 'fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the
    children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against
    the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them. &l48&rAnd
    he gathered an host,'
  '33': 'and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that
    spoiled them. &l49&rNow the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
    and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab,
    and the name of'
  '34': 'the younger Michal: &l50&rAnd the name of Saul''s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter
    of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner,
    Saul''s uncle. &l51&rAnd Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner
    was the son of'
  '35': 'Abiel. &l52&rAnd there was sore war against the Philistines all the days
    of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto
    him.'
  '36': 'Chapter 15

    Samuel also said unto Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his
    people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of
    the Lord. &l2&rThus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did
    to'
  '37': Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. &l3&rNow go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. &l4&rAnd Saul
  '38': gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. &l5&rAnd Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley. &l6&rAnd Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
  '39': 'among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness
    to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites
    departed from among the Amalekites. &l7&rAnd Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah
    until thou comest'
  '40': to Shur, that is over against Egypt. &l8&rAnd he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. &l9&rBut Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the
  '41': 'fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy
    them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. &l10&rThen
    came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying, &l11&rIt repenteth me that I have
    set up'
  '42': 'Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed
    my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the Lord all night.
    &l12&rAnd when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel,
    saying, Saul'
  '43': 'came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and
    passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. &l13&rAnd Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said
    unto him, Blessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the
    Lord. &l14&rAnd'
  '44': 'Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and
    the lowing of the oxen which I hear? &l15&rAnd Saul said, They have brought them
    from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen,
    to sacrifice unto'
  '45': the Lord thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. &l16&rThen Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on. &l17&rAnd Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight,
  '46': wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee king over Israel? &l18&rAnd the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
  '47': '&l19&rWherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but didst
    fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord? &l20&rAnd Saul said
    unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have gone the way which
    the Lord sent me,'
  '48': and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. &l21&rBut the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.
  '49': '&l22&rAnd Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings
    and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better
    than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. &l23&rFor rebellion is as
    the sin of witchcraft,'
  '50': and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.

    &l24&rAnd Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment
    of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
    &l25&rNow therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with'
  '2': 'me, that I may worship the Lord. &l26&rAnd Samuel said unto Saul, I will not
    return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath
    rejected thee from being king over Israel. &l27&rAnd as Samuel turned about to
    go away, he laid'
  '3': hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent. &l28&rAnd Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou. &l29&rAnd also the Strength of Israel will not
  '4': 'lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent. &l30&rThen he
    said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people,
    and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord thy God.
    &l31&rSo Samuel'
  '5': turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the Lord. &l32&rThen said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past. &l33&rAnd Samuel said, As thy
  '6': sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal. &l34&rThen Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. &l35&rAnd Samuel came no more to see
  '7': 'Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and
    the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.'
  '8': 'Chapter 16

    And the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have
    rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will
    send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.'
  '9': '&l2&rAnd Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And
    the Lord said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the
    Lord. &l3&rAnd call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt
    do: and thou shalt'
  '10': 'anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee. &l4&rAnd Samuel did that which
    the Lord spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at
    his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? &l5&rAnd he said, Peaceably: I am
    come to sacrifice unto the'
  '11': 'Lord: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified
    Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. &l6&rAnd it came to pass,
    when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord''s anointed
    is before'
  '12': 'him. &l7&rBut the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or
    on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not
    as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh
    on the heart. &l8&rThen'
  '13': Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this. &l9&rThen Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this. &l10&rAgain, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before
  '14': Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The Lord hath not chosen these. &l11&rAnd Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch
  '15': 'him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. &l12&rAnd he sent, and
    brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly
    to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he. &l13&rThen Samuel
    took the horn'
  '16': 'of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of
    the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to
    Ramah. &l14&rBut the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit
    from the Lord troubled'
  '17': 'him. &l15&rAnd Saul''s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
    from God troubleth thee. &l16&rLet our lord now command thy servants, which are
    before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall
    come to pass, when the'
  '18': evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. &l17&rAnd Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me. &l18&rThen answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I
  '19': have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the Lord is with him. &l19&rWherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
  '20': 'David thy son, which is with the sheep. &l20&rAnd Jesse took an ass laden
    with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto
    Saul. &l21&rAnd David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly;
    and he became his'
  '21': 'armourbearer. &l22&rAnd Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee,
    stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. &l23&rAnd it came to pass,
    when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played
    with his hand: so'
  '22': Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
  '23': 'Chapter 17

    Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered
    together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and
    Azekah, in Ephesdammim. &l2&rAnd Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together,'
  '24': 'and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the
    Philistines. &l3&rAnd the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
    Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
    &l4&rAnd there went'
  '25': out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. &l5&rAnd he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels
  '26': 'of brass. &l6&rAnd he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of
    brass between his shoulders. &l7&rAnd the staff of his spear was like a weaver''s
    beam; and his spear''s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing
    a shield went before'
  '27': him. &l8&rAnd he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. &l9&rIf he be able to
  '28': 'fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail
    against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us. &l10&rAnd
    the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that
    we may fight'
  '29': 'together. &l11&rWhen Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
    they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. &l12&rNow David was the son of that Ephrathite
    of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went
    among men'
  '30': 'for an old man in the days of Saul. &l13&rAnd the three eldest sons of Jesse
    went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went
    to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third
    Shammah.'
  '31': '&l14&rAnd David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul. &l15&rBut
    David went and returned from Saul to feed his father''s sheep at Bethlehem. &l16&rAnd
    the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
    &l17&rAnd'
  '32': Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of thy brethren; &l18&rAnd carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and
  '33': take their pledge. &l19&rNow Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. &l20&rAnd David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded
  '34': him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle. &l21&rFor Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army. &l22&rAnd David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
  '35': 'carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren. &l23&rAnd
    as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of
    Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according
    to the same words:'
  '36': 'and David heard them. &l24&rAnd all the men of Israel, when they saw the
    man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. &l25&rAnd the men of Israel said, Have
    ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it
    shall be, that the man'
  '37': who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel. &l26&rAnd David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine,
  '38': and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? &l27&rAnd the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him. &l28&rAnd
  '39': Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine
  '40': 'heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. &l29&rAnd
    David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause? &l30&rAnd he turned from
    him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him
    again after the'
  '41': 'former manner. &l31&rAnd when the words were heard which David spake, they
    rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him. &l32&rAnd David said to Saul,
    Let no man''s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this
    Philistine. &l33&rAnd'
  '42': 'Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight
    with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. &l34&rAnd
    David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father''s sheep, and there came a lion,
    and a bear, and'
  '43': 'took a lamb out of the flock: &l35&rAnd I went out after him, and smote him,
    and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him
    by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. &l36&rThy servant slew both the lion
    and the bear: and'
  '44': this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. &l37&rDavid said moreover, The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand
  '45': of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the Lord be with thee. &l38&rAnd Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. &l39&rAnd David girded his sword upon his armour,
  '46': and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him. &l40&rAnd he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put
  '47': 'them in a shepherd''s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was
    in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine. &l41&rAnd the Philistine came
    on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
    &l42&rAnd when the'
  '48': 'Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but
    a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. &l43&rAnd the Philistine said unto
    David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed
    David by his gods.'
  '49': '&l44&rAnd the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh
    unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. &l45&rThen said David
    to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with
    a shield: but I'
  '50': come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.

    &l46&rThis day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee,
    and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the
    Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the'
  '2': 'earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. &l47&rAnd
    all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for
    the battle is the Lord''s, and he will give you into our hands. &l48&rAnd it came
    to pass, when the'
  '3': Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. &l49&rAnd David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the
  '4': stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth. &l50&rSo David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. &l51&rTherefore David
  '5': ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. &l52&rAnd the men of Israel and of Judah arose,
  '6': and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. &l53&rAnd the children of Israel returned from chasing
  '7': after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. &l54&rAnd David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. &l55&rAnd when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the
  '8': captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell. &l56&rAnd the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is. &l57&rAnd as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took
  '9': him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. &l58&rAnd Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
  '10': 'Chapter 18

    And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul
    of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own
    soul. &l2&rAnd Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his'
  '11': father's house. &l3&rThen Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. &l4&rAnd Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his
  '12': 'girdle. &l5&rAnd David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
    himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the
    sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul''s servants. &l6&rAnd it
    came to pass as they'
  '13': came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. &l7&rAnd the women answered one another as
  '14': 'they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
    &l8&rAnd Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They
    have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands:
    and what'
  '15': 'can he have more but the kingdom? &l9&rAnd Saul eyed David from that day
    and forward. &l10&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from
    God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played
    with his hand, as at'
  '16': 'other times: and there was a javelin in Saul''s hand. &l11&rAnd Saul cast
    the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David
    avoided out of his presence twice. &l12&rAnd Saul was afraid of David, because
    the Lord was with him,'
  '17': and was departed from Saul. &l13&rTherefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. &l14&rAnd David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the Lord was with him.
  '18': '&l15&rWherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was
    afraid of him. &l16&rBut all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out
    and came in before them. &l17&rAnd Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter
    Merab, her will I give'
  '19': 'thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the Lord''s battles.
    For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines
    be upon him. &l18&rAnd David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or
    my father''s family in'
  '20': 'Israel, that I should be son in law to the king? &l19&rBut it came to pass
    at the time when Merab Saul''s daughter should have been given to David, that
    she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. &l20&rAnd Michal Saul''s daughter
    loved David: and'
  '21': they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. &l21&rAnd Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of
  '22': 'the twain. &l22&rAnd Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
    secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants
    love thee: now therefore be the king''s son in law. &l23&rAnd Saul''s servants
    spake those words in'
  '23': the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed? &l24&rAnd the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David. &l25&rAnd Saul said, Thus shall ye
  '24': say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. &l26&rAnd when his servants told David these words, it
  '25': 'pleased David well to be the king''s son in law: and the days were not expired.
    &l27&rWherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines
    two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full
    tale to the'
  '26': king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. &l28&rAnd Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him. &l29&rAnd Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul
  '27': 'became David''s enemy continually. &l30&rThen the princes of the Philistines
    went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself
    more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.'
  '28': 'Chapter 19

    And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should
    kill David. &l2&rBut Jonathan Saul''s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
    told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray
    thee,'
  '29': 'take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and
    hide thyself: &l3&rAnd I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where
    thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will
    tell thee. &l4&rAnd'
  '30': 'Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let
    not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned
    against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good: &l5&rFor
    he did put his life in'
  '31': 'his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great salvation
    for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin
    against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause? &l6&rAnd Saul hearkened
    unto the voice of'
  '32': 'Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the Lord liveth, he shall not be slain. &l7&rAnd
    Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan
    brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past. &l8&rAnd
    there was war again:'
  '33': 'and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a
    great slaughter; and they fled from him. &l9&rAnd the evil spirit from the Lord
    was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David
    played with his hand.'
  '34': '&l10&rAnd Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin: but
    he slipped away out of Saul''s presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall:
    and David fled, and escaped that night. &l11&rSaul also sent messengers unto David''s
    house, to watch'
  '35': 'him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David''s wife told him, saying,
    If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain. &l12&rSo Michal
    let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped. &l13&rAnd
    Michal took an'
  '36': image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth. &l14&rAnd when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick. &l15&rAnd Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him
  '37': up to me in the bed, that I may slay him. &l16&rAnd when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster. &l17&rAnd Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine
  '38': enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee? &l18&rSo David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
  '39': '&l19&rAnd it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
    &l20&rAnd Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of
    the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit
    of God was upon the'
  '40': messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. &l21&rAnd when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also. &l22&rThen went he also to Ramah, and came to a
  '41': 'great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and
    David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah. &l23&rAnd he went thither
    to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and
    prophesied, until'
  '42': he came to Naioth in Ramah. &l24&rAnd he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?
  '43': 'Chapter 20

    And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have
    I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh
    my life? &l2&rAnd he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my'
  '44': 'father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me:
    and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so. &l3&rAnd David
    sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace
    in thine eyes; and he'
  '45': 'saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the Lord
    liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death. &l4&rThen
    said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for
    thee. &l5&rAnd'
  '46': 'David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should
    not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in
    the field unto the third day at even. &l6&rIf thy father at all miss me, then
    say, David earnestly'
  '47': 'asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a
    yearly sacrifice there for all the family. &l7&rIf he say thus, It is well; thy
    servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined
    by him.'
  '48': '&l8&rTherefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought
    thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee: notwithstanding, if there be
    in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
    &l9&rAnd Jonathan'
  '49': 'said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined
    by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee? &l10&rThen said
    David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
    &l11&rAnd Jonathan'
  '50': said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.

    &l12&rAnd Jonathan said unto David, O Lord God of Israel, when I have sounded
    my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be
    good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee; &l13&rThe
    Lord'
  '2': 'do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil,

    empty. &l19&rAnd when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly,
    and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand,
    and shalt'
  '6': remain by the stone Ezel. &l20&rAnd I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark. &l21&rAnd, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of

    the matter'
  '8': 'which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the Lord be between thee and me for
    ever. &l24&rSo David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come,
    the king sat him down to eat meat. &l25&rAnd the king sat upon his seat, as at
    other times, even'
  '9': 'upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul''s side,
    and David''s place was empty. &l26&rNevertheless Saul spake not any thing that
    day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is
    not clean. &l27&rAnd it'
  '10': 'came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David''s
    place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the
    son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day? &l28&rAnd Jonathan answered
    Saul, David'
  '11': 'earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem: &l29&rAnd he said, Let me
    go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother,
    he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes,
    let me get away, I pray'
  '12': thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table. &l30&rThen Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine
  '13': own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness? &l31&rFor as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die. &l32&rAnd
  '14': 'Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he
    be slain? what hath he done? &l33&rAnd Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him:
    whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David. &l34&rSo
    Jonathan arose from'
  '15': 'the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month:
    for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame. &l35&rAnd
    it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time
    appointed with'
  '16': David, and a little lad with him. &l36&rAnd he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. &l37&rAnd when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried
  '17': 'after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee? &l38&rAnd Jonathan
    cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan''s lad gathered
    up the arrows, and came to his master. &l39&rBut the lad knew not any thing: only
    Jonathan and David'
  '18': knew the matter. &l40&rAnd Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city. &l41&rAnd as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself
  '19': 'three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until
    David exceeded. &l42&rAnd Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we
    have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord be between me
    and thee, and between my'
  '20': 'seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went
    into the city.'
  '21': 'Chapter 21

    Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the
    meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?
    &l2&rAnd David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business,'
  '22': 'and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout
    I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants
    to such and such a place. &l3&rNow therefore what is under thine hand? give me
    five loaves of bread in'
  '23': mine hand, or what there is present. &l4&rAnd the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women. &l5&rAnd David answered the priest, and
  '24': said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel. &l6&rSo the priest gave
  '25': 'him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that
    was taken from before the Lord, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken
    away. &l7&rNow a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained
    before the Lord; and'
  '26': his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul. &l8&rAnd David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's
  '27': 'business required haste. &l9&rAnd the priest said, The sword of Goliath the
    Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped
    in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no
    other save that here.'
  '28': And David said, There is none like that; give it me. &l10&rAnd David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. &l11&rAnd the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing
  '29': one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? &l12&rAnd David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. &l13&rAnd he changed his behaviour before them, and
  '30': 'feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,
    and let his spittle fall down upon his beard. &l14&rThen said Achish unto his
    servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?
    &l15&rHave I need of'
  '31': mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?
  '32': 'Chapter 22

    David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his
    brethren and all his father''s house heard it, they went down thither to him.
    &l2&rAnd every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every
    one'
  '33': 'that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain
    over them: and there were with him about four hundred men. &l3&rAnd David went
    thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and
    my mother, I pray'
  '34': 'thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me. &l4&rAnd
    he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while
    that David was in the hold. &l5&rAnd the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not
    in the hold;'
  '35': depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth. &l6&rWhen Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his
  '36': hand, and all his servants were standing about him;) &l7&rThen Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains
  '37': of hundreds; &l8&rThat all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant
  '38': against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? &l9&rThen answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. &l10&rAnd he enquired of the Lord for him, and gave
  '39': 'him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. &l11&rThen
    the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father''s
    house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king. &l12&rAnd
    Saul said,'
  '40': Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord. &l13&rAnd Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should
  '41': rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? &l14&rThen Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house? &l15&rDid
  '42': 'I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king
    impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy
    servant knew nothing of all this, less or more. &l16&rAnd the king said, Thou
    shalt surely die,'
  '43': 'Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father''s house. &l17&rAnd the king said unto
    the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the Lord: because
    their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not
    shew it to me. But'
  '44': the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord. &l18&rAnd the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore
  '45': and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. &l19&rAnd Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword. &l20&rAnd one of the sons of
  '46': Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. &l21&rAnd Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the Lord's priests. &l22&rAnd David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would
  '47': 'surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father''s
    house. &l23&rAbide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh
    thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.'
  '48': 'Chapter 23

    Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and
    they rob the threshingfloors. &l2&rTherefore David enquired of the Lord, saying,
    Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said unto David, Go, and
    smite'
  '49': 'the Philistines, and save Keilah. &l3&rAnd David''s men said unto him, Behold,
    we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the
    armies of the Philistines? &l4&rThen David enquired of the Lord yet again. And
    the Lord answered'
  '50': him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

    &l5&rSo David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and
    brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved
    the inhabitants of Keilah. &l6&rAnd it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of'
  '2': Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand. &l7&rAnd it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and
  '3': bars. &l8&rAnd Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. &l9&rAnd David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. &l10&rThen
  '4': said David, O Lord God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. &l11&rWill the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Lord God of
  '5': Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the Lord said, He will come down. &l12&rThen said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the Lord said, They will deliver thee up. &l13&rThen David and his men, which
  '6': were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth. &l14&rAnd David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a
  '7': 'mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God
    delivered him not into his hand. &l15&rAnd David saw that Saul was come out to
    seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. &l16&rAnd Jonathan
    Saul''s son arose,'
  '8': 'and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God. &l17&rAnd
    he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee;
    and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also
    Saul my father'
  '9': 'knoweth. &l18&rAnd they two made a covenant before the Lord: and David abode
    in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house. &l19&rThen came up the Ziphites to
    Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in
    the wood, in the'
  '10': hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon? &l20&rNow therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand. &l21&rAnd Saul said, Blessed be ye of the Lord; for
  '11': 'ye have compassion on me. &l22&rGo, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and
    see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told
    me that he dealeth very subtilly. &l23&rSee therefore, and take knowledge of all
    the lurking places'
  '12': 'where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and
    I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will
    search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah. &l24&rAnd they arose, and
    went to Ziph before'
  '13': 'Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain
    on the south of Jeshimon. &l25&rSaul also and his men went to seek him. And they
    told David; wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of
    Maon. And when Saul'
  '14': 'heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. &l26&rAnd Saul
    went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain:
    and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed
    David and'
  '15': 'his men round about to take them. &l27&rBut there came a messenger unto Saul,
    saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. &l28&rWherefore
    Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore
    they'
  '16': called that place Selahammahlekoth. &l29&rAnd David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.
  '17': 'Chapter 24

    And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that
    it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi. &l2&rThen
    Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David
    and'
  '18': 'his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. &l3&rAnd he came to the sheepcotes
    by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and
    his men remained in the sides of the cave. &l4&rAnd the men of David said unto
    him, Behold the day'
  '19': of which the Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily. &l5&rAnd it came to pass afterward, that
  '20': David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. &l6&rAnd he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.
  '21': '&l7&rSo David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not
    to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way. &l8&rDavid
    also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying,
    My lord the'
  '22': king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself. &l9&rAnd David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? &l10&rBehold, this day thine eyes have seen how
  '23': 'that the Lord had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some
    bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth
    mine hand against my lord; for he is the Lord''s anointed. &l11&rMoreover, my
    father, see, yea, see'
  '24': 'the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy
    robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression
    in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to
    take it.'
  '25': '&l12&rThe Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord avenge me of thee:
    but mine hand shall not be upon thee. &l13&rAs saith the proverb of the ancients,
    Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. &l14&rAfter
    whom is the'
  '26': king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. &l15&rThe Lord therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand. &l16&rAnd it came to pass, when David had
  '27': 'made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy
    voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. &l17&rAnd he said
    to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas
    I have rewarded thee'
  '28': 'evil. &l18&rAnd thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with
    me: forasmuch as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst
    me not. &l19&rFor if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore
    the Lord reward'
  '29': thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day. &l20&rAnd now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. &l21&rSwear now therefore unto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut
  '30': off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house. &l22&rAnd David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.
  '31': 'Chapter 25

    And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him,
    and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness
    of Paran. &l2&rAnd there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in'
  '32': 'Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and
    a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. &l3&rNow the name of
    the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good
    understanding, and of'
  '33': 'a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings;
    and he was of the house of Caleb. &l4&rAnd David heard in the wilderness that
    Nabal did shear his sheep. &l5&rAnd David sent out ten young men, and David said
    unto the young men, Get'
  '34': 'you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name: &l6&rAnd thus
    shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace
    be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast. &l7&rAnd now I have heard
    that thou hast'
  '35': 'shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither
    was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel. &l8&rAsk
    thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour
    in thine eyes: for we'
  '36': 'come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto
    thy servants, and to thy son David. &l9&rAnd when David''s young men came, they
    spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
    &l10&rAnd Nabal'
  '37': answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master. &l11&rShall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers,
  '38': and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be? &l12&rSo David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings. &l13&rAnd David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his
  '39': 'sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David
    about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff. &l14&rBut one of the
    young men told Abigail, Nabal''s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out
    of the wilderness to'
  '40': 'salute our master; and he railed on them. &l15&rBut the men were very good
    unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were
    conversant with them, when we were in the fields: &l16&rThey were a wall unto
    us both by night and'
  '41': 'day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. &l17&rNow therefore
    know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master,
    and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot
    speak to him.'
  '42': '&l18&rThen Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles
    of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and
    an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on
    asses. &l19&rAnd she'
  '43': said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal. &l20&rAnd it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she
  '44': 'met them. &l21&rNow David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
    fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained
    unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good. &l22&rSo and more also do God
    unto the enemies of'
  '45': David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. &l23&rAnd when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, &l24&rAnd fell
  '46': 'at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and
    let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of
    thine handmaid. &l25&rLet not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial,
    even Nabal: for as his'
  '47': 'name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine
    handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send. &l26&rNow therefore,
    my lord, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the Lord hath withholden
    thee from'
  '48': coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. &l27&rAnd now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men
  '49': 'that follow my lord. &l28&rI pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid:
    for the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth
    the battles of the Lord, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days. &l29&rYet
    a man is'
  '50': 'risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall
    be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God; and the souls of thine enemies,
    them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.'

    to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed
    thee ruler over Israel; &l31&rThat this shall be no grief unto thee, nor'

    or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the Lord shall have dealt well

    was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart
    died within him, and'

    to Carmel, they spake'
  '9': unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife. &l41&rAnd she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. &l42&rAnd Abigail
  '10': hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife. &l43&rDavid also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives. &l44&rBut Saul had

    And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself
    in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon? &l2&rThen Saul arose, and went
    down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with
    him,'
  '13': to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. &l3&rAnd Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. &l4&rDavid therefore sent out spies,
  '14': 'and understood that Saul was come in very deed. &l5&rAnd David arose, and
    came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul
    lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench,
    and the people'
  '15': pitched round about him. &l6&rThen answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee. &l7&rSo David and
  '16': 'Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within
    the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the
    people lay round about him. &l8&rThen said Abishai to David, God hath delivered
    thine enemy into'
  '17': 'thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the
    spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time. &l9&rAnd
    David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against
    the Lord''s'
  '18': anointed, and be guiltless? &l10&rDavid said furthermore, As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish. &l11&rThe Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the
  '19': 'Lord''s anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his
    bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go. &l12&rSo David took the spear
    and the cruse of water from Saul''s bolster; and they gat them away, and no man
    saw it, nor knew it,'
  '20': 'neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the Lord
    was fallen upon them. &l13&rThen David went over to the other side, and stood
    on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them: &l14&rAnd David
    cried to the'
  '21': people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king? &l15&rAnd David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast
  '22': thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. &l16&rThis thing is not good that thou hast done. As the Lord liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the Lord's anointed. And
  '23': now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster. &l17&rAnd Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king. &l18&rAnd he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus
  '24': 'pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?
    &l19&rNow therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant.
    If the Lord have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if
    they be the'
  '25': 'children of men, cursed be they before the Lord; for they have driven me
    out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other
    gods. &l20&rNow therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face
    of the Lord: for the'
  '26': 'king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge
    in the mountains. &l21&rThen said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for
    I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day:
    behold, I have'
  '27': played the fool, and have erred exceedingly. &l22&rAnd David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it. &l23&rThe Lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the Lord delivered
  '28': thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the Lord's anointed. &l24&rAnd, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord, and let him deliver me out of all
  '29': 'tribulation. &l25&rThen Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David:
    thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on
    his way, and Saul returned to his place.'
  '30': 'Chapter 27

    And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there
    is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the
    Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of'
  '31': 'Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand. &l2&rAnd David arose, and he passed
    over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch,
    king of Gath. &l3&rAnd David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every
    man with his'
  '32': 'household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail
    the Carmelitess, Nabal''s wife. &l4&rAnd it was told Saul that David was fled
    to Gath: and he sought no more again for him. &l5&rAnd David said unto Achish,
    If I have now found'
  '33': 'grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country,
    that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with
    thee? &l6&rThen Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto
    the kings of Judah'
  '34': 'unto this day. &l7&rAnd the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines
    was a full year and four months. &l8&rAnd David and his men went up, and invaded
    the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of
    old the'
  '35': inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt. &l9&rAnd David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came
  '36': to Achish. &l10&rAnd Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites. &l11&rAnd David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring
  '37': tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines. &l12&rAnd Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him;
  '38': therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
  '39': 'Chapter 28

    And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies
    together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou
    assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men. &l2&rAnd
    David'
  '40': said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever. &l3&rNow Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And
  '41': 'Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of
    the land. &l4&rAnd the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
    pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in
    Gilboa. &l5&rAnd when'
  '42': Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled. &l6&rAnd when Saul enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. &l7&rThen said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman
  '43': that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor. &l8&rAnd Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with
  '44': 'him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine
    unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.
    &l9&rAnd the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how
    he hath cut off'
  '45': 'those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore
    then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die? &l10&rAnd Saul sware
    to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord liveth, there shall no punishment happen
    to thee for this'
  '46': 'thing. &l11&rThen said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
    said, Bring me up Samuel. &l12&rAnd when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with
    a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me?
    for thou art Saul.'
  '47': '&l13&rAnd the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And
    the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth. &l14&rAnd he
    said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he
    is covered with a mantle.'
  '48': And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself. &l15&rAnd Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against
  '49': 'me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets,
    nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto
    me what I shall do. &l16&rThen said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me,
    seeing the Lord is'
  '50': 'departed from thee, and is become thine enemy? &l17&rAnd the Lord hath done
    to him, as he spake by me: for the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand,
    and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:'

  '1': 'Chapter 28 Cont.

    &l18&rBecause thou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his fierce
    wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto thee this day.
    &l19&rMoreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the'
  '2': 'Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the Lord also
    shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines. &l20&rThen
    Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of
    the words of Samuel:'
  '3': and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. &l21&rAnd the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my
  '4': hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me. &l22&rNow therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest
  '5': on thy way. &l23&rBut he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. &l24&rAnd the woman had a fat calf in the house; and
  '6': 'she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened
    bread thereof: &l25&rAnd she brought it before Saul, and before his servants;
    and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.'
  '7': 'Chapter 29

    Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites
    pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel. &l2&rAnd the lords of the Philistines
    passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the'
  '8': rereward with Achish. &l3&rThen said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these
  '9': years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day? &l4&rAnd the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which
  '10': 'thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest
    in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself
    unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men? &l5&rIs not this
    David, of whom they'
  '11': sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands? &l6&rThen Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the Lord liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is
  '12': 'good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy
    coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not. &l7&rWherefore
    now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
    &l8&rAnd David'
  '13': said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king? &l9&rAnd Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou
  '14': 'art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of
    the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle. &l10&rWherefore
    now rise up early in the morning with thy master''s servants that are come with
    thee: and as soon'
  '15': as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart. &l11&rSo David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
  '16': 'Chapter 30

    And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day,
    that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and
    burned it with fire; &l2&rAnd had taken the women captives, that were therein:
    they'
  '17': slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way. &l3&rSo David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. &l4&rThen David
  '18': and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. &l5&rAnd David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. &l6&rAnd David was greatly
  '19': 'distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all
    the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David
    encouraged himself in the Lord his God. &l7&rAnd David said to Abiathar the priest,
    Ahimelech''s son, I'
  '20': 'pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod
    to David. &l8&rAnd David enquired at the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this
    troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely
    overtake them,'
  '21': 'and without fail recover all. &l9&rSo David went, he and the six hundred
    men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left
    behind stayed. &l10&rBut David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
    abode behind, which'
  '22': were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor. &l11&rAnd they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water; &l12&rAnd they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and
  '23': 'two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to
    him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
    &l13&rAnd David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And
    he said, I am a young'
  '24': man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick. &l14&rWe made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag
  '25': with fire. &l15&rAnd David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company. &l16&rAnd when he
  '26': had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. &l17&rAnd David smote them from
  '27': 'the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not
    a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.
    &l18&rAnd David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David
    rescued his two wives.'
  '28': '&l19&rAnd there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither
    sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them:
    David recovered all. &l20&rAnd David took all the flocks and the herds, which
    they drave before'
  '29': 'those other cattle, and said, This is David''s spoil. &l21&rAnd David came
    to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David,
    whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet
    David, and to meet the'
  '30': 'people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted
    them. &l22&rThen answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that
    went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them
    ought of the spoil'
  '31': that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart. &l23&rThen said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the Lord hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company
  '32': 'that came against us into our hand. &l24&rFor who will hearken unto you in
    this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part
    be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike. &l25&rAnd it was so from
    that day forward,'
  '33': that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day. &l26&rAnd when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord; &l27&rTo
  '34': them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir, &l28&rAnd to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa, &l29&rAnd to them which were in Rachal, and
  '35': to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites, &l30&rAnd to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach, &l31&rAnd to them which were in
  '36': Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.
  '37': 'Chapter 31

    Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before
    the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. &l2&rAnd the Philistines
    followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan,
    and'
  '38': Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons. &l3&rAnd the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. &l4&rThen said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these
  '39': uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. &l5&rAnd when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died
  '40': with him. &l6&rSo Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together. &l7&rAnd when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of
  '41': Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. &l8&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons
  '42': fallen in mount Gilboa. &l9&rAnd they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people. &l10&rAnd they put his armour in the house of
  '43': 'Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan. &l11&rAnd
    when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done
    to Saul; &l12&rAll the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body
    of Saul and the'
  '44': bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. &l13&rAnd they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
