  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord
    Jesus Christ, which is our hope; &l2&rUnto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace,
    mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. &l3&rAs I'
  '2': besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, &l4&rNeither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is
  '3': 'in faith: so do. &l5&rNow the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure
    heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: &l6&rFrom which some
    having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; &l7&rDesiring to be teachers
    of the law;'
  '4': understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm. &l8&rBut we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; &l9&rKnowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for
  '5': sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, &l10&rFor whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that
  '6': is contrary to sound doctrine; &l11&rAccording to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. &l12&rAnd I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
  '7': '&l13&rWho was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I
    obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. &l14&rAnd the grace of
    our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
    &l15&rThis is a faithful'
  '8': saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. &l16&rHowbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which
  '9': should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. &l17&rNow unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. &l18&rThis charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which
  '10': 'went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; &l19&rHolding
    faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have
    made shipwreck: &l20&rOf whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered
    unto Satan,'
  '11': that they may learn not to blaspheme.
  '12': 'Chapter 2

    I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,
    and giving of thanks, be made for all men; &l2&rFor kings, and for all that are
    in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and
    honesty.'
  '13': ' &l3&rFor this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; &l4&rWho
    will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. &l5&rFor
    there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
    &l6&rWho gave'
  '14': himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. &l7&rWhereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. &l8&rI will therefore that men pray every where,
  '15': lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. &l9&rIn like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; &l10&rBut (which becometh women
  '16': professing godliness) with good works. &l11&rLet the woman learn in silence with all subjection. &l12&rBut I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. &l13&rFor Adam was first formed, then Eve. &l14&rAnd Adam
  '17': was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. &l15&rNotwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
  '18': 'Chapter 3

    This is a true saying, if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good
    work. &l2&rA bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant,
    sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; &l3&rNot given to
    wine,'
  '19': no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; &l4&rOne that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; &l5&r(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of
  '20': the church of God?) &l6&rNot a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil. &l7&rMoreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. &l8&rLikewise must
  '21': the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; &l9&rHolding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. &l10&rAnd let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found
  '22': blameless. &l11&rEven so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. &l12&rLet the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. &l13&rFor they that have used the office of a deacon well
  '23': 'purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which
    is in Christ Jesus. &l14&rThese things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto
    thee shortly: &l15&rBut if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
    to behave thyself in'
  '24': 'the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground
    of the truth. &l16&rAnd without controversy great is the mystery of godliness:
    God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached
    unto the'
  '25': Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
  '26': 'Chapter 4

    Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart
    from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; &l2&rSpeaking
    lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;'
  '27': '&l3&rForbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God
    hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the
    truth. &l4&rFor every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it
    be received with'
  '28': 'thanksgiving: &l5&rFor it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. &l6&rIf
    thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister
    of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto
    thou hast'
  '29': 'attained. &l7&rBut refuse profane and old wives'' fables, and exercise thyself
    rather unto godliness. &l8&rFor bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness
    is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of
    that which is to'
  '30': come. &l9&rThis is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. &l10&rFor therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe. &l11&rThese things command and
  '31': teach. &l12&rLet no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. &l13&rTill I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. &l14&rNeglect not the gift
  '32': that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. &l15&rMeditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. &l16&rTake heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine;
  '33': 'continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them
    that hear thee.'
  '34': 'Chapter 5

    Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;
    &l2&rThe elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity. &l3&rHonour
    widows that are widows indeed. &l4&rBut if any widow have children or'
  '35': 'nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their
    parents: for that is good and acceptable before God. &l5&rNow she that is a widow
    indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers
    night and day.'
  '36': '&l6&rBut she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth. &l7&rAnd these
    things give in charge, that they may be blameless. &l8&rBut if any provide not
    for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith,
    and is worse than'
  '37': an infidel. &l9&rLet not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man. &l10&rWell reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints'
  '38': 'feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed
    every good work. &l11&rBut the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun
    to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; &l12&rHaving damnation, because
    they have cast off their'
  '39': first faith. &l13&rAnd withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. &l14&rI will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide
  '40': the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. &l15&rFor some are already turned aside after Satan. &l16&rIf any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve
  '41': them that are widows indeed. &l17&rLet the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine. &l18&rFor the scripture saith, thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The
  '42': labourer is worthy of his reward. &l19&rAgainst an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses. &l20&rThem that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. &l21&rI charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
  '43': 'elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before
    another, doing nothing by partiality. &l22&rLay hands suddenly on no man, neither
    be partaker of other men''s sins: keep thyself pure. &l23&rDrink no longer water,
    but use a little'
  '44': wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities. &l24&rSome men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after. &l25&rLikewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise
  '45': cannot be hid.
  '46': 'Chapter 6

    Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all
    honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. &l2&rAnd they
    that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren;
    but'
  '47': rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. &l3&rIf any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which
  '48': is according to godliness; &l4&rHe is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, &l5&rPerverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing
  '49': 'that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself. &l6&rBut godliness with
    contentment is great gain. &l7&rFor we brought nothing into this world, and it
    is certain we can carry nothing out. &l8&rAnd having food and raiment let us be
    therewith content.'
  '50': '&l9&rBut they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into
    many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.'

    &l10&rFor the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted
    after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many
    sorrows. &l11&rBut thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after'
  '2': righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. &l12&rFight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. &l13&rI give thee charge in the sight of
  '3': 'God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius

    to distribute,'

  '7': 'oppositions of science falsely so called: &l21&rWhich some professing have
    erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.'
