  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
    unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all
    Achaia: &l2&rGrace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord
    Jesus'
  '2': Christ. &l3&rBlessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; &l4&rWho comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith
  '3': we ourselves are comforted of God. &l5&rFor as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. &l6&rAnd whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same
  '4': 'sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your
    consolation and salvation. &l7&rAnd our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that
    as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.
    &l8&rFor we would not,'
  '5': 'brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that
    we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even
    of life: &l9&rBut we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not
    trust in ourselves,'
  '6': 'but in God which raiseth the dead: &l10&rWho delivered us from so great a
    death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us; &l11&rYe
    also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by
    the means of many'
  '7': persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf. &l12&rFor our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and
  '8': more abundantly to you-ward. &l13&rFor we write none other things unto you, that what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; &l14&rAs also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are
  '9': our's in the day of the Lord Jesus. &l15&rAnd in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit; &l16&rAnd to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my
  '10': way toward Judaea. &l17&rWhen I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? &l18&rBut as God is true, our word toward you was not yea
  '11': and nay. &l19&rFor the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. &l20&rFor all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by
  '12': us. &l21&rNow he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; &l22&rWho hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. &l23&rMoreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as
  '13': 'yet unto Corinth. &l24&rNot for that we have dominion over your faith, but
    are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.'
  '14': 'Chapter 2

    But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
    &l2&rFor if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same
    which is made sorry by me? &l3&rAnd I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came,'
  '15': I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. &l4&rFor out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye
  '16': 'might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. &l5&rBut if any
    have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge
    you all. &l6&rSufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted
    of many. &l7&rSo'
  '17': that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. &l8&rWherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. &l9&rFor to this end also did I write, that I
  '18': 'might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. &l10&rTo
    whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom
    I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ; &l11&rLest
    Satan should get an'
  '19': 'advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. &l12&rFurthermore,
    when I came to Troas to preach Christ''s gospel, and a door was opened unto me
    of the Lord, &l13&rI had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother:
    but taking my'
  '20': leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. &l14&rNow thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. &l15&rFor we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them
  '21': 'that are saved, and in them that perish: &l16&rTo the one we are the savour
    of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is
    sufficient for these things? &l17&rFor we are not as many, which corrupt the word
    of God: but as of'
  '22': sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
  '23': 'Chapter 3

    Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of
    commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you? &l2&rYe are our epistle
    written in our hearts, known and read of all men: &l3&rForasmuch as ye are'
  '24': 'manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written
    not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but
    in fleshy tables of the heart. &l4&rAnd such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
    &l5&rNot that'
  '25': 'we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our
    sufficiency is of God; &l6&rWho also hath made us able ministers of the new testament;
    not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth
    life.'
  '26': '&l7&rBut if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was
    glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face
    of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: &l8&rHow
    shall not the'
  '27': ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? &l9&rFor if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. &l10&rFor even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of
  '28': 'the glory that excelleth. &l11&rFor if that which is done away was glorious,
    much more that which remaineth is glorious. &l12&rSeeing then that we have such
    hope, we use great plainness of speech: &l13&rAnd not as Moses, which put a veil
    over his face,'
  '29': 'that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that
    which is abolished: &l14&rBut their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth
    the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is
    done away in Christ.'
  '30': ' &l15&rBut even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their
    heart. &l16&rNevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken
    away. &l17&rNow the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
    there is liberty.'
  '31': '&l18&rBut we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the
    Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit
    of the Lord.'
  '32': 'Chapter 4

    Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
    &l2&rBut have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness,
    nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth'
  '33': 'commending ourselves to every man''s conscience in the sight of God. &l3&rBut
    if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: &l4&rIn whom the god of
    this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of
    the glorious gospel'
  '34': of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. &l5&rFor we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. &l6&rFor God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts,
  '35': to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. &l7&rBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. &l8&rWe are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we
  '36': are perplexed, but not in despair; &l9&rPersecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; &l10&rAlways bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. &l11&rFor we which live
  '37': are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. &l12&rSo then death worketh in us, but life in you. &l13&rWe having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed,
  '38': and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; &l14&rKnowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. &l15&rFor all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might
  '39': through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. &l16&rFor which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. &l17&rFor our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far
  '40': 'more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; &l18&rWhile we look not at the
    things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which
    are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.'
  '41': 'Chapter 5

    For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have
    a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. &l2&rFor
    in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is'
  '42': 'from heaven: &l3&rIf so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
    &l4&rFor we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that
    we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up
    of life. &l5&rNow he'
  '43': 'that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto
    us the earnest of the Spirit. &l6&rTherefore we are always confident, knowing
    that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: &l7&r(For
    we walk by faith, not'
  '44': by sight:) &l8&rWe are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. &l9&rWherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. &l10&rFor we must all appear before the judgment
  '45': seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. &l11&rKnowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made
  '46': manifest in your consciences. &l12&rFor we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. &l13&rFor whether we be beside ourselves,
  '47': 'it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. &l14&rFor the
    love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all,
    then were all dead: &l15&rAnd that he died for all, that they which live should
    not henceforth live'
  '48': 'unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. &l16&rWherefore
    henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after
    the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. &l17&rTherefore if any man
    be in Christ,'
  '49': 'he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are
    become new. &l18&rAnd all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself
    by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; &l19&rTo
    wit, that God was in'
  '50': Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

    &l20&rNow then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by
    us: we pray you in Christ''s stead, be ye reconciled to God. &l21&rFor he hath

    We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the

    the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
    &l5&rIn'

  '6': 'righteousness on the right hand and on the left, &l8&rBy honour and dishonour,
    by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; &l9&rAs unknown, and
    yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
    &l10&rAs'
  '7': sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. &l11&rO ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged. &l12&rYe are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own
  '8': 'bowels. &l13&rNow for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,)
    be ye also enlarged. &l14&rBe ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers:
    for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion
    hath light with'
  '9': darkness? &l15&rAnd what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? &l16&rAnd what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and
  '10': walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. &l17&rWherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you. &l18&rAnd will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be
  '11': my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
  '12': 'Chapter 7

    Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from
    all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
    &l2&rReceive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded
    no'
  '13': 'man. &l3&rI speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye
    are in our hearts to die and live with you. &l4&rGreat is my boldness of speech
    toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding
    joyful in all our'
  '14': tribulation. &l5&rFor, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. &l6&rNevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of
  '15': Titus; &l7&rAnd not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more. &l8&rFor though I made you sorry with a letter,
  '16': 'I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle
    hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season. &l9&rNow I rejoice, not
    that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made
    sorry after a godly'
  '17': 'manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. &l10&rFor godly sorrow
    worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world
    worketh death. &l11&rFor behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a
    godly sort, what'
  '18': carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. &l12&rWherefore,
  '19': 'though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong,
    nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight
    of God might appear unto you. &l13&rTherefore we were comforted in your comfort:
    yea, and exceedingly'
  '20': the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. &l14&rFor if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is
  '21': found a truth. &l15&rAnd his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. &l16&rI rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
  '22': 'Chapter 8

    Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches
    of Macedonia; &l2&rHow that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their
    joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. &l3&rFor'
  '23': to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; &l4&rPraying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. &l5&rAnd this they did, not as
  '24': we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. &l6&rInsomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. &l7&rTherefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and
  '25': utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. &l8&rI speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. &l9&rFor ye know the
  '26': 'grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes
    he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. &l10&rAnd herein I
    give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only
    to do, but also to be'
  '27': forward a year ago. &l11&rNow therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have. &l12&rFor if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath,
  '28': 'and not according to that he hath not. &l13&rFor I mean not that other men
    be eased, and ye burdened: &l14&rBut by an equality, that now at this time your
    abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply
    for your want:'
  '29': 'that there may be equality: &l15&rAs it is written, He that had gathered
    much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack. &l16&rBut
    thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for
    you. &l17&rFor indeed he'
  '30': accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. &l18&rAnd we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches; &l19&rAnd not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches
  '31': 'to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory
    of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind: &l20&rAvoiding this, that
    no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: &l21&rProviding
    for honest'
  '32': things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. &l22&rAnd we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.
  '33': '&l23&rWhether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper
    concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the
    churches, and the glory of Christ. &l24&rWherefore shew ye to them, and before
    the churches, the proof'
  '34': of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
  '35': 'Chapter 9

    For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write
    to you: &l2&rFor I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you
    to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked'
  '36': 'very many. &l3&rYet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should
    be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: &l4&rLest haply if
    they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not,
    ye) should be'
  '37': ashamed in this same confident boasting. &l5&rTherefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of
  '38': bounty, and not as of covetousness. &l6&rBut this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. &l7&rEvery man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not
  '39': 'grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. &l8&rAnd God
    is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency
    in all things, may abound to every good work: &l9&r(As it is written, He hath
    dispersed abroad;'
  '40': 'he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever. &l10&rNow
    he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply
    your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;) &l11&rBeing enriched
    in every'
  '41': thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. &l12&rFor the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; &l13&rWhiles by the experiment of this
  '42': ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; &l14&rAnd by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.
  '43': '&l15&rThanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.'
  '44': 'Chapter 10

    Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in
    presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: &l2&rBut I beseech
    you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith
    I'
  '45': 'think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according
    to the flesh. &l3&rFor though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
    &l4&r(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to
    the pulling down of'
  '46': strong holds;) &l5&rCasting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; &l6&rAnd having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when
  '47': your obedience is fulfilled. &l7&rDo ye look on things after the outward appearance? if any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's. &l8&rFor though I should boast
  '48': 'somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification,
    and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: &l9&rThat I may not seem
    as if I would terrify you by letters. &l10&rFor his letters, say they, are weighty
    and powerful;'
  '49': but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible. &l11&rLet such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present. &l12&rFor we dare not make ourselves of the
  '50': 'number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they
    measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves,
    are not wise.'

  '6': lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. &l4&rFor if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit,
  '7': which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. &l5&rFor I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. &l6&rBut though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been
  '8': throughly made manifest among you in all things. &l7&rHave I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? &l8&rI robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.
  '9': '&l9&rAnd when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man:
    for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied:
    and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will
    I keep myself.'
  '10': '&l10&rAs the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting
    in the regions of Achaia. &l11&rWherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
    &l12&rBut what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which
    desire occasion;'
  '11': that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. &l13&rFor such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. &l14&rAnd no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. &l15&rTherefore
  '12': it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. &l16&rI say again, let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a
  '13': little. &l17&rThat which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. &l18&rSeeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. &l19&rFor ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.
  '14': '&l20&rFor ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you,
    if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.
    &l21&rI speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever
    any is bold, (I'
  '15': speak foolishly,) I am bold also. &l22&rAre they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. &l23&rAre they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure,
  '16': in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. &l24&rOf the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. &l25&rThrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; &l26&rIn journeyings
  '17': often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; &l27&rIn weariness and painfulness, in
  '18': watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. &l28&rBeside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. &l29&rWho is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn
  '19': not? &l30&rIf I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. &l31&rThe God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. &l32&rIn Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept
  '20': 'the city of the damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: &l33&rAnd
    through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.'
  '21': 'Chapter 12

    It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations
    of the Lord. &l2&rI knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in
    the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God'
  '22': 'knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. &l3&rAnd I knew such
    a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
    &l4&rHow that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which
    it is not lawful for a'
  '23': 'man to utter. &l5&rOf such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not
    glory, but in mine infirmities. &l6&rFor though I would desire to glory, I shall
    not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should
    think of me above that'
  '24': which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me. &l7&rAnd lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above
  '25': 'measure. &l8&rFor this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart
    from me. &l9&rAnd he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength
    is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities,
    that'
  '26': 'the power of Christ may rest upon me. &l10&rTherefore I take pleasure in
    infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for
    Christ''s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. &l11&rI am become a fool
    in glorying; ye have'
  '27': 'compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am
    I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing. &l12&rTruly the signs
    of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and
    mighty deeds.'
  '28': '&l13&rFor what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it
    be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong. &l14&rBehold,
    the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you:
    for I seek not yours'
  '29': 'but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents
    for the children. &l15&rAnd I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though
    the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. &l16&rBut be it so, I did
    not burden you:'
  '30': nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile. &l17&rDid I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? &l18&rI desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in
  '31': 'the same steps? &l19&rAgain, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you?
    we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your
    edifying. &l20&rFor I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I
    would, and that I shall be'
  '32': 'found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths,
    strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: &l21&rAnd lest, when I
    come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which
    have sinned already,'
  '33': and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
  '34': 'Chapter 13

    This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses
    shall every word be established. &l2&rI told you before, and foretell you, as
    if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which'
  '35': 'heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not
    spare: &l3&rSince ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward
    is not weak, but is mighty in you. &l4&rFor though he was crucified through weakness,
    yet he liveth by'
  '36': the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you. &l5&rExamine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be
  '37': reprobates? &l6&rBut I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. &l7&rNow I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. &l8&rFor we can do nothing
  '38': 'against the truth, but for the truth. &l9&rFor we are glad, when we are weak,
    and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection. &l10&rTherefore
    I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness,
    according to the'
  '39': power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction. &l11&rFinally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. &l12&rGreet one another with an
  '40': holy kiss. &l13&rAll the saints salute you. &l14&rThe grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.
