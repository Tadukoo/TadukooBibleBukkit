  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and
    not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; &l2&rFor the truth''s
    sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever. &l3&rGrace be with
    you, mercy,'
  '2': and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. &l4&rI rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. &l5&rAnd now I beseech thee,
  '3': lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. &l6&rAnd this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye
  '4': should walk in it. &l7&rFor many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. &l8&rLook to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we
  '5': receive a full reward. &l9&rWhosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. &l10&rIf there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine,
  '6': 'receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: &l11&rFor he that
    biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. &l12&rHaving many things
    to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto
    you, and speak'
  '7': face to face, that our joy may be full. &l13&rThe children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
