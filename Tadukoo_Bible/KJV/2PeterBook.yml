  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained
    like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus
    Christ: &l2&rGrace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God,'
  '2': 'and of Jesus our Lord, &l3&rAccording as his divine power hath given unto
    us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him
    that hath called us to glory and virtue: &l4&rWhereby are given unto us exceeding
    great and precious'
  '3': 'promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having
    escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. &l5&rAnd beside this,
    giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; &l6&rAnd
    to knowledge'
  '4': temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; &l7&rAnd to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. &l8&rFor if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in
  '5': the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. &l9&rBut he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. &l10&rWherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election
  '6': 'sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: &l11&rFor so an entrance
    shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord
    and Saviour Jesus Christ. &l12&rWherefore I will not be negligent to put you always
    in'
  '7': remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth. &l13&rYea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; &l14&rKnowing that shortly I must put off this my
  '8': tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. &l15&rMoreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. &l16&rFor we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you
  '9': the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. &l17&rFor he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
  '10': pleased. &l18&rAnd this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. &l19&rWe have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day
  '11': 'dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: &l20&rKnowing this first, that
    no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. &l21&rFor the prophecy
    came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were
    moved by the'
  '12': Holy Ghost.
  '13': 'Chapter 2

    But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false
    teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying
    the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. &l2&rAnd
    many'
  '14': 'shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall
    be evil spoken of. &l3&rAnd through covetousness shall they with feigned words
    make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and
    their damnation'
  '15': slumbereth not. &l4&rFor if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; &l5&rAnd spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of
  '16': righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; &l6&rAnd turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; &l7&rAnd delivered just
  '17': 'Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: &l8&r(For that righteous
    man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from
    day to day with their unlawful deeds;) &l9&rThe Lord knoweth how to deliver the
    godly out of'
  '18': 'temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:
    &l10&rBut chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and
    despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to
    speak evil of'
  '19': dignities. &l11&rWhereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. &l12&rBut these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not;
  '20': and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; &l13&rAnd shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast
  '21': 'with you; &l14&rHaving eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from
    sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices;
    cursed children: &l15&rWhich have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,
    following the way'
  '22': 'of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; &l16&rBut
    was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man''s voice forbad the
    madness of the prophet. &l17&rThese are wells without water, clouds that are carried
    with a'
  '23': tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. &l18&rFor when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.
  '24': '&l19&rWhile they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of
    corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.
    &l20&rFor if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge
    of the Lord'
  '25': and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. &l21&rFor it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from
  '26': the holy commandment delivered unto them. &l22&rBut it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
  '27': 'Chapter 3

    This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your
    pure minds by way of remembrance: &l2&rThat ye may be mindful of the words which
    were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles'
  '28': 'of the Lord and Saviour: &l3&rKnowing this first, that there shall come in
    the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, &l4&rAnd saying, Where
    is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue
    as they were from'
  '29': 'the beginning of the creation. &l5&rFor this they willingly are ignorant
    of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out
    of the water and in the water: &l6&rWhereby the world that then was, being overflowed
    with water,'
  '30': 'perished: &l7&rBut the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same
    word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition
    of ungodly men. &l8&rBut, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one
    day is with the'
  '31': Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. &l9&rThe Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
  '32': '&l10&rBut the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which
    the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with
    fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
    &l11&rSeeing then'
  '33': that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, &l12&rLooking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements
  '34': shall melt with fervent heat? &l13&rNevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. &l14&rWherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in
  '35': peace, without spot, and blameless. &l15&rAnd account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; &l16&rAs also in all his epistles, speaking in them
  '36': of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. &l17&rYe therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware
  '37': lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. &l18&rBut grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.
