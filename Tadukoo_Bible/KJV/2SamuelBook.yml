  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the
    slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; &l2&rIt came
    even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul
    with'
  '2': 'his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to
    David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance. &l3&rAnd David said unto
    him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel
    am I escaped. &l4&rAnd'
  '3': David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. &l5&rAnd David said unto the young man
  '4': that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? &l6&rAnd the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
  '5': '&l7&rAnd when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered,
    Here am I. &l8&rAnd he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
    Amalekite. &l9&rHe said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me:
    for anguish'
  '6': 'is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me. &l10&rSo I stood upon
    him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was
    fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was
    on his arm, and have'
  '7': 'brought them hither unto my lord. &l11&rThen David took hold on his clothes,
    and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: &l12&rAnd they mourned,
    and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the
    people of the'
  '8': Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. &l13&rAnd David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. &l14&rAnd David said unto him, How wast thou not
  '9': afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the Lord's anointed? &l15&rAnd David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died. &l16&rAnd David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth
  '10': 'hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord''s anointed. &l17&rAnd
    David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: &l18&r(Also
    he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written
    in the'
  '11': 'book of Jasher.) &l19&rThe beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places:
    how are the mighty fallen! &l20&rTell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets
    of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters
    of the'
  '12': 'uncircumcised triumph. &l21&rYe mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew,
    neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield
    of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been
    anointed with oil.'
  '13': ' &l22&rFrom the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of
    Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. &l23&rSaul
    and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they
    were not divided: they'
  '14': were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. &l24&rYe daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. &l25&rHow are the mighty fallen in the midst of the
  '15': 'battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. &l26&rI am distressed
    for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love
    to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. &l27&rHow are the mighty fallen,
    and the weapons'
  '16': of war perished!
  '17': 'Chapter 2

    And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall
    I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the Lord said unto him, Go up. And
    David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron. &l2&rSo David went
    up'
  '18': 'thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal''s
    wife the Carmelite. &l3&rAnd his men that were with him did David bring up, every
    man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. &l4&rAnd the men
    of Judah came,'
  '19': and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul. &l5&rAnd David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the Lord,
  '20': 'that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have
    buried him. &l6&rAnd now the Lord shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also
    will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. &l7&rTherefore
    now let your hands be'
  '21': 'strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the
    house of Judah have anointed me king over them. &l8&rBut Abner the son of Ner,
    captain of Saul''s host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over
    to Mahanaim; &l9&rAnd'
  '22': made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. &l10&rIshbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah
  '23': followed David. &l11&rAnd the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. &l12&rAnd Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. &l13&rAnd Joab the
  '24': 'son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by
    the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and
    the other on the other side of the pool. &l14&rAnd Abner said to Joab, Let the
    young men now arise, and'
  '25': play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. &l15&rThen there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. &l16&rAnd they caught every one his fellow by the head,
  '26': 'and thrust his sword in his fellow''s side; so they fell down together: wherefore
    that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon. &l17&rAnd there was
    a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before
    the servants of'
  '27': 'David. &l18&rAnd there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
    and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe. &l19&rAnd Asahel pursued
    after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from
    following Abner.'
  '28': '&l20&rThen Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered,
    I am. &l21&rAnd Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy
    left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But
    Asahel would not'
  '29': 'turn aside from following of him. &l22&rAnd Abner said again to Asahel, Turn
    thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how
    then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother? &l23&rHowbeit he refused to
    turn aside: wherefore'
  '30': 'Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that
    the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place:
    and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down
    and died stood'
  '31': 'still. &l24&rJoab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went
    down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way
    of the wilderness of Gibeon. &l25&rAnd the children of Benjamin gathered themselves
    together after'
  '32': Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill. &l26&rThen Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people
  '33': return from following their brethren? &l27&rAnd Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother. &l28&rSo Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
  '34': 'pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. &l29&rAnd Abner
    and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and
    went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim. &l30&rAnd Joab returned from
    following Abner:'
  '35': and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel. &l31&rBut the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died. &l32&rAnd they took up
  '36': Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.
  '37': 'Chapter 3

    Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David
    waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker. &l2&rAnd
    unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam'
  '38': the Jezreelitess; &l3&rAnd his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; &l4&rAnd the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son
  '39': of Abital; &l5&rAnd the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron. &l6&rAnd it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
  '40': '&l7&rAnd Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah:
    and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father''s concubine?
    &l8&rThen was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog''s
    head, which'
  '41': against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman? &l9&rSo do God to Abner,
  '42': and more also, except, as the Lord hath sworn to David, even so I do to him; &l10&rTo translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba. &l11&rAnd he could not answer
  '43': Abner a word again, because he feared him. &l12&rAnd Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee. &l13&rAnd he
  '44': 'said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee,
    that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul''s daughter,
    when thou comest to see my face. &l14&rAnd David sent messengers to Ishbosheth
    Saul''s son,'
  '45': saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines. &l15&rAnd Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish. &l16&rAnd her husband went with her along weeping behind
  '46': 'her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned. &l17&rAnd
    Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David
    in times past to be king over you: &l18&rNow then do it: for the Lord hath spoken
    of David,'
  '47': 'saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out
    of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies. &l19&rAnd
    Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the
    ears of David in'
  '48': Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin. &l20&rSo Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. &l21&rAnd Abner said unto David, I
  '49': will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace. &l22&rAnd, behold, the servants of
  '50': 'David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with
    them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he
    was gone in peace.'

    &l23&rWhen Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab,
    saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and
    he is gone in peace. &l24&rThen Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou'
  '2': done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? &l25&rThou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest. &l26&rAnd
  '3': 'when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought
    him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not. &l27&rAnd when Abner
    was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly,
    and smote him'
  '4': 'there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
    &l28&rAnd afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless
    before the Lord for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner: &l29&rLet it
    rest on the head of'
  '5': Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread. &l30&rSo Joab, and Abishai his brother slew
  '6': Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. &l31&rAnd David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the
  '7': 'bier. &l32&rAnd they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice,
    and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. &l33&rAnd the king lamented
    over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth? &l34&rThy hands were not bound,
    nor thy'
  '8': 'feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou.
    And all the people wept again over him. &l35&rAnd when all the people came to
    cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to
    me, and more also, if'
  '9': 'I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down. &l36&rAnd all the people
    took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all
    the people. &l37&rFor all the people and all Israel understood that day that it
    was not of the king'
  '10': 'to slay Abner the son of Ner. &l38&rAnd the king said unto his servants,
    Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
    &l39&rAnd I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of
    Zeruiah be too hard for me:'
  '11': the Lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.
  '12': 'Chapter 4

    And when Saul''s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble,
    and all the Israelites were troubled. &l2&rAnd Saul''s son had two men that were
    captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,'
  '13': 'the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth
    also was reckoned to Benjamin. &l3&rAnd the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were
    sojourners there until this day.) &l4&rAnd Jonathan, Saul''s son, had a son that
    was lame of his'
  '14': 'feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out
    of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made
    haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth. &l5&rAnd
    the sons of'
  '15': Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon. &l6&rAnd they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him
  '16': 'under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. &l7&rFor
    when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote
    him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through
    the plain all'
  '17': night. &l8&rAnd they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the Lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
  '18': '&l9&rAnd David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon
    the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the Lord liveth, who hath redeemed my soul
    out of all adversity, &l10&rWhen one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking
    to have brought'
  '19': 'good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that
    I would have given him a reward for his tidings: &l11&rHow much more, when wicked
    men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore
    now require'
  '20': his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? &l12&rAnd David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it
  '21': in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.
  '22': 'Chapter 5

    Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold,
    we are thy bone and thy flesh. &l2&rAlso in time past, when Saul was king over
    us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord said
    to'
  '23': 'thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over
    Israel. &l3&rSo all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king
    David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they anointed David
    king over Israel.'
  '24': '&l4&rDavid was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty
    years. &l5&rIn Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in
    Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah. &l6&rAnd
    the king and his men'
  '25': 'went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which
    spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt
    not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither. &l7&rNevertheless David
    took the strong'
  '26': 'hold of Zion: the same is the city of David. &l8&rAnd David said on that
    day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame
    and the blind that are hated of David''s soul, he shall be chief and captain.
    Wherefore they said, The'
  '27': blind and the lame shall not come into the house. &l9&rSo David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. &l10&rAnd David went on, and grew great, and the Lord God of hosts was with him.
  '28': '&l11&rAnd Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and
    carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house. &l12&rAnd David perceived
    that the Lord had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his
    kingdom for his'
  '29': 'people Israel''s sake. &l13&rAnd David took him more concubines and wives
    out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters
    born to David. &l14&rAnd these be the names of those that were born unto him in
    Jerusalem;'
  '30': Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, &l15&rIbhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, &l16&rAnd Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet. &l17&rBut when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines
  '31': came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold. &l18&rThe Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. &l19&rAnd David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them
  '32': 'into mine hand? And the Lord said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless
    deliver the Philistines into thine hand. &l20&rAnd David came to Baalperazim,
    and David smote them there, and said, The Lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies
    before me, as the'
  '33': breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim. &l21&rAnd there they left their images, and David and his men burned them. &l22&rAnd the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. &l23&rAnd when
  '34': David enquired of the Lord, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. &l24&rAnd let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou
  '35': 'shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the Lord go out before thee, to smite
    the host of the Philistines. &l25&rAnd David did so, as the Lord had commanded
    him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.'
  '36': 'Chapter 6

    Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
    &l2&rAnd David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale
    of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the
    name of'
  '37': 'the Lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims. &l3&rAnd they set
    the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that
    was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. &l4&rAnd
    they brought it'
  '38': 'out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of
    God: and Ahio went before the ark. &l5&rAnd David and all the house of Israel
    played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on
    harps, and on psalteries,'
  '39': and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals. &l6&rAnd when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. &l7&rAnd the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God
  '40': 'smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God. &l8&rAnd
    David was displeased, because the Lord had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called
    the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day. &l9&rAnd David was afraid of the
    Lord that day,'
  '41': 'and said, How shall the ark of the Lord come to me? &l10&rSo David would
    not remove the ark of the Lord unto him into the city of David: but David carried
    it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. &l11&rAnd the ark of the Lord
    continued in the house'
  '42': 'of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the Lord blessed Obededom, and
    all his household. &l12&rAnd it was told king David, saying, The Lord hath blessed
    the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of
    God. So David went'
  '43': and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness. &l13&rAnd it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. &l14&rAnd David danced before the Lord
  '44': with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. &l15&rSo David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. &l16&rAnd as the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, Michal
  '45': Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart. &l17&rAnd they brought in the ark of the Lord, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had
  '46': 'pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before
    the Lord. &l18&rAnd as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings
    and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts. &l19&rAnd
    he dealt'
  '47': among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house. &l20&rThen David returned to
  '48': bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth
  '49': 'himself! &l21&rAnd David said unto Michal, It was before the Lord, which
    chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over
    the people of the Lord, over Israel: therefore will I play before the Lord. &l22&rAnd
    I will yet be more'
  '50': 'vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants
    which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour. &l23&rTherefore Michal
    the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.'

    And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him
    rest round about from all his enemies; &l2&rThat the king said unto Nathan the
    prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God'
  '2': dwelleth within curtains. &l3&rAnd Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the Lord is with thee. &l4&rAnd it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan, saying, &l5&rGo and tell my servant David, Thus saith
  '3': the Lord, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in? &l6&rWhereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. &l7&rIn all the
  '4': places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar? &l8&rNow therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant
  '5': 'David, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from
    following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: &l9&rAnd I was with
    thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy
    sight, and have made'
  '6': thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth. &l10&rMoreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of
  '7': wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime, &l11&rAnd as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the Lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house. &l12&rAnd
  '8': when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. &l13&rHe shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his
  '9': 'kingdom for ever. &l14&rI will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he
    commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes
    of the children of men: &l15&rBut my mercy shall not depart away from him, as
    I took it from Saul,'
  '10': 'whom I put away before thee. &l16&rAnd thine house and thy kingdom shall
    be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
    &l17&rAccording to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan
    speak unto David.'
  '11': '&l18&rThen went king David in, and sat before the Lord, and he said, Who
    am I, O Lord God? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? &l19&rAnd
    this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God; but thou hast spoken also
    of thy servant''s'
  '12': house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord God? &l20&rAnd what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord God, knowest thy servant. &l21&rFor thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great
  '13': 'things, to make thy servant know them. &l22&rWherefore thou art great, O
    Lord God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according
    to all that we have heard with our ears. &l23&rAnd what one nation in the earth
    is like thy'
  '14': people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
  '15': '&l24&rFor thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people
    unto thee for ever: and thou, Lord, art become their God. &l25&rAnd now, O Lord
    God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his
    house, establish it for'
  '16': 'ever, and do as thou hast said. &l26&rAnd let thy name be magnified for ever,
    saying, The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant
    David be established before thee. &l27&rFor thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel,
    hast revealed'
  '17': 'to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant
    found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee. &l28&rAnd now, O Lord God, thou
    art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto
    thy servant:'
  '18': '&l29&rTherefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant,
    that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord God, hast spoken it:

    And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them:
    and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines. &l2&rAnd he smote
    Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with'
  '20': two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts. &l3&rDavid smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river
  '21': 'Euphrates. &l4&rAnd David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
    horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses,
    but reserved of them for an hundred chariots. &l5&rAnd when the Syrians of Damascus
    came to'
  '22': 'succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty
    thousand men. &l6&rThen David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
    became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever
    he went.'
  '23': '&l7&rAnd David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer,
    and brought them to Jerusalem. &l8&rAnd from Betah, and from Berothai, cities
    of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass. &l9&rWhen Toi king of Hamath
    heard that David'
  '24': 'had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, &l10&rThen Toi sent Joram his son
    unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against
    Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought
    with him vessels of'
  '25': 'silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: &l11&rWhich also king
    David did dedicate unto the Lord, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated
    of all nations which he subdued; &l12&rOf Syria, and of Moab, and of the children
    of Ammon, and of the'
  '26': Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. &l13&rAnd David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men. &l14&rAnd he put garrisons in Edom;
  '27': throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went. &l15&rAnd David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people. &l16&rAnd Joab the
  '28': son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; &l17&rAnd Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe; &l18&rAnd Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the
  '29': Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

    And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may
    shew him kindness for Jonathan''s sake? &l2&rAnd there was of the house of Saul
    a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king
    said'
  '31': unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he. &l3&rAnd the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.
  '32': '&l4&rAnd the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king,
    Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar. &l5&rThen
    king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel,
    from Lodebar. &l6&rNow'
  '33': 'when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David,
    he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered,
    Behold thy servant! &l7&rAnd David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely
    shew thee'
  '34': kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. &l8&rAnd he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I
  '35': am? &l9&rThen the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house. &l10&rThou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt
  '36': 'bring in the fruits, that thy master''s son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth
    thy master''s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons
    and twenty servants. &l11&rThen said Ziba unto the king, According to all that
    my lord the king'
  '37': hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons. &l12&rAnd Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were
  '38': 'servants unto Mephibosheth. &l13&rSo Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for
    he did eat continually at the king''s table; and was lame on both his feet.'
  '39': 'Chapter 10

    And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and
    Hanun his son reigned in his stead. &l2&rThen said David, I will shew kindness
    unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David
    sent'
  '40': to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. &l3&rAnd the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he
  '41': hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it? &l4&rWherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their
  '42': 'garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. &l5&rWhen
    they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed:
    and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
    &l6&rAnd'
  '43': when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men. &l7&rAnd when
  '44': 'David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. &l8&rAnd
    the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in
    of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were
    by themselves in'
  '45': 'the field. &l9&rWhen Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him
    before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array
    against the Syrians: &l10&rAnd the rest of the people he delivered into the hand
    of Abishai his'
  '46': 'brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon. &l11&rAnd
    he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if
    the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
    &l12&rBe of good'
  '47': 'courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our
    God: and the Lord do that which seemeth him good. &l13&rAnd Joab drew nigh, and
    the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled
    before him.'
  '48': '&l14&rAnd when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then
    fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from
    the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem. &l15&rAnd when the Syrians saw that
    they were smitten'
  '49': 'before Israel, they gathered themselves together. &l16&rAnd Hadarezer sent,
    and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam;
    and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them. &l17&rAnd when
    it was told David,'
  '50': he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.

    And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth
    to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and
    they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still'
  '4': 'at Jerusalem. &l2&rAnd it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose
    from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king''s house: and from the
    roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look
    upon. &l3&rAnd David sent'
  '5': 'and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter
    of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? &l4&rAnd David sent messengers, and took
    her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from
    her uncleanness:'
  '6': and she returned unto her house. &l5&rAnd the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child. &l6&rAnd David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David. &l7&rAnd when Uriah was come unto him, David
  '7': demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered. &l8&rAnd David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.
  '8': '&l9&rBut Uriah slept at the door of the king''s house with all the servants
    of his lord, and went not down to his house. &l10&rAnd when they had told David,
    saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou
    not from thy journey?'
  '9': why then didst thou not go down unto thine house? &l11&rAnd Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and
  '10': to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing. &l12&rAnd David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
  '11': '&l13&rAnd when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and
    he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants
    of his lord, but went not down to his house. &l14&rAnd it came to pass in the
    morning, that David wrote'
  '12': a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. &l15&rAnd he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die. &l16&rAnd it came to pass, when Joab observed the
  '13': 'city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men
    were. &l17&rAnd the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there
    fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
    &l18&rThen Joab sent'
  '14': and told David all the things concerning the war; &l19&rAnd charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king, &l20&rAnd if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore
  '15': approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall? &l21&rWho smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went
  '16': ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. &l22&rSo the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for. &l23&rAnd the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out
  '17': unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate. &l24&rAnd the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. &l25&rThen David
  '18': 'said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing
    displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle
    more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him. &l26&rAnd
    when the wife of'
  '19': Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. &l27&rAnd when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord.

    And the Lord sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him,
    There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor. &l2&rThe rich
    man had exceeding many flocks and herds: &l3&rBut the poor man had nothing, save
    one'
  '21': 'little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together
    with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his
    own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. &l4&rAnd there
    came a traveller unto'
  '22': the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him. &l5&rAnd David's anger was greatly kindled
  '23': 'against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, the man that
    hath done this thing shall surely die: &l6&rAnd he shall restore the lamb fourfold,
    because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. &l7&rAnd Nathan said to
    David, Thou art the'
  '24': man. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; &l8&rAnd I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if
  '25': that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. &l9&rWherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be
  '26': thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. &l10&rNow therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. &l11&rThus saith the Lord,
  '27': 'Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will
    take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall
    lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. &l12&rFor thou didst it secretly:
    but I will do this'
  '28': thing before all Israel, and before the sun. &l13&rAnd David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said unto David, The Lord also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. &l14&rHowbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great
  '29': occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. &l15&rAnd Nathan departed unto his house. And the Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick. &l16&rDavid therefore
  '30': 'besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night
    upon the earth. &l17&rAnd the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise
    him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. &l18&rAnd
    it came'
  '31': 'to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David
    feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child
    was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how
    will he then vex'
  '32': 'himself, if we tell him that the child is dead? &l19&rBut when David saw
    that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore
    David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. &l20&rThen
    David arose from'
  '33': 'the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and
    came into the house of the Lord, and worshipped: then he came to his own house;
    and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. &l21&rThen said
    his servants unto'
  '34': 'him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for
    the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and
    eat bread. &l22&rAnd he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
    for I said, Who can'
  '35': tell whether God will be gracious to me, that the child may live? &l23&rBut now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. &l24&rAnd David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in
  '36': 'unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon:
    and the Lord loved him. &l25&rAnd he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and
    he called his name Jedidiah, because of the Lord. &l26&rAnd Joab fought against
    Rabbah of the'
  '37': children of Ammon, and took the royal city. &l27&rAnd Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters. &l28&rNow therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and
  '38': 'take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name. &l29&rAnd
    David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against
    it, and took it. &l30&rAnd he took their king''s crown from off his head, the
    weight whereof was a talent'
  '39': 'of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David''s head. And he
    brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance. &l31&rAnd he brought forth
    the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron,
    and under axes of'
  '40': 'iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all
    the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto
    Jerusalem.'

    And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister,
    whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. &l2&rAnd Amnon was
    so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon'
  '42': 'thought it hard for him to do anything to her. &l3&rBut Amnon had a friend,
    whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David''s brother: and Jonadab was a
    very subtil man. &l4&rAnd he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king''s son,
    lean from day to day?'
  '43': 'wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother
    Absalom''s sister. &l5&rAnd Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and
    make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray
    thee, let my sister'

    let Tamar my sister come,'
  '45': and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand. &l7&rThen David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat. &l8&rSo Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took
  '46': flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. &l9&rAnd she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him. &l10&rAnd Amnon said
  '47': unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. &l11&rAnd when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and
  '48': 'said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister. &l12&rAnd she answered him, Nay,
    my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do
    not thou this folly. &l13&rAnd I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as
    for thee, thou shalt'
  '49': 'be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto
    the king; for he will not withhold me from thee. &l14&rHowbeit he would not hearken
    unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her. &l15&rThen
    Amnon hated'
  '50': her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

    &l16&rAnd she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is
    greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto
    her. &l17&rThen he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put
    now'
  '2': 'this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her. &l18&rAnd she had a garment
    of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king''s daughters that
    were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door
    after her.'
  '3': '&l19&rAnd Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours
    that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying. &l20&rAnd
    Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but
    hold now thy peace, my'
  '4': 'sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate
    in her brother Absalom''s house. &l21&rBut when king David heard of all these
    things, he was very wroth. &l22&rAnd Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither
    good nor bad: for'
  '5': 'Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. &l23&rAnd it
    came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor,
    which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king''s sons. &l24&rAnd Absalom
    came to the king,'
  '6': 'and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech
    thee, and his servants go with thy servant. &l25&rAnd the king said to Absalom,
    Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed
    him: howbeit'
  '7': he would not go, but blessed him. &l26&rThen said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee? &l27&rBut Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
  '8': '&l28&rNow Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon''s
    heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him,
    fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant. &l29&rAnd the
    servants of'
  '9': Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled. &l30&rAnd it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's
  '10': sons, and there is not one of them left. &l31&rThen the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. &l32&rAnd Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my
  '11': 'lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king''s sons; for
    Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined
    from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. &l33&rNow therefore let not my lord
    the king take the'
  '12': 'thing to his heart, to think that all the king''s sons are dead: for Amnon
    only is dead. &l34&rBut Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
    up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the
    hill side behind'
  '13': 'him. &l35&rAnd Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king''s sons come:
    as thy servant said, so it is. &l36&rAnd it came to pass, as soon as he had made
    an end of speaking, that, behold, the king''s sons came, and lifted up their voice
    and wept: and the'
  '14': king also and all his servants wept very sore. &l37&rBut Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day. &l38&rSo Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. &l39&rAnd the soul
  '15': 'of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning
    Amnon, seeing he was dead.'
  '16': 'Chapter 14

    Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king''s heart was toward Absalom.
    &l2&rAnd Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her,
    I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and'
  '17': 'anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned
    for the dead: &l3&rAnd come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So
    Joab put the words in her mouth. &l4&rAnd when the woman of Tekoah spake to the
    king, she fell on her'
  '18': face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king. &l5&rAnd the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead. &l6&rAnd thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the
  '19': field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him. &l7&rAnd, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom
  '20': 'he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal
    which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon
    the earth. &l8&rAnd the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will
    give charge'
  '21': 'concerning thee. &l9&rAnd the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord,
    O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father''s house: and the king and his
    throne be guiltless. &l10&rAnd the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring
    him to me, and he'
  '22': shall not touch thee any more. &l11&rThen said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the Lord thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the Lord liveth, there shall not
  '23': one hair of thy son fall to the earth. &l12&rThen the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on. &l13&rAnd the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God?
  '24': 'for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king
    doth not fetch home again his banished. &l14&rFor we must needs die, and are as
    water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God
    respect any person:'
  '25': 'yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him. &l15&rNow
    therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because
    the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the
    king; it'
  '26': may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid. &l16&rFor the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. &l17&rThen thine handmaid said, The
  '27': 'word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God,
    so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the Lord thy God will
    be with thee. &l18&rThen the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from
    me, I pray thee,'
  '28': the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak. &l19&rAnd the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right
  '29': 'hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy
    servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:
    &l20&rTo fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing:
    and my lord is'
  '30': 'wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that
    are in the earth. &l21&rAnd the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this
    thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again. &l22&rAnd Joab fell to
    the ground on his'
  '31': 'face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy
    servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that
    the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant. &l23&rSo Joab arose and went
    to Geshur, and brought'
  '32': Absalom to Jerusalem. &l24&rAnd the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face. &l25&rBut in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his
  '33': 'beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was
    no blemish in him. &l26&rAnd when he polled his head, (for it was at every year''s
    end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled
    it:) he weighed the'
  '34': 'hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king''s weight. &l27&rAnd
    unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar:
    she was a woman of a fair countenance. &l28&rSo Absalom dwelt two full years in
    Jerusalem, and saw'
  '35': 'not the king''s face. &l29&rTherefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent
    him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second
    time, he would not come. &l30&rTherefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab''s
    field is near mine,'
  '36': and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire. &l31&rThen Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire? &l32&rAnd Absalom answered Joab,
  '37': 'Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the
    king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have
    been there still: now therefore let me see the king''s face; and if there be any
    iniquity in me, let'
  '38': 'him kill me. &l33&rSo Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had
    called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the
    ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.'
  '39': 'Chapter 15

    And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses,
    and fifty men to run before him. &l2&rAnd Absalom rose up early, and stood beside
    the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came
    to'
  '40': the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. &l3&rAnd Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king
  '41': to hear thee. &l4&rAbsalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! &l5&rAnd it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put
  '42': 'forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him. &l6&rAnd on this manner did
    Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the
    hearts of the men of Israel. &l7&rAnd it came to pass after forty years, that
    Absalom said unto the'
  '43': king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the Lord, in Hebron. &l8&rFor thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the Lord shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord. &l9&rAnd
  '44': the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. &l10&rBut Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. &l11&rAnd with
  '45': Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. &l12&rAnd Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered
  '46': sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. &l13&rAnd there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. &l14&rAnd David said unto all his servants that were with
  '47': 'him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from
    Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon
    us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. &l15&rAnd the king''s servants
    said unto the'
  '48': king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint. &l16&rAnd the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house. &l17&rAnd the king went forth, and
  '49': all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off. &l18&rAnd all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the
  '50': 'king. &l19&rThen said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
    also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger,
    and also an exile.'

    &l20&rWhereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and
    down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren:
    mercy and truth be with thee. &l21&rAnd Ittai answered the king, and said, As'
  '2': the Lord liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be. &l22&rAnd David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his
  '3': 'men, and all the little ones that were with him. &l23&rAnd all the country
    wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself
    passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of
    the wilderness.'
  '4': '&l24&rAnd lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark
    of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up,
    until all the people had done passing out of the city. &l25&rAnd the king said
    unto Zadok, Carry'
  '5': 'back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the
    Lord, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation: &l26&rBut
    if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me
    as seemeth good'
  '6': unto him. &l27&rThe king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. &l28&rSee, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
  '7': 'come word from you to certify me. &l29&rZadok therefore and Abiathar carried
    the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there. &l30&rAnd David went
    up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered,
    and he went'
  '8': 'barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head,
    and they went up, weeping as they went up. &l31&rAnd one told David, saying, Ahithophel
    is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Lord, I pray thee, turn
    the counsel'
  '9': 'of Ahithophel into foolishness. &l32&rAnd it came to pass, that when David
    was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the
    Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: &l33&rUnto
    whom David said, If'
  '10': 'thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: &l34&rBut if
    thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king;
    as I have been thy father''s servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant:
    then mayest thou for'
  '11': me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. &l35&rAnd hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
  '12': '&l36&rBehold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok''s
    son, and Jonathan Abiathar''s son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing
    that ye can hear. &l37&rSo Hushai David''s friend came into the city, and Absalom
    came into Jerusalem.'
  '13': 'Chapter 16

    And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant
    of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred
    loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer'
  '14': fruits, and a bottle of wine. &l2&rAnd the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the
  '15': 'wilderness may drink. &l3&rAnd the king said, And where is thy master''s
    son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said,
    To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. &l4&rThen
    said the king to Ziba,'
  '16': Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king. &l5&rAnd when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul,
  '17': 'whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as
    he came. &l6&rAnd he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David:
    and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
    &l7&rAnd thus'
  '18': 'said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou
    man of Belial: &l8&rThe Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house
    of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom
    into the hand of'
  '19': 'Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou
    art a bloody man. &l9&rThen said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why
    should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and
    take off his head.'
  '20': '&l10&rAnd the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?
    so let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall
    then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? &l11&rAnd David said to Abishai, and to
    all his servants, Behold,'
  '21': 'my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now
    may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath
    bidden him. &l12&rIt may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction, and that
    the Lord will requite'
  '22': me good for his cursing this day. &l13&rAnd as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. &l14&rAnd the king, and all the people that were with
  '23': him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there. &l15&rAnd Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. &l16&rAnd it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai
  '24': said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king. &l17&rAnd Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? &l18&rAnd Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the Lord, and this people, and all the
  '25': men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide. &l19&rAnd again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence. &l20&rThen said Absalom to
  '26': 'Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do. &l21&rAnd Ahithophel
    said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father''s concubines, which he hath left to
    keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father:
    then shall the hands of'
  '27': all that are with thee be strong. &l22&rSo they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. &l23&rAnd the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if
  '28': 'a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel
    both with David and with Absalom.'
  '29': 'Chapter 17

    Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men,
    and I will arise and pursue after David this night: &l2&rAnd I will come upon
    him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people'
  '30': 'that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only: &l3&rAnd I
    will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all
    returned: so all the people shall be in peace. &l4&rAnd the saying pleased Absalom
    well, and all the'
  '31': 'elders of Israel. &l5&rThen said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also,
    and let us hear likewise what he saith. &l6&rAnd when Hushai was come to Absalom,
    Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall
    we do after his'
  '32': saying? if not; speak thou. &l7&rAnd Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time. &l8&rFor, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a
  '33': 'bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and
    will not lodge with the people. &l9&rBehold, he is hid now in some pit, or in
    some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at
    the first, that'
  '34': 'whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that
    follow Absalom. &l10&rAnd he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart
    of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty
    man, and they which'
  '35': be with him are valiant men. &l11&rTherefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. &l12&rSo shall we come upon
  '36': 'him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as
    the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him
    there shall not be left so much as one. &l13&rMoreover, if he be gotten into a
    city, then shall all'
  '37': Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there. &l14&rAnd Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the Lord
  '38': had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom. &l15&rThen said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and
  '39': thus and thus have I counselled. &l16&rNow therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him. &l17&rNow Jonathan
  '40': 'and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the
    city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David. &l18&rNevertheless
    a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and
    came to a'
  '41': man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down. &l19&rAnd the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known. &l20&rAnd when Absalom's servants came to the
  '42': woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. &l21&rAnd it came to pass, after they were
  '43': 'departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David,
    and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel
    counselled against you. &l22&rThen David arose, and all the people that were with
    him, and they'
  '44': 'passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that
    was not gone over Jordan. &l23&rAnd when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not
    followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his
    city, and put his'
  '45': household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. &l24&rThen David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. &l25&rAnd Absalom made Amasa captain of the host
  '46': 'instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man''s son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite,
    that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab''s mother.
    &l26&rSo Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead. &l27&rAnd it came to
    pass, when'
  '47': David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, &l28&rBrought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and
  '48': 'flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse, &l29&rAnd
    honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people
    that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and
    thirsty, in the'
  '49': wilderness.
  '50': 'Chapter 18

    And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands,
    and captains of hundreds over them.'

    &l2&rAnd David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and
    a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab''s brother, and
    a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the'
  '2': 'people, I will surely go forth with you myself also. &l3&rBut the people answered,
    Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither
    if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand
    of us:'
  '3': therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city. &l4&rAnd the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands. &l5&rAnd the king commanded
  '4': 'Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young
    man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains
    charge concerning Absalom. &l6&rSo the people went out into the field against
    Israel: and the'
  '5': 'battle was in the wood of Ephraim; &l7&rWhere the people of Israel were slain
    before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of
    twenty thousand men. &l8&rFor the battle was there scattered over the face of
    all the country: and'
  '6': the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. &l9&rAnd Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up
  '7': between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away. &l10&rAnd a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. &l11&rAnd Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and
  '8': why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle. &l12&rAnd the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand
  '9': 'against the king''s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai
    and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. &l13&rOtherwise
    I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter
    hid from the king,'
  '10': and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me. &l14&rThen said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. &l15&rAnd ten
  '11': 'young men that bare Joab''s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and
    slew him. &l16&rAnd Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
    after Israel: for Joab held back the people. &l17&rAnd they took Absalom, and
    cast him into a great'
  '12': 'pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel
    fled every one to his tent. &l18&rNow Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared
    up for himself a pillar, which is in the king''s dale: for he said, I have no
    son to keep my'
  '13': 'name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it
    is called unto this day, Absalom''s place. &l19&rThen said Ahimaaz the son of
    Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the Lord hath avenged
    him of his enemies.'
  '14': '&l20&rAnd Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou
    shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because
    the king''s son is dead. &l21&rThen said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what
    thou hast seen. And'
  '15': Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran. &l22&rThen said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? &l23&rBut
  '16': 'howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran
    by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi. &l24&rAnd David sat between the two
    gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted
    up his eyes, and'
  '17': 'looked, and behold a man running alone. &l25&rAnd the watchman cried, and
    told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth.
    And he came apace, and drew near. &l26&rAnd the watchman saw another man running:
    and the watchman'
  '18': called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. &l27&rAnd the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is
  '19': a good man, and cometh with good tidings. &l28&rAnd Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the Lord thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up
  '20': their hand against my lord the king. &l29&rAnd the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was. &l30&rAnd the king said unto him,
  '21': 'Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still. &l31&rAnd,
    behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the Lord hath
    avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee. &l32&rAnd the king
    said unto Cushi,'
  '22': 'Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord
    the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man
    is. &l33&rAnd the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate,
    and wept: and as he'
  '23': went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
  '24': 'Chapter 19

    And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom. &l2&rAnd
    the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people
    heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son. &l3&rAnd the people gat'
  '25': them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. &l4&rBut the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! &l5&rAnd Joab came into the house to
  '26': the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; &l6&rIn that thou lovest thine
  '27': 'enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou
    regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom
    had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well. &l7&rNow
    therefore arise,'
  '28': 'go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the Lord,
    if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that
    will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until
    now. &l8&rThen the'
  '29': 'king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying,
    Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king:
    for Israel had fled every man to his tent. &l9&rAnd all the people were at strife
    throughout all the'
  '30': tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom. &l10&rAnd Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
  '31': therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back? &l11&rAnd king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all
  '32': 'Israel is come to the king, even to his house. &l12&rYe are my brethren,
    ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the
    king? &l13&rAnd say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God
    do so to me, and more'
  '33': also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab. &l14&rAnd he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants. &l15&rSo
  '34': the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan. &l16&rAnd Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
  '35': '&l17&rAnd there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant
    of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and
    they went over Jordan before the king. &l18&rAnd there went over a ferry boat
    to carry over the'
  '36': king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; &l19&rAnd said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did
  '37': 'perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the
    king should take it to his heart. &l20&rFor thy servant doth know that I have
    sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph
    to go down to meet my'
  '38': lord the king. &l21&rBut Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord's anointed? &l22&rAnd David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be
  '39': adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel? &l23&rTherefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him. &l24&rAnd Mephibosheth the son
  '40': of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace. &l25&rAnd it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
  '41': 'king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?
    &l26&rAnd he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant
    said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because
    thy'
  '42': 'servant is lame. &l27&rAnd he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the
    king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in
    thine eyes. &l28&rFor all of my father''s house were but dead men before my lord
    the king: yet didst'
  '43': thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king? &l29&rAnd the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
  '44': '&l30&rAnd Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch
    as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house. &l31&rAnd Barzillai
    the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct
    him over'
  '45': 'Jordan. &l32&rNow Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old:
    and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was
    a very great man. &l33&rAnd the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with
    me, and I will feed'
  '46': 'thee with me in Jerusalem. &l34&rAnd Barzillai said unto the king, How long
    have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem? &l35&rI am this
    day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant
    taste what I eat'
  '47': 'or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing
    women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
    &l36&rThy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should
    the king recompense'
  '48': it me with such a reward? &l37&rLet thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him
  '49': 'what shall seem good unto thee. &l38&rAnd the king answered, Chimham shall
    go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and
    whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee. &l39&rAnd all the
    people went over'
  '50': Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.

    &l40&rThen the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the
    people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel. &l41&rAnd,
    behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why'
  '2': 'have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the
    king, and his household, and all David''s men with him, over Jordan? &l42&rAnd

    And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son
    of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David,
    neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.'
  '6': '&l2&rSo every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the
    son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to
    Jerusalem. &l3&rAnd David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the
    ten women his'
  '7': concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood. &l4&rThen said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within
  '8': 'three days, and be thou here present. &l5&rSo Amasa went to assemble the men
    of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
    &l6&rAnd David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm
    than did Absalom:'
  '9': 'take thou thy lord''s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced
    cities, and escape us. &l7&rAnd there went out after him Joab''s men, and the
    Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of
    Jerusalem, to pursue'
  '10': after Sheba the son of Bichri. &l8&rWhen they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof;
  '11': 'and as he went forth it fell out. &l9&rAnd Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in
    health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss
    him. &l10&rBut Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab''s hand: so he
    smote him therewith in'
  '12': the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. &l11&rAnd one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is
  '13': for David, let him go after Joab. &l12&rAnd Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one
  '14': 'that came by him stood still. &l13&rWhen he was removed out of the highway,
    all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. &l14&rAnd
    he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all
    the Berites:'
  '15': 'and they were gathered together, and went also after him. &l15&rAnd they
    came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against
    the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered
    the wall, to throw'
  '16': it down. &l16&rThen cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee. &l17&rAnd when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said
  '17': 'unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear. &l18&rThen
    she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely
    ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter. &l19&rI am one of them that
    are'
  '18': 'peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother
    in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the Lord? &l20&rAnd Joab
    answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
    &l21&rThe'
  '19': 'matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by
    name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him
    only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his
    head shall be thrown'
  '20': to thee over the wall. &l22&rThen the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab
  '21': 'returned to Jerusalem unto the king. &l23&rNow Joab was over all the host
    of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the
    Pelethites: &l24&rAnd Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of
    Ahilud was recorder:'
  '22': '&l25&rAnd Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests: &l26&rAnd

  '23': 'Chapter 21

    Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and
    David enquired of the Lord. And the Lord answered, It is for Saul, and for his
    bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites. &l2&rAnd the king called the Gibeonites,'
  '24': 'and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel,
    but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto
    them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
    &l3&rWherefore'
  '25': David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the Lord? &l4&rAnd the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for
  '26': us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you. &l5&rAnd they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,
  '27': '&l6&rLet seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them
    up unto the Lord in Gibeah of Saul, whom the Lord did choose. And the king said,
    I will give them. &l7&rBut the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the
    son of Saul,'
  '28': because of the Lord's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. &l8&rBut the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of
  '29': 'Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
    &l9&rAnd he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them
    in the hill before the Lord: and they fell all seven together, and were put to
    death in the days of'
  '30': harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest. &l10&rAnd Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the
  '31': birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. &l11&rAnd it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. &l12&rAnd David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son
  '32': 'from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan,
    where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in
    Gilboa: &l13&rAnd he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of
    Jonathan his son;'
  '33': 'and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. &l14&rAnd the bones
    of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah,
    in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded.
    And after that God'
  '34': 'was intreated for the land. &l15&rMoreover the Philistines had yet war again
    with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against
    the Philistines: and David waxed faint. &l16&rAnd Ishbibenob, which was of the
    sons of the giant,'
  '35': the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David. &l17&rBut Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David
  '36': 'sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that
    thou quench not the light of Israel. &l18&rAnd it came to pass after this, that
    there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite
    slew Saph, which'
  '37': was of the sons of the giant. &l19&rAnd there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. &l20&rAnd there
  '38': was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. &l21&rAnd when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
  '39': brother of David slew him. &l22&rThese four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
  '40': 'Chapter 22

    And David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord
    had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
    &l2&rAnd he said, The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; &l3&rThe'
  '41': 'God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my
    salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.
    &l4&rI will call on the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved
    from mine enemies.'
  '42': '&l5&rWhen the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made
    me afraid; &l6&rThe sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented
    me; &l7&rIn my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God: and he did
    hear my voice'
  '43': 'out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears. &l8&rThen the earth
    shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was
    wroth. &l9&rThere went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
    devoured: coals were'
  '44': 'kindled by it. &l10&rHe bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness
    was under his feet. &l11&rAnd he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen
    upon the wings of the wind. &l12&rAnd he made darkness pavilions round about him,
    dark waters, and'
  '45': thick clouds of the skies. &l13&rThrough the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled. &l14&rThe Lord thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice. &l15&rAnd he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
  '46': '&l16&rAnd the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world
    were discovered, at the rebuking of the Lord, at the blast of the breath of his
    nostrils. &l17&rHe sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
    &l18&rHe delivered me'
  '47': 'from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong
    for me. &l19&rThey prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Lord was my
    stay. &l20&rHe brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because
    he delighted in me.'
  '48': ' &l21&rThe Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the
    cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. &l22&rFor I have kept the ways of
    the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. &l23&rFor all his judgments
    were before me:'
  '49': and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them. &l24&rI was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity. &l25&rTherefore the Lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.
  '50': '&l26&rWith the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright
    man thou wilt shew thyself upright. &l27&rWith the pure thou wilt shew thyself
    pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.'

  '1': 'Chapter 22 Cont.

    &l28&rAnd the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty,
    that thou mayest bring them down. &l29&rFor thou art my lamp, O Lord: and the
    Lord will lighten my darkness. &l30&rFor by thee I have run through a troop:'
  '2': 'by my God have I leaped over a wall. &l31&rAs for God, his way is perfect;
    the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.
    &l32&rFor who is God, save the Lord? and who is a rock, save our God? &l33&rGod
    is my strength and'

    feet: and setteth me upon my high places. &l35&rHe teacheth my hands to war; so
    that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. &l36&rThou hast also given me the
    shield of thy salvation:'
  '4': and thy gentleness hath made me great. &l37&rThou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip. &l38&rI have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them. &l39&rAnd I have consumed them, and
  '5': 'wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.
    &l40&rFor thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against
    me hast thou subdued under me. &l41&rThou hast also given me the necks of mine
    enemies, that I'
  '6': might destroy them that hate me. &l42&rThey looked, but there was none to save; even unto the Lord, but he answered them not. &l43&rThen did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them
  '7': 'abroad. &l44&rThou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
    thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve
    me. &l45&rStrangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they
    shall be obedient'
  '8': unto me. &l46&rStrangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places. &l47&rThe Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. &l48&rIt is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the
  '9': 'people under me. &l49&rAnd that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou
    also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered
    me from the violent man. &l50&rTherefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord,
    among the'
  '10': 'heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name. &l51&rHe is the tower of
    salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to
    his seed for evermore.'
  '11': 'Chapter 23

    Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man
    who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist
    of Israel, said, &l2&rThe Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in
    my'
  '12': tongue. &l3&rThe God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. &l4&rAnd he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass
  '13': 'springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain. &l5&rAlthough my
    house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered
    in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although
    he make it not'
  '14': 'to grow. &l6&rBut the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
    away, because they cannot be taken with hands: &l7&rBut the man that shall touch
    them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly
    burned with fire'
  '15': 'in the same place. &l8&rThese be the names of the mighty men whom David had:
    The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino
    the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
    &l9&rAnd after'
  '16': 'him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men
    with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together
    to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away: &l10&rHe arose, and smote the
    Philistines until his'
  '17': 'hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the Lord wrought a
    great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil. &l11&rAnd
    after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered
    together into'
  '18': 'a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled
    from the Philistines. &l12&rBut he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended
    it, and slew the Philistines: and the Lord wrought a great victory. &l13&rAnd
    three of the thirty'
  '19': 'chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam:
    and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim. &l14&rAnd David
    was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
    &l15&rAnd'
  '20': David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate! &l16&rAnd the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the
  '21': 'gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink
    thereof, but poured it out unto the Lord. &l17&rAnd he said, Be it far from me,
    O Lord, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy
    of their'
  '22': lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men. &l18&rAnd Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among
  '23': 'three. &l19&rWas he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
    captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three. &l20&rAnd Benaiah the son
    of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he
    slew two lionlike men of'
  '24': 'Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of
    snow: &l21&rAnd he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear
    in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of
    the Egyptian''s hand,'
  '25': and slew him with his own spear. &l22&rThese things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men. &l23&rHe was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.
  '26': '&l24&rAsahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of
    Dodo of Bethlehem, &l25&rShammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, &l26&rHelez
    the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, &l27&rAbiezer the Anethothite,
    Mebunnai the'
  '27': Hushathite, &l28&rZalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, &l29&rHeleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, &l30&rBenaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, &l31&rAbialbon

  '30': 'Ithrite, &l39&rUriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.'
  '31': 'Chapter 24

    And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David
    against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah. &l2&rFor the king said to Joab
    the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of
    Israel,'
  '32': from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people. &l3&rAnd Joab said unto the king, Now the Lord thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may
  '33': 'see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing? &l4&rNotwithstanding
    the king''s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host.
    And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king,
    to number the'
  '34': 'people of Israel. &l5&rAnd they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer,
    on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and
    toward Jazer: &l6&rThen they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi;
    and they came to Danjaan,'
  '35': 'and about to Zidon, &l7&rAnd came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all
    the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south
    of Judah, even to Beersheba. &l8&rSo when they had gone through all the land,
    they came to Jerusalem'
  '36': 'at the end of nine months and twenty days. &l9&rAnd Joab gave up the sum
    of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred
    thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred
    thousand men.'
  '37': '&l10&rAnd David''s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.
    And David said unto the Lord, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now,
    I beseech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done
    very foolishly.'
  '38': '&l11&rFor when David was up in the morning, the word of the Lord came unto
    the prophet Gad, David''s seer, saying, &l12&rGo and say unto David, Thus saith
    the Lord, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it
    unto thee. &l13&rSo Gad'
  '39': came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see
  '40': 'what answer I shall return to him that sent me. &l14&rAnd David said unto
    Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the Lord; for his
    mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man. &l15&rSo the Lord
    sent a pestilence upon'
  '41': 'Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the
    people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men. &l16&rAnd when the angel
    stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord repented him of
    the evil, and said to'
  '42': 'the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And
    the angel of the Lord was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite. &l17&rAnd
    David spake unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said,
    Lo, I have'
  '43': 'sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let
    thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father''s house. &l18&rAnd
    Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the Lord
    in the'
  '44': 'threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite. &l19&rAnd David, according to the
    saying of Gad, went up as the Lord commanded. &l20&rAnd Araunah looked, and saw
    the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed
    himself before the'
  '45': king on his face upon the ground. &l21&rAnd Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the Lord, that the plague may be stayed from the people. &l22&rAnd
  '46': 'Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth
    good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments
    and other instruments of the oxen for wood. &l23&rAll these things did Araunah,
    as a king, give'
  '47': 'unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The Lord thy God accept thee.
    &l24&rAnd the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at
    a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which
    doth cost me'
  '48': nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. &l25&rAnd David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed
  '49': from Israel.
