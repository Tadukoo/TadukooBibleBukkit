  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God
    our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: &l2&rGrace unto you, and peace, from God
    our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. &l3&rWe are bound to thank God always for
    you,'
  '2': brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; &l4&rSo that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions
  '3': 'and tribulations that ye endure: &l5&rWhich is a manifest token of the righteous
    judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which
    ye also suffer: &l6&rSeeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation
    to them'
  '4': that trouble you; &l7&rAnd to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, &l8&rIn flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
  '5': 'Christ: &l9&rWho shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence
    of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; &l10&rWhen he shall come to be glorified
    in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony
    among'
  '6': 'you was believed) in that day. &l11&rWherefore also we pray always for you,
    that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure
    of his goodness, and the work of faith with power: &l12&rThat the name of our
    Lord Jesus'
  '7': Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
  '8': 'Chapter 2

    Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our
    gathering together unto him, &l2&rThat ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,
    neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of'
  '9': 'Christ is at hand. &l3&rLet no man deceive you by any means: for that day
    shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be
    revealed, the son of perdition; &l4&rWho opposeth and exalteth himself above all
    that is called God, or'
  '10': that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. &l5&rRemember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? &l6&rAnd now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.
  '11': '&l7&rFor the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth
    will let, until he be taken out of the way. &l8&rAnd then shall that Wicked be
    revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall
    destroy with the'
  '12': 'brightness of his coming: &l9&rEven him, whose coming is after the working
    of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, &l10&rAnd with all deceivableness
    of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of
    the truth, that'
  '13': 'they might be saved. &l11&rAnd for this cause God shall send them strong
    delusion, that they should believe a lie: &l12&rThat they all might be damned
    who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. &l13&rBut we
    are bound to give thanks'
  '14': 'alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from
    the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and
    belief of the truth: &l14&rWhereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining
    of the glory of our'
  '15': Lord Jesus Christ. &l15&rTherefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle. &l16&rNow our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us
  '16': everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, &l17&rComfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
  '17': 'Chapter 3

    Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course,
    and be glorified, even as it is with you: &l2&rAnd that we may be delivered from
    unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith. &l3&rBut the Lord is'
  '18': faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil. &l4&rAnd we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you. &l5&rAnd the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient
  '19': waiting for Christ. &l6&rNow we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. &l7&rFor yourselves know how ye ought
  '20': 'to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; &l8&rNeither
    did we eat any man''s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night
    and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you: &l9&rNot because we have
    not power, but'
  '21': to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us. &l10&rFor even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. &l11&rFor we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all,
  '22': but are busybodies. &l12&rNow them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. &l13&rBut ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing. &l14&rAnd if any man obey not our word by this
  '23': epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. &l15&rYet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. &l16&rNow the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all. &l17&rThe
  '24': 'salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle:
    so I write. &l18&rThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.'
