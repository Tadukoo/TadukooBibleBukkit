  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise
    of life which is in Christ Jesus, &l2&rTo Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace,
    mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. &l3&rI thank
    God, whom'
  '2': I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day; &l4&rGreatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; &l5&rWhen I call to remembrance the
  '3': unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. &l6&rWherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my
  '4': 'hands. &l7&rFor God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and
    of love, and of a sound mind. &l8&rBe not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony
    of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of
    the gospel'
  '5': according to the power of God; &l9&rWho hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, &l10&rBut is now made manifest by
  '6': 'the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath
    brought life and immortality to light through the gospel: &l11&rWhereunto I am
    appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. &l12&rFor
    the which cause I'
  '7': 'also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I
    have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
    unto him against that day. &l13&rHold fast the form of sound words, which thou
    hast heard of me,'
  '8': in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. &l14&rThat good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. &l15&rThis thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and
  '9': 'Hermogenes. &l16&rThe Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he
    oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: &l17&rBut, when he was in Rome,
    he sought me out very diligently, and found me. &l18&rThe Lord grant unto him
    that he may find'
  '10': 'mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto
    me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.'
  '11': 'Chapter 2

    Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. &l2&rAnd
    the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou
    to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. &l3&rThou therefore endure'
  '12': hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. &l4&rNo man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. &l5&rAnd if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except
  '13': he strive lawfully. &l6&rThe husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. &l7&rConsider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. &l8&rRemember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead
  '14': 'according to my gospel: &l9&rWherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even
    unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. &l10&rTherefore I endure all things
    for the elect''s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ
    Jesus with'
  '15': 'eternal glory. &l11&rIt is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him,
    we shall also live with him: &l12&rIf we suffer, we shall also reign with him:
    if we deny him, he also will deny us: &l13&rIf we believe not, yet he abideth
    faithful: he cannot deny'
  '16': himself. &l14&rOf these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. &l15&rStudy to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be
  '17': 'ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. &l16&rBut shun profane and vain
    babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. &l17&rAnd their word
    will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; &l18&rWho concerning
    the truth have'
  '18': erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. &l19&rNevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart
  '19': from iniquity. &l20&rBut in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. &l21&rIf a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour,
  '20': 'sanctified, and meet for the master''s use, and prepared unto every good
    work. &l22&rFlee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity,
    peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. &l23&rBut foolish
    and unlearned questions'
  '21': avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. &l24&rAnd the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, &l25&rIn meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to
  '22': the acknowledging of the truth; &l26&rAnd that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
  '23': 'Chapter 3

    This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. &l2&rFor men
    shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient
    to parents, unthankful, unholy, &l3&rWithout natural affection, trucebreakers,'
  '24': 'false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, &l4&rTraitors,
    heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; &l5&rHaving a
    form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. &l6&rFor
    of this sort'
  '25': are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, &l7&rEver learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. &l8&rNow as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist
  '26': 'the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. &l9&rBut
    they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men,
    as their''s also was. &l10&rBut thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life,
    purpose, faith,'
  '27': 'longsuffering, charity, patience, &l11&rPersecutions, afflictions, which
    came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but
    out of them all the Lord delivered me. &l12&rYea, and all that will live godly
    in Christ Jesus shall'
  '28': suffer persecution. &l13&rBut evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. &l14&rBut continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; &l15&rAnd that
  '29': from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. &l16&rAll scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
  '30': 'instruction in righteousness: &l17&rThat the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly
    furnished unto all good works.'
  '31': 'Chapter 4

    I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge
    the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; &l2&rPreach the word;
    be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering
    and'
  '32': doctrine. &l3&rFor the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; &l4&rAnd they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
  '33': ' &l5&rBut watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an
    evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. &l6&rFor I am now ready to be offered,
    and the time of my departure is at hand. &l7&rI have fought a good fight, I have
    finished my'
  '34': 'course, I have kept the faith: &l8&rHenceforth there is laid up for me a
    crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at
    that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
    &l9&rDo thy diligence to'
  '35': 'come shortly unto me: &l10&rFor Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this
    present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto
    Dalmatia. &l11&rOnly Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for
    he is profitable to me'
  '36': 'for the ministry. &l12&rAnd Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. &l13&rThe cloke
    that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books,
    but especially the parchments. &l14&rAlexander the coppersmith did me much evil:
    the Lord'
  '37': 'reward him according to his works: &l15&rOf whom be thou ware also; for he
    hath greatly withstood our words. &l16&rAt my first answer no man stood with me,
    but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. &l17&rNotwithstanding'
  '38': 'the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might
    be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out
    of the mouth of the lion. &l18&rAnd the Lord shall deliver me from every evil
    work, and will preserve'
  '39': 'me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. &l19&rSalute
    Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. &l20&rErastus abode at Corinth:
    but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick. &l21&rDo thy diligence to come before'
  '40': winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. &l22&rThe Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
