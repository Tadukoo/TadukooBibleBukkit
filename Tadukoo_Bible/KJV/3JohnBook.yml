    The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth. &l2&rBeloved,
    I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy
    soul prospereth. &l3&rFor I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified
    of the'
  '2': truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. &l4&rI have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. &l5&rBeloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; &l6&rWhich have borne witness of

    true. &l13&rI had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write
    unto thee: &l14&rBut I'
  '7': trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
