  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to
    do and teach, &l2&rUntil the day in which he was taken up, after that he through
    the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen: &l3&rTo'
  '2': 'whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs,
    being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom
    of God: &l4&rAnd, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they
    should not'
  '3': depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. &l5&rFor John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. &l6&rWhen they therefore were come together,
  '4': they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? &l7&rAnd he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. &l8&rBut ye shall receive power, after
  '5': 'that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
    in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of
    the earth. &l9&rAnd when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
    taken up; and a'
  '6': cloud received him out of their sight. &l10&rAnd while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; &l11&rWhich also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which
  '7': is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. &l12&rThen returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey. &l13&rAnd when they were come in, they
  '8': went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. &l14&rThese all continued with one accord in
  '9': prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren. &l15&rAnd in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,) &l16&rMen and
  '10': brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus. &l17&rFor he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry. &l18&rNow
  '11': this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. &l19&rAnd it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue,
  '12': 'Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. &l20&rFor it is written in
    the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein:
    and his bishoprick let another take. &l21&rWherefore of these men which have companied
    with us all'
  '13': the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, &l22&rBeginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection. &l23&rAnd they appointed two, Joseph called
  '14': Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. &l24&rAnd they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, &l25&rThat he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by
  '15': transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. &l26&rAnd they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
  '16': 'Chapter 2

    And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in
    one place. &l2&rAnd suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
    wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. &l3&rAnd there appeared'
  '17': unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. &l4&rAnd they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. &l5&rAnd there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men,
  '18': out of every nation under heaven. &l6&rNow when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. &l7&rAnd they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
  '19': Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? &l8&rAnd how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? &l9&rParthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
  '20': '&l10&rPhrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene,
    and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, &l11&rCretes and Arabians, we do hear
    them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. &l12&rAnd they were all
    amazed, and were'
  '21': in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this? &l13&rOthers mocking said, These men are full of new wine. &l14&rBut Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be
  '22': 'this known unto you, and hearken to my words: &l15&rFor these are not drunken,
    as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. &l16&rBut this is that
    which was spoken by the prophet Joel; &l17&rAnd it shall come to pass in the last
    days, saith'
  '23': 'God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your
    daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men
    shall dream dreams: &l18&rAnd on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour
    out in those days of my'
  '24': 'Spirit; and they shall prophesy: &l19&rAnd I will shew wonders in heaven
    above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: &l20&rThe
    sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and
    notable day of'
  '25': 'the Lord come: &l21&rAnd it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call
    on the name of the Lord shall be saved. &l22&rYe men of Israel, hear these words;
    Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and
    signs, which God did'
  '26': 'by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: &l23&rHim, being
    delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken,
    and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: &l24&rWhom God hath raised up, having
    loosed the pains of'
  '27': 'death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. &l25&rFor
    David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he
    is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: &l26&rTherefore did my heart
    rejoice, and my'
  '28': 'tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: &l27&rBecause
    thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to
    see corruption. &l28&rThou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt
    make me full of joy with'
  '29': thy countenance. &l29&rMen and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. &l30&rTherefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him,
  '30': that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; &l31&rHe seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. &l32&rThis
  '31': Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. &l33&rTherefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. &l34&rFor David is not
  '32': 'ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord,
    Sit thou on my right hand, &l35&rUntil I make thy foes thy footstool. &l36&rTherefore
    let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus,
    whom ye have'
  '33': crucified, both Lord and Christ. &l37&rNow when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? &l38&rThen Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one
  '34': of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &l39&rFor the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. &l40&rAnd
  '35': 'with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves
    from this untoward generation. &l41&rThen they that gladly received his word were
    baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.
    &l42&rAnd they'
  '36': 'continued stedfastly in the apostles'' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking
    of bread, and in prayers. &l43&rAnd fear came upon every soul: and many wonders
    and signs were done by the apostles. &l44&rAnd all that believed were together,
    and had all'
  '37': things common; &l45&rAnd sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. &l46&rAnd they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and
  '38': singleness of heart, &l47&rPraising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.
  '39': 'Chapter 3

    Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being
    the ninth hour. &l2&rAnd a certain man lame from his mother''s womb was carried,
    whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask
    alms'
  '40': of them that entered into the temple; &l3&rWho seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. &l4&rAnd Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. &l5&rAnd he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of
  '41': 'them. &l6&rThen Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have
    give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. &l7&rAnd
    he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and
    ankle bones received'
  '42': 'strength. &l8&rAnd he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them
    into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. &l9&rAnd all the people
    saw him walking and praising God: &l10&rAnd they knew that it was he which sat
    for alms at the'
  '43': 'Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement
    at that which had happened unto him. &l11&rAnd as the lame man which was healed
    held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is
    called Solomon''s,'
  '44': greatly wondering. &l12&rAnd when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? &l13&rThe God of Abraham, and of
  '45': Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go. &l14&rBut ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be
  '46': 'granted unto you; &l15&rAnd killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised
    from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. &l16&rAnd his name through faith in his
    name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is
    by him hath given him'
  '47': this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. &l17&rAnd now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. &l18&rBut those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he
  '48': 'hath so fulfilled. &l19&rRepent ye therefore, and be converted, that your
    sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence
    of the Lord. &l20&rAnd he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto
    you: &l21&rWhom'
  '49': the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. &l22&rFor Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of
  '50': your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. &l23&rAnd it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.

    &l24&rYea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many
    as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. &l25&rYe are the children
    of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying'
  '2': unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. &l26&rUnto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.
  '3': 'Chapter 4

    And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple,
    and the Sadducees, came upon them, &l2&rBeing grieved that they taught the people,
    and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. &l3&rAnd they laid
    hands'
  '4': 'on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.
    &l4&rHowbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the
    men was about five thousand. &l5&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that their
    rulers, and elders, and'
  '5': scribes, &l6&rAnd Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. &l7&rAnd when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what
  '6': name, have ye done this? &l8&rThen Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, &l9&rIf we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; &l10&rBe it
  '7': known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. &l11&rThis is the stone which was set at nought of
  '8': 'you builders, which is become the head of the corner. &l12&rNeither is there
    salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among
    men, whereby we must be saved. &l13&rNow when they saw the boldness of Peter and
    John, and perceived'
  '9': that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. &l14&rAnd beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. &l15&rBut when they had commanded
  '10': them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, &l16&rSaying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. &l17&rBut
  '11': that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. &l18&rAnd they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. &l19&rBut Peter and John
  '12': answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. &l20&rFor we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. &l21&rSo when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
  '13': 'finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all
    men glorified God for that which was done. &l22&rFor the man was above forty years
    old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed. &l23&rAnd being let go, they
    went to their own'
  '14': company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. &l24&rAnd when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in
  '15': 'them is: &l25&rWho by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the
    heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? &l26&rThe kings of the earth
    stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against
    his Christ. &l27&rFor'
  '16': of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, &l28&rFor to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
  '17': '&l29&rAnd now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants,
    that with all boldness they may speak thy word, &l30&rBy stretching forth thine
    hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child
    Jesus. &l31&rAnd'
  '18': 'when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together;
    and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with
    boldness. &l32&rAnd the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and
    of one soul:'
  '19': 'neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was
    his own; but they had all things common. &l33&rAnd with great power gave the apostles
    witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
    &l34&rNeither'
  '20': 'was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands
    or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, &l35&rAnd
    laid them down at the apostles'' feet: and distribution was made unto every man
    according as he'
  '21': had need. &l36&rAnd Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, &l37&rHaving land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
  '22': 'Chapter 5

    But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, &l2&rAnd
    kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain
    part, and laid it at the apostles'' feet. &l3&rBut Peter said, Ananias, why'
  '23': hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? &l4&rWhiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?
  '24': 'thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. &l5&rAnd Ananias hearing these
    words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard
    these things. &l6&rAnd the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out,
    and buried him.'
  '25': '&l7&rAnd it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not
    knowing what was done, came in. &l8&rAnd Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether
    ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. &l9&rThen Peter
    said unto her, How is'
  '26': 'it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold,
    the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry
    thee out. &l10&rThen fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the
    ghost: and the young men'
  '27': came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. &l11&rAnd great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things. &l12&rAnd by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the
  '28': 'people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon''s porch. &l13&rAnd
    of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.
    &l14&rAnd believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and
    women.) &l15&rInsomuch'
  '29': that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. &l16&rThere came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing
  '30': 'sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were
    healed every one. &l17&rThen the high priest rose up, and all they that were with
    him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation, &l18&rAnd
    laid their'
  '31': hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison. &l19&rBut the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, &l20&rGo, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. &l21&rAnd when
  '32': they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them
  '33': 'brought. &l22&rBut when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,
    they returned and told, &l23&rSaying, The prison truly found we shut with all
    safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened,
    we found no man'
  '34': within. &l24&rNow when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow. &l25&rThen came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in
  '35': 'the temple, and teaching the people. &l26&rThen went the captain with the
    officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest
    they should have been stoned. &l27&rAnd when they had brought them, they set them
    before the council:'
  '36': and the high priest asked them, &l28&rSaying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. &l29&rThen Peter and the other
  '37': apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. &l30&rThe God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. &l31&rHim hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to
  '38': Israel, and forgiveness of sins. &l32&rAnd we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. &l33&rWhen they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them. &l34&rThen
  '39': stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; &l35&rAnd said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye
  '40': 'intend to do as touching these men. &l36&rFor before these days rose up Theudas,
    boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred,
    joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered,
    and brought to'
  '41': 'nought. &l37&rAfter this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
    taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as
    many as obeyed him, were dispersed. &l38&rAnd now I say unto you, Refrain from
    these men, and let them'
  '42': 'alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:
    &l39&rBut if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even
    to fight against God. &l40&rAnd to him they agreed: and when they had called the
    apostles, and beaten'
  '43': them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. &l41&rAnd they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. &l42&rAnd daily in the temple, and in
  '44': every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.
  '45': 'Chapter 6

    And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose
    a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected
    in the daily ministration. &l2&rThen the twelve called the multitude of the'
  '46': disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. &l3&rWherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
  '47': '&l4&rBut we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry
    of the word. &l5&rAnd the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen,
    a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor,
    and Timon,'
  '48': 'and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: &l6&rWhom they set before
    the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. &l7&rAnd
    the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
    greatly; and a'
  '49': great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. &l8&rAnd Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. &l9&rThen there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and
  '50': Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. &l10&rAnd they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.

  '4': 'Chapter 7

    Then said the high priest, Are these things so? &l2&rAnd he said, Men, brethren,
    and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when
    he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, &l3&rAnd said unto him, Get
    thee out'
  '5': 'of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall
    shew thee. &l4&rThen came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran:
    and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein
    ye now dwell.'
  '6': ' &l5&rAnd he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his
    foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to
    his seed after him, when as yet he had no child. &l6&rAnd God spake on this wise,
    That his seed'
  '7': 'should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage,
    and entreat them evil four hundred years. &l7&rAnd the nation to whom they shall
    be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and
    serve me in'
  '8': 'this place. &l8&rAnd he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham
    begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob
    begat the twelve patriarchs. &l9&rAnd the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph
    into Egypt:'
  '9': but God was with him, &l10&rAnd delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. &l11&rNow there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt
  '10': 'and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. &l12&rBut
    when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.
    &l13&rAnd at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph''s
    kindred was'
  '11': made known unto Pharaoh. &l14&rThen sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. &l15&rSo Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, &l16&rAnd were carried over into Sychem, and laid in
  '12': the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem. &l17&rBut when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, &l18&rTill another king arose, which
  '13': knew not Joseph. &l19&rThe same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live. &l20&rIn which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his
  '14': 'father''s house three months: &l21&rAnd when he was cast out, Pharaoh''s
    daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. &l22&rAnd Moses was learned
    in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. &l23&rAnd
    when he was full'
  '15': 'forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children
    of Israel. &l24&rAnd seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged
    him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian: &l25&rFor he supposed his brethren
    would have'
  '16': 'understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood
    not. &l26&rAnd the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would
    have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one
    to another?'
  '17': '&l27&rBut he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made
    thee a ruler and a judge over us? &l28&rWilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the
    Egyptian yesterday? &l29&rThen fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in
    the land of Madian,'
  '18': 'where he begat two sons. &l30&rAnd when forty years were expired, there appeared
    to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire
    in a bush. &l31&rWhen Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near
    to behold it,'
  '19': 'the voice of the Lord came unto him, &l32&rSaying, I am the God of thy fathers,
    the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled,
    and durst not behold. &l33&rThen said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from
    thy feet: for'
  '20': the place where thou standest is holy ground. &l34&rI have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt. &l35&rThis Moses whom
  '21': they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. &l36&rHe brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of
  '22': Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. &l37&rThis is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear. &l38&rThis is he, that
  '23': 'was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in
    the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give
    unto us: &l39&rTo whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and
    in their hearts turned'
  '24': 'back again into Egypt, &l40&rSaying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before
    us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not
    what is become of him. &l41&rAnd they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice
    unto the idol,'
  '25': and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. &l42&rThen God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty
  '26': 'years in the wilderness? &l43&rYea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch,
    and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I
    will carry you away beyond Babylon. &l44&rOur fathers had the tabernacle of witness
    in the wilderness,'
  '27': as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen. &l45&rWhich also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our
  '28': fathers, unto the days of David; &l46&rWho found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. &l47&rBut Solomon built him an house. &l48&rHowbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,
  '29': '&l49&rHeaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye
    build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? &l50&rHath not my hand
    made all these things? &l51&rYe stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears,
    ye do always resist'
  '30': 'the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. &l52&rWhich of the prophets
    have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before
    of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:
    &l53&rWho have'
  '31': received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it. &l54&rWhen they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. &l55&rBut he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and
  '32': saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, &l56&rAnd said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. &l57&rThen they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him
  '33': 'with one accord, &l58&rAnd cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and
    the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man''s feet, whose name was Saul.
    &l59&rAnd they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive
    my spirit. &l60&rAnd'
  '34': he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
  '35': 'Chapter 8

    And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution
    against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad
    throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. &l2&rAnd'
  '36': devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. &l3&rAs for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. &l4&rTherefore they that were scattered abroad went
  '37': every where preaching the word. &l5&rThen Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. &l6&rAnd the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. &l7&rFor
  '38': 'unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed
    with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. &l8&rAnd
    there was great joy in that city. &l9&rBut there was a certain man, called Simon,
    which'
  '39': 'beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria,
    giving out that himself was some great one: &l10&rTo whom they all gave heed,
    from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. &l11&rAnd
    to him they'
  '40': had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. &l12&rBut when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. &l13&rThen Simon
  '41': 'himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip,
    and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. &l14&rNow when
    the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word
    of God, they sent unto'
  '42': 'them Peter and John: &l15&rWho, when they were come down, prayed for them,
    that they might receive the Holy Ghost: &l16&r(For as yet he was fallen upon none
    of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) &l17&rThen laid
    they their hands'
  '43': on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. &l18&rAnd when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, &l19&rSaying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the
  '44': 'Holy Ghost. &l20&rBut Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because
    thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. &l21&rThou
    hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight
    of God.'
  '45': '&l22&rRepent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the
    thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. &l23&rFor I perceive that thou art
    in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. &l24&rThen answered Simon,
    and said, Pray ye'
  '46': to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. &l25&rAnd they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. &l26&rAnd the
  '47': 'angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south
    unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. &l27&rAnd
    he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority
    under Candace'
  '48': queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, &l28&rWas returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. &l29&rThen the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this
  '49': chariot. &l30&rAnd Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? &l31&rAnd he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with
  '50': 'him. &l32&rThe place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led
    as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened
    he not his mouth:'

    &l33&rIn his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his
    generation? for his life is taken from the earth. &l34&rAnd the eunuch answered
    Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself,
    or'
  '2': 'of some other man? &l35&rThen Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same
    scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. &l36&rAnd as they went on their way, they
    came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth
    hinder me to be'
  '3': 'baptized? &l37&rAnd Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou
    mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
    &l38&rAnd he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into
    the water, both'
  '4': 'Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. &l39&rAnd when they were come
    up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch

    at Azotus: and passing'

  '6': 'Chapter 9

    And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of
    the Lord, went unto the high priest, &l2&rAnd desired of him letters to Damascus
    to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or
    women,'
  '7': 'he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. &l3&rAnd as he journeyed, he came
    near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:
    &l4&rAnd he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul,
    why persecutest thou me?'
  '8': ' &l5&rAnd he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom
    thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. &l6&rAnd he
    trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord
    said unto him, Arise,'
  '9': 'and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. &l7&rAnd
    the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing
    no man. &l8&rAnd Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he
    saw no man: but they'
  '10': led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. &l9&rAnd he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink. &l10&rAnd there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said,
  '11': 'Behold, I am here, Lord. &l11&rAnd the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go
    into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for
    one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, &l12&rAnd hath seen in a
    vision a man named'
  '12': 'Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his
    sight. &l13&rThen Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how
    much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: &l14&rAnd here he hath authority
    from the chief'
  '13': 'priests to bind all that call on thy name. &l15&rBut the Lord said unto him,
    Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles,
    and kings, and the children of Israel: &l16&rFor I will shew him how great things
    he must'
  '14': suffer for my name's sake. &l17&rAnd Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy
  '15': 'sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. &l18&rAnd immediately there fell
    from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose,
    and was baptized. &l19&rAnd when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then
    was Saul certain'
  '16': days with the disciples which were at Damascus. &l20&rAnd straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. &l21&rBut all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in
  '17': Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests? &l22&rBut Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ. &l23&rAnd after that many
  '18': 'days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him: &l24&rBut their laying
    await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
    &l25&rThen the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a
    basket. &l26&rAnd'
  '19': 'when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples:
    but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple. &l27&rBut
    Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how
    he had seen the'
  '20': Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. &l28&rAnd he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem. &l29&rAnd he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against
  '21': 'the Grecians: but they went about to slay him. &l30&rWhich when the brethren
    knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. &l31&rThen
    had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were
    edified; and'
  '22': walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied. &l32&rAnd it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda. &l33&rAnd there he found a certain man named
  '23': 'Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. &l34&rAnd
    Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy
    bed. And he arose immediately. &l35&rAnd all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw
    him, and turned'
  '24': 'to the Lord. &l36&rNow there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha,
    which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and
    almsdeeds which she did. &l37&rAnd it came to pass in those days, that she was
    sick, and died: whom'
  '25': when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. &l38&rAnd forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them. &l39&rThen Peter
  '26': 'arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper
    chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments
    which Dorcas made, while she was with them. &l40&rBut Peter put them all forth,
    and kneeled'
  '27': 'down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she
    opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up. &l41&rAnd he gave her his
    hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented
    her alive. &l42&rAnd'
  '28': it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. &l43&rAnd it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
  '29': 'Chapter 10

    There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band
    called the Italian band, &l2&rA devout man, and one that feared God with all his
    house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. &l3&rHe saw
    in a'
  '30': vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. &l4&rAnd when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a
  '31': 'memorial before God. &l5&rAnd now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon,
    whose surname is Peter: &l6&rHe lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is
    by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. &l7&rAnd when the
    angel which spake'
  '32': unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; &l8&rAnd when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa. &l9&rOn the morrow, as they went on their
  '33': 'journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to
    pray about the sixth hour: &l10&rAnd he became very hungry, and would have eaten:
    but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, &l11&rAnd saw heaven opened,
    and a certain vessel'
  '34': 'descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners,
    and let down to the earth: &l12&rWherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts
    of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. &l13&rAnd
    there came a voice'
  '35': to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. &l14&rBut Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. &l15&rAnd the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. &l16&rThis was
  '36': 'done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven. &l17&rNow
    while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean,
    behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon''s house,
    and stood before the'
  '37': gate, &l18&rAnd called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. &l19&rWhile Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. &l20&rArise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them,
  '38': 'doubting nothing: for I have sent them. &l21&rThen Peter went down to the
    men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye
    seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? &l22&rAnd they said, Cornelius
    the centurion, a just'
  '39': man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. &l23&rThen called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went
  '40': away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him. &l24&rAnd the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends. &l25&rAnd as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met
  '41': him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. &l26&rBut Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. &l27&rAnd as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. &l28&rAnd he said unto them, Ye know how that it
  '42': 'is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto
    one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common
    or unclean. &l29&rTherefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was
    sent for: I ask'
  '43': therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? &l30&rAnd Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, &l31&rAnd said, Cornelius, thy prayer
  '44': 'is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. &l32&rSend
    therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged
    in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall
    speak unto thee.'
  '45': '&l33&rImmediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that
    thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things
    that are commanded thee of God. &l34&rThen Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of
    a truth I perceive'
  '46': 'that God is no respecter of persons: &l35&rBut in every nation he that feareth
    him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. &l36&rThe word which God
    sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord
    of all:) &l37&rThat'
  '47': 'word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began
    from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; &l38&rHow God anointed Jesus
    of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and
    healing all that'
  '48': 'were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. &l39&rAnd we are witnesses
    of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom
    they slew and hanged on a tree: &l40&rHim God raised up the third day, and shewed
    him openly;'
  '49': '&l41&rNot to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to
    us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. &l42&rAnd he commanded
    us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained
    of God to be the'
  '50': Judge of quick and dead. &l43&rTo him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. &l44&rWhile Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.

    &l45&rAnd they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as
    came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of
    the Holy Ghost. &l46&rFor they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.
    Then'
  '2': answered Peter, &l47&rCan any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? &l48&rAnd he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
  '3': 'Chapter 11

    And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had
    also received the word of God. &l2&rAnd when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they
    that were of the circumcision contended with him, &l3&rSaying, Thou wentest in
    to men'
  '4': 'uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. &l4&rBut Peter rehearsed the matter
    from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying, &l5&rI was in
    the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend,
    as it had been a'
  '5': 'great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:
    &l6&rUpon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted
    beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
    &l7&rAnd I heard'
  '6': 'a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat. &l8&rBut I said, Not so,
    Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth. &l9&rBut
    the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not
    thou common.'
  '7': '&l10&rAnd this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
    &l11&rAnd, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house
    where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me. &l12&rAnd the Spirit bade me go with
    them, nothing'
  '8': 'doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into
    the man''s house: &l13&rAnd he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house,
    which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname
    is Peter; &l14&rWho'
  '9': shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved. &l15&rAnd as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. &l16&rThen remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water;
  '10': but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. &l17&rForasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God? &l18&rWhen they heard these things, they held their peace,
  '11': and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. &l19&rNow they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to
  '12': 'none but unto the Jews only. &l20&rAnd some of them were men of Cyprus and
    Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching
    the Lord Jesus. &l21&rAnd the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
    believed, and'
  '13': 'turned unto the Lord. &l22&rThen tidings of these things came unto the ears
    of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should
    go as far as Antioch. &l23&rWho, when he came, and had seen the grace of God,
    was glad, and'
  '14': 'exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the
    Lord. &l24&rFor he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and
    much people was added unto the Lord. &l25&rThen departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for
    to seek Saul:'
  '15': '&l26&rAnd when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came
    to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught
    much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. &l27&rAnd
    in these days came'
  '16': 'prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. &l28&rAnd there stood up one of them
    named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout
    all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. &l29&rThen the
    disciples,'
  '17': 'every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren
    which dwelt in Judaea: &l30&rWhich also they did, and sent it to the elders by
    the hands of Barnabas and Saul.'
  '18': 'Chapter 12

    Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of
    the church. &l2&rAnd he killed James the brother of John with the sword. &l3&rAnd
    because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then'
  '19': 'were the days of unleavened bread.) &l4&rAnd when he had apprehended him,
    he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep
    him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. &l5&rPeter therefore
    was kept in prison:'
  '20': 'but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. &l6&rAnd
    when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between
    two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the
    prison. &l7&rAnd,'
  '21': 'behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison:
    and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And
    his chains fell off from his hands. &l8&rAnd the angel said unto him, Gird thyself,
    and bind on'
  '22': thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. &l9&rAnd he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. &l10&rWhen they were past the
  '23': 'first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto
    the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed
    on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. &l11&rAnd when
    Peter was come to'
  '24': himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. &l12&rAnd when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary
  '25': the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying. &l13&rAnd as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. &l14&rAnd when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness,
  '26': 'but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. &l15&rAnd they said
    unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then
    said they, It is his angel. &l16&rBut Peter continued knocking: and when they
    had opened the door, and'
  '27': saw him, they were astonished. &l17&rBut he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and
  '28': went into another place. &l18&rNow as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. &l19&rAnd when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to
  '29': 'death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode. &l20&rAnd
    Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one
    accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king''s chamberlain their friend,
    desired peace; because'
  '30': their country was nourished by the king's country. &l21&rAnd upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. &l22&rAnd the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.
  '31': '&l23&rAnd immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not
    God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost. &l24&rBut the
    word of God grew and multiplied. &l25&rAnd Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem,
    when they had'
  '32': fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
  '33': 'Chapter 13

    Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers;
    as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen,
    which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. &l2&rAs they ministered'
  '34': to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. &l3&rAnd when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. &l4&rSo they, being sent forth by the Holy
  '35': 'Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. &l5&rAnd
    when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of
    the Jews: and they had also John to their minister. &l6&rAnd when they had gone
    through the isle'
  '36': 'unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose
    name was Barjesus: &l7&rWhich was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus,
    a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word
    of God. &l8&rBut'
  '37': Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. &l9&rThen Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him. &l10&rAnd said, O full of all subtilty
  '38': and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? &l11&rAnd now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And
  '39': immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. &l12&rThen the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord. &l13&rNow when Paul and his company
  '40': 'loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from
    them returned to Jerusalem. &l14&rBut when they departed from Perga, they came
    to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat
    down. &l15&rAnd after'
  '41': the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. &l16&rThen Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye
  '42': that fear God, give audience. &l17&rThe God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it. &l18&rAnd about the time of forty years
  '43': suffered he their manners in the wilderness. &l19&rAnd when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot. &l20&rAnd after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until
  '44': 'Samuel the prophet. &l21&rAnd afterward they desired a king: and God gave
    unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of
    forty years. &l22&rAnd when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to
    be their king; to whom'
  '45': 'also he gave their testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse,
    a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. &l23&rOf this man''s
    seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus: &l24&rWhen
    John had'
  '46': first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. &l25&rAnd as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy
  '47': to loose. &l26&rMen and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. &l27&rFor they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of
  '48': the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. &l28&rAnd though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. &l29&rAnd when they had fulfilled all that was written of him,
  '49': 'they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. &l30&rBut
    God raised him from the dead: &l31&rAnd he was seen many days of them which came
    up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.

    &l33&rGod hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised

    day have I begotten thee. &l34&rAnd as concerning that he raised him up from'
  '2': the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. &l35&rWherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. &l36&rFor David, after he had served his
  '3': 'own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers,
    and saw corruption: &l37&rBut he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption. &l38&rBe

    words might be preached'
  '6': 'to them the next sabbath. &l43&rNow when the congregation was broken up, many
    of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking
    to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. &l44&rAnd the next sabbath
    day came almost'
  '7': the whole city together to hear the word of God. &l45&rBut when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming. &l46&rThen Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and
  '8': 'said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken
    to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting
    life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. &l47&rFor so hath the Lord commanded us, saying,
    I have set'

    the ends of the earth. &l48&rAnd when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad,
    and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life
    believed.'
  '10': '&l49&rAnd the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. &l50&rBut
    the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the
    city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out
    of their coasts.'
  '11': '&l51&rBut they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto

    And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue
    of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of
    the Greeks believed. &l2&rBut the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and
    made'
  '13': their minds evil affected against the brethren. &l3&rLong time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. &l4&rBut the multitude of the city
  '14': 'was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. &l5&rAnd
    when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with
    their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, &l6&rThey were ware
    of it, and fled'
  '15': 'unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth
    round about: &l7&rAnd there they preached the gospel. &l8&rAnd there sat a certain
    man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother''s womb,
    who never had walked:'
  '16': '&l9&rThe same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving
    that he had faith to be healed, &l10&rSaid with a loud voice, Stand upright on
    thy feet. And he leaped and walked. &l11&rAnd when the people saw what Paul had
    done, they lifted up'
  '17': their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. &l12&rAnd they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. &l13&rThen the priest of Jupiter, which was before their
  '18': city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. &l14&rWhich when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, &l15&rAnd saying, Sirs, why do ye
  '19': 'these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto
    you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven,
    and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: &l16&rWho in times past
    suffered all'
  '20': nations to walk in their own ways. &l17&rNevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. &l18&rAnd with these sayings scarce restrained
  '21': they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them. &l19&rAnd there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead. &l20&rHowbeit, as the
  '22': 'disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and
    the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. &l21&rAnd when they had preached
    the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and
    to Iconium, and'
  '23': Antioch, &l22&rConfirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. &l23&rAnd when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with
  '24': 'fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed. &l24&rAnd
    after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. &l25&rAnd when
    they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia: &l26&rAnd thence
    sailed to'
  '25': Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. &l27&rAnd when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of
  '26': faith unto the Gentiles. &l28&rAnd there they abode long time with the disciples.
  '27': 'Chapter 15

    And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except
    ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. &l2&rWhen therefore
    Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they'
  '28': determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. &l3&rAnd being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion
  '29': 'of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. &l4&rAnd
    when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the
    apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.
    &l5&rBut there rose up'
  '30': certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses. &l6&rAnd the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. &l7&rAnd when there had been
  '31': much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. &l8&rAnd God, which knoweth the hearts, bare
  '32': them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; &l9&rAnd put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. &l10&rNow therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers
  '33': nor we were able to bear? &l11&rBut we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. &l12&rThen all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had
  '34': 'wrought among the Gentiles by them. &l13&rAnd after they had held their peace,
    James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: &l14&rSimeon hath declared
    how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for
    his name.'
  '35': '&l15&rAnd to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, &l16&rAfter
    this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen
    down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: &l17&rThat
    the residue'
  '36': of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. &l18&rKnown unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. &l19&rWherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not
  '37': 'them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: &l20&rBut that we
    write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication,
    and from things strangled, and from blood. &l21&rFor Moses of old time hath in
    every city them that'
  '38': preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day. &l22&rThen pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men
  '39': 'among the brethren: &l23&rAnd they wrote letters by them after this manner;
    The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are
    of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia. &l24&rForasmuch as we have heard,
    that certain'
  '40': 'which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls,
    saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:
    &l25&rIt seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen
    men unto you'
  '41': with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, &l26&rMen that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &l27&rWe have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. &l28&rFor it seemed good to the Holy Ghost,
  '42': 'and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;
    &l29&rThat ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things
    strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do
    well. Fare ye well.'
  '43': '&l30&rSo when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had
    gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: &l31&rWhich when
    they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. &l32&rAnd Judas and Silas, being
    prophets also'
  '44': themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. &l33&rAnd after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. &l34&rNotwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. &l35&rPaul
  '45': also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. &l36&rAnd some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord,
  '46': and see how they do. &l37&rAnd Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. &l38&rBut Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. &l39&rAnd the contention
  '47': 'was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other:
    and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; &l40&rAnd Paul chose Silas,
    and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. &l41&rAnd
    he went through Syria'
  '48': and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
  '49': 'Chapter 16

    Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named

    at'
  '50': 'Lystra and Iconium. &l3&rHim would Paul have to go forth with him; and took

    Come over into Macedonia, and help us. &l10&rAnd after he had seen the vision,
    immediately we'
  '4': endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them. &l11&rTherefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; &l12&rAnd from thence to
  '5': 'Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony:
    and we were in that city abiding certain days. &l13&rAnd on the sabbath we went
    out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat
    down, and spake unto'
  '6': 'the women which resorted thither. &l14&rAnd a certain woman named Lydia, a
    seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose
    heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of
    Paul. &l15&rAnd when'
  '7': she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. &l16&rAnd it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a
  '8': 'spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:
    &l17&rThe same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants
    of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. &l18&rAnd this
    did she many'
  '9': days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. &l19&rAnd when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas,
  '10': and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers, &l20&rAnd brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, &l21&rAnd teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being
  '11': 'Romans. &l22&rAnd the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates
    rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them. &l23&rAnd when they had laid
    many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep
    them safely:'
  '12': ' &l24&rWho, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison,
    and made their feet fast in the stocks. &l25&rAnd at midnight Paul and Silas prayed,
    and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. &l26&rAnd suddenly there
    was a great'
  '13': 'earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately
    all the doors were opened, and every one''s bands were loosed. &l27&rAnd the keeper
    of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew
    out his'
  '14': 'sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been
    fled. &l28&rBut Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for
    we are all here. &l29&rThen he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
    and fell down'
  '15': before Paul and Silas, &l30&rAnd brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? &l31&rAnd they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. &l32&rAnd they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all
  '16': that were in his house. &l33&rAnd he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. &l34&rAnd when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God
  '17': 'with all his house. &l35&rAnd when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants,
    saying, Let those men go. &l36&rAnd the keeper of the prison told this saying
    to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go
    in peace.'
  '18': '&l37&rBut Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being
    Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay
    verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out. &l38&rAnd the serjeants
    told these words'
  '19': 'unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.
    &l39&rAnd they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them
    to depart out of the city. &l40&rAnd they went out of the prison, and entered
    into the house of'
  '20': 'Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.'
  '21': 'Chapter 17

    Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica,
    where was a synagogue of the Jews: &l2&rAnd Paul, as his manner was, went in unto
    them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,'
  '22': '&l3&rOpening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen
    again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ. &l4&rAnd
    some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks
    a great'
  '23': multitude, and of the chief women not a few. &l5&rBut the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and
  '24': 'sought to bring them out to the people. &l6&rAnd when they found them not,
    they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These
    that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; &l7&rWhom Jason hath
    received: and these'
  '25': all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. &l8&rAnd they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. &l9&rAnd when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let
  '26': 'them go. &l10&rAnd the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
    unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. &l11&rThese
    were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with
    all readiness of'
  '27': mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. &l12&rTherefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few. &l13&rBut when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was
  '28': 'preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.
    &l14&rAnd then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the
    sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still. &l15&rAnd they that conducted
    Paul brought him unto'
  '29': 'Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come
    to him with all speed, they departed. &l16&rNow while Paul waited for them at
    Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
    &l17&rTherefore'
  '30': disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. &l18&rThen certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say?
  '31': 'other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached
    unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. &l19&rAnd they took him, and brought him
    unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest,
    is?'
  '32': '&l20&rFor thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know
    therefore what these things mean. &l21&r(For all the Athenians and strangers which
    were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some
    new thing.)'
  '33': '&l22&rThen Paul stood in the midst of Mars'' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens,
    I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. &l23&rFor as I passed
    by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, To The
    Unknown God. Whom'
  '34': therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. &l24&rGod that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; &l25&rNeither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he
  '35': needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; &l26&rAnd hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
  '36': '&l27&rThat they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him,
    and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: &l28&rFor in him we live,
    and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For
    we are also his'
  '37': offspring. &l29&rForasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device. &l30&rAnd the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men
  '38': 'every where to repent: &l31&rBecause he hath appointed a day, in the which
    he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof
    he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.
    &l32&rAnd when'
  '39': 'they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said,
    We will hear thee again of this matter. &l33&rSo Paul departed from among them.
    &l34&rHowbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius
    the Areopagite,'
  '40': and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
  '41': 'Chapter 18

    After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; &l2&rAnd found
    a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife
    Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:)'
  '42': 'and came unto them. &l3&rAnd because he was of the same craft, he abode with
    them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. &l4&rAnd he reasoned
    in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. &l5&rAnd
    when Silas'
  '43': and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. &l6&rAnd when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I
  '44': am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. &l7&rAnd he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. &l8&rAnd Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue,
  '45': 'believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing
    believed, and were baptized. &l9&rThen spake the Lord to Paul in the night by
    a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: &l10&rFor I am with
    thee, and no man'
  '46': 'shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. &l11&rAnd
    he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
    &l12&rAnd when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with
    one accord against'
  '47': Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, &l13&rSaying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. &l14&rAnd when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye
  '48': 'Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: &l15&rBut if it be a question
    of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of
    such matters. &l16&rAnd he drave them from the judgment seat. &l17&rThen all the
    Greeks took'
  '49': Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. &l18&rAnd Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria,
  '50': 'and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for
    he had a vow. &l19&rAnd he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself
    entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.'

    &l20&rWhen they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;
    &l21&rBut bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that
    cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed'
  '2': from Ephesus. &l22&rAnd when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. &l23&rAnd after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening
  '3': all the disciples. &l24&rAnd a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. &l25&rThis man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught
  '4': 'diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. &l26&rAnd
    he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had
    heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
    &l27&rAnd'
  '5': 'when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the
    disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed
    through grace: &l28&rFor he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, shewing
    by the'
  '6': scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
  '7': 'Chapter 19

    And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through
    the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, &l2&rHe said
    unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto'
  '8': him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. &l3&rAnd he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. &l4&rThen said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the
  '9': people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. &l5&rWhen they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. &l6&rAnd when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and
  '10': they spake with tongues, and prophesied. &l7&rAnd all the men were about twelve. &l8&rAnd he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. &l9&rBut when divers
  '11': were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. &l10&rAnd this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which
  '12': 'dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. &l11&rAnd
    God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: &l12&rSo that from his body
    were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed
    from them, and the'
  '13': evil spirits went out of them. &l13&rThen certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. &l14&rAnd there were seven sons of
  '14': one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. &l15&rAnd the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? &l16&rAnd the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against
  '15': them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. &l17&rAnd this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. &l18&rAnd many that believed came, and
  '16': 'confessed, and shewed their deeds. &l19&rMany of them also which used curious
    arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted
    the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. &l20&rSo mightily
    grew the'
  '17': word of God and prevailed. &l21&rAfter these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. &l22&rSo he sent into Macedonia two of
  '18': them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season. &l23&rAnd the same time there arose no small stir about that way. &l24&rFor a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana,
  '19': brought no small gain unto the craftsmen; &l25&rWhom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. &l26&rMoreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all
  '20': 'Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they
    be no gods, which are made with hands: &l27&rSo that not only this our craft is
    in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana
    should be'
  '21': despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. &l28&rAnd when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. &l29&rAnd the whole city was filled with
  '22': 'confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul''s
    companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre. &l30&rAnd
    when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.
    &l31&rAnd certain of'
  '23': 'the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that
    he would not adventure himself into the theatre. &l32&rSome therefore cried one
    thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew
    not wherefore they'
  '24': were come together. &l33&rAnd they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people. &l34&rBut when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice
  '25': about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. &l35&rAnd when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great
  '26': goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? &l36&rSeeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. &l37&rFor ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches,
  '27': 'nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. &l38&rWherefore if Demetrius, and the
    craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open,
    and there are deputies: let them implead one another. &l39&rBut if ye enquire
    any thing concerning'
  '28': other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. &l40&rFor we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse. &l41&rAnd when he had thus spoken, he dismissed
  '29': the assembly.
  '30': 'Chapter 20

    And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced
    them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. &l2&rAnd when he had gone over those
    parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, &l3&rAnd there'
  '31': abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. &l4&rAnd there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius
  '32': of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. &l5&rThese going before tarried for us at Troas. &l6&rAnd we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.
  '33': '&l7&rAnd upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together
    to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued
    his speech until midnight. &l8&rAnd there were many lights in the upper chamber,
    where they were'
  '34': 'gathered together. &l9&rAnd there sat in a window a certain young man named
    Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk
    down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. &l10&rAnd
    Paul went'
  '35': down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. &l11&rWhen he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. &l12&rAnd they
  '36': 'brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted. &l13&rAnd we
    went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for
    so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot. &l14&rAnd when he met with us
    at Assos, we took'
  '37': him in, and came to Mitylene. &l15&rAnd we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus. &l16&rFor Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus,
  '38': 'because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible
    for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. &l17&rAnd from Miletus he sent
    to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. &l18&rAnd when they were come
    to him, he said'
  '39': 'unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what
    manner I have been with you at all seasons, &l19&rServing the Lord with all humility
    of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in
    wait of the Jews:'
  '40': '&l20&rAnd how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have
    shewed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house, &l21&rTestifying
    both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward
    our Lord Jesus'
  '41': 'Christ. &l22&rAnd now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not
    knowing the things that shall befall me there: &l23&rSave that the Holy Ghost
    witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. &l24&rBut
    none of these things'
  '42': move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. &l25&rAnd now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have
  '43': gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. &l26&rWherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. &l27&rFor I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. &l28&rTake heed therefore unto
  '44': yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. &l29&rFor I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not
  '45': sparing the flock. &l30&rAlso of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. &l31&rTherefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
  '46': '&l32&rAnd now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace,
    which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which
    are sanctified. &l33&rI have coveted no man''s silver, or gold, or apparel. &l34&rYea,
    ye'
  '47': yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. &l35&rI have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is
  '48': more blessed to give than to receive. &l36&rAnd when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. &l37&rAnd they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, &l38&rSorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
  '49': should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.

  '6': and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. &l12&rAnd when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him
  '7': not to go up to Jerusalem. &l13&rThen Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. &l14&rAnd when he would not be persuaded, we ceased,
  '8': saying, The will of the Lord be done. &l15&rAnd after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem. &l16&rThere went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom
  '9': we should lodge. &l17&rAnd when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. &l18&rAnd the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present. &l19&rAnd when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
  '10': 'things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. &l20&rAnd when
    they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother,
    how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of
    the law: &l21&rAnd'
  '11': they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. &l22&rWhat is it therefore? the multitude must needs come
  '12': 'together: for they will hear that thou art come. &l23&rDo therefore this
    that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; &l24&rThem take,
    and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave
    their heads: and all'
  '13': may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law. &l25&rAs touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such
  '14': thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication. &l26&rThen Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the
  '15': accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them. &l27&rAnd when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid
  '16': 'hands on him, &l28&rCrying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that
    teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place:
    and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.
    &l29&r(For they had'
  '17': 'seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed
    that Paul had brought into the temple.) &l30&rAnd all the city was moved, and
    the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and
    forthwith the doors'
  '18': 'were shut. &l31&rAnd as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the
    chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. &l32&rWho immediately
    took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief
    captain and'
  '19': 'the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. &l33&rThen the chief captain came
    near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded
    who he was, and what he had done. &l34&rAnd some cried one thing, some another,
    among the multitude:'
  '20': and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle. &l35&rAnd when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people. &l36&rFor the multitude of the
  '21': people followed after, crying, Away with him. &l37&rAnd as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? &l38&rArt not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an
  '22': 'uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
    &l39&rBut Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a
    citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.
    &l40&rAnd'
  '23': when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
  '24': 'Chapter 22

    Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you. &l2&r(And
    when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more
    silence: and he saith,) &l3&rI am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus,
    a'
  '25': city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day. &l4&rAnd I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and
  '26': 'delivering into prisons both men and women. &l5&rAs also the high priest
    doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received
    letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there
    bound unto Jerusalem,'
  '27': for to be punished. &l6&rAnd it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me. &l7&rAnd I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul,
  '28': Saul, why persecutest thou me? &l8&rAnd I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. &l9&rAnd they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that
  '29': spake to me. &l10&rAnd I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. &l11&rAnd when I could not see for the glory of that light,
  '30': being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus. &l12&rAnd one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there, &l13&rCame unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive
  '31': thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him. &l14&rAnd he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth. &l15&rFor thou shalt be his witness unto all
  '32': men of what thou hast seen and heard. &l16&rAnd now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. &l17&rAnd it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple,
  '33': 'I was in a trance; &l18&rAnd saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get
    thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning
    me. &l19&rAnd I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue
    them that'
  '34': 'believed on thee: &l20&rAnd when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed,
    I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of
    them that slew him. &l21&rAnd he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far
    hence unto the'
  '35': 'Gentiles. &l22&rAnd they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted
    up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not
    fit that he should live. &l23&rAnd as they cried out, and cast off their clothes,
    and threw dust'
  '36': into the air, &l24&rThe chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him. &l25&rAnd as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the
  '37': 'centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a
    Roman, and uncondemned? &l26&rWhen the centurion heard that, he went and told
    the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
    &l27&rThen the chief'
  '38': captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. &l28&rAnd the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born. &l29&rThen straightway they departed from him which should have
  '39': 'examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he
    was a Roman, and because he had bound him. &l30&rOn the morrow, because he would
    have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from
    his bands, and'
  '40': commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
  '41': 'Chapter 23

    And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived
    in all good conscience before God until this day. &l2&rAnd the high priest Ananias
    commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. &l3&rThen said Paul'
  '42': 'unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge
    me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? &l4&rAnd
    they that stood by said, Revilest thou God''s high priest? &l5&rThen said Paul,
    I wist not, brethren,'
  '43': 'that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil
    of the ruler of thy people. &l6&rBut when Paul perceived that the one part were
    Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren,
    I am a Pharisee,'
  '44': 'the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called
    in question. &l7&rAnd when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
    Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided. &l8&rFor the Sadducees
    say that there is'
  '45': 'no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
    &l9&rAnd there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees''
    part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or
    an angel hath spoken'
  '46': to him, let us not fight against God. &l10&rAnd when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring
  '47': 'him into the castle. &l11&rAnd the night following the Lord stood by him,
    and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem,
    so must thou bear witness also at Rome. &l12&rAnd when it was day, certain of
    the Jews banded'
  '48': together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. &l13&rAnd they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy. &l14&rAnd they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have
  '49': bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul. &l15&rNow therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly
  '50': 'concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him. &l16&rAnd
    when Paul''s sister''s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into
    the castle, and told Paul.'

    &l17&rThen Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young
    man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him. &l18&rSo
    he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner'
  '2': called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee. &l19&rThen the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me? &l20&rAnd he
  '3': 'said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul
    to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more
    perfectly. &l21&rBut do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him
    of them more than'
  '4': 'forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither
    eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a
    promise from thee. &l22&rSo the chief captain then let the young man depart, and
    charged him, See'
  '5': thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me. &l23&rAnd he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
  '6': '&l24&rAnd provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe
    unto Felix the governor. &l25&rAnd he wrote a letter after this manner: &l26&rClaudius
    Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting. &l27&rThis man
    was taken of'
  '7': 'the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and
    rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman. &l28&rAnd when I would have
    known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
    &l29&rWhom I'
  '8': perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. &l30&rAnd when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers
  '9': 'also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell. &l31&rThen the
    soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
    &l32&rOn the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the
    castle:'
  '10': '&l33&rWho, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor,
    presented Paul also before him. &l34&rAnd when the governor had read the letter,
    he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;
    &l35&rI will'
  '11': hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
  '12': 'Chapter 24

    And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with
    a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul. &l2&rAnd
    when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by'
  '13': thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, &l3&rWe accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. &l4&rNotwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I
  '14': 'pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. &l5&rFor
    we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the
    Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: &l6&rWho
    also hath gone'
  '15': 'about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according
    to our law. &l7&rBut the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence
    took him away out of our hands, &l8&rCommanding his accusers to come unto thee:
    by examining of'
  '16': whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. &l9&rAnd the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so. &l10&rThen Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that
  '17': 'thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully
    answer for myself: &l11&rBecause that thou mayest understand, that there are yet
    but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. &l12&rAnd they neither
    found me in'
  '18': 'the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither
    in the synagogues, nor in the city: &l13&rNeither can they prove the things whereof
    they now accuse me. &l14&rBut this I confess unto thee, that after the way which
    they call heresy,'
  '19': 'so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written
    in the law and in the prophets: &l15&rAnd have hope toward God, which they themselves
    also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and
    unjust.'
  '20': '&l16&rAnd herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to
    offence toward God, and toward men. &l17&rNow after many years I came to bring
    alms to my nation, and offerings. &l18&rWhereupon certain Jews from Asia found
    me purified in the'
  '21': temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. &l19&rWho ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me. &l20&rOr else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
  '22': '&l21&rExcept it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them,
    Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
    &l22&rAnd when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that
    way, he deferred them,'
  '23': and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. &l23&rAnd he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto
  '24': him. &l24&rAnd after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. &l25&rAnd as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and
  '25': 'answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will
    call for thee. &l26&rHe hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
    that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with
    him. &l27&rBut'
  '26': 'after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix'' room: and Felix, willing
    to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.'
  '27': 'Chapter 25

    Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from
    Caesarea to Jerusalem. &l2&rThen the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed
    him against Paul, and besought him, &l3&rAnd desired favour against him, that
    he'
  '28': would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him. &l4&rBut Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither. &l5&rLet them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with
  '29': me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him. &l6&rAnd when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought. &l7&rAnd when he was come, the
  '30': Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove. &l8&rWhile he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against
  '31': Caesar, have I offended any thing at all. &l9&rBut Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? &l10&rThen said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat,
  '32': 'where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very
    well knowest. &l11&rFor if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy
    of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these
    accuse me, no man'
  '33': may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar. &l12&rThen Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go. &l13&rAnd after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to
  '34': 'salute Festus. &l14&rAnd when they had been there many days, Festus declared
    Paul''s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:
    &l15&rAbout whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of
    the Jews informed'
  '35': me, desiring to have judgment against him. &l16&rTo whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime
  '36': laid against him. &l17&rTherefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth. &l18&rAgainst whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things
  '37': 'as I supposed: &l19&rBut had certain questions against him of their own superstition,
    and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. &l20&rAnd because
    I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem,'
  '38': and there be judged of these matters. &l21&rBut when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar. &l22&rThen Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To
  '39': morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. &l23&rAnd on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought
  '40': forth. &l24&rAnd Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. &l25&rBut
  '41': when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him. &l26&rOf whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and
  '42': specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write. &l27&rFor it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.
  '43': 'Chapter 26

    Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul
    stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself: &l2&rI think myself happy,
    king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching
    all the'
  '44': 'things whereof I am accused of the Jews: &l3&rEspecially because I know thee
    to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore
    I beseech thee to hear me patiently. &l4&rMy manner of life from my youth, which
    was at the first'
  '45': among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; &l5&rWhich knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. &l6&rAnd now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made
  '46': 'of God, unto our fathers: &l7&rUnto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly
    serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope''s sake, king Agrippa,
    I am accused of the Jews. &l8&rWhy should it be thought a thing incredible with
    you, that God'
  '47': 'should raise the dead? &l9&rI verily thought with myself, that I ought to
    do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. &l10&rWhich thing I
    also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having
    received authority from'
  '48': the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. &l11&rAnd I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.
  '49': '&l12&rWhereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from
    the chief priests, &l13&rAt midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven,
    above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed
    with me. &l14&rAnd'
  '50': when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

    purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which'

    unto them of'

  '9': 'day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. &l30&rAnd
    when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and
    they that sat with them: &l31&rAnd when they were gone aside, they talked between
    themselves,'
  '10': saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. &l32&rThen said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
  '11': 'Chapter 27

    And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul
    and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus'' band.
    &l2&rAnd entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by
    the'
  '12': coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. &l3&rAnd the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself. &l4&rAnd when we had launched
  '13': from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. &l5&rAnd when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. &l6&rAnd there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he
  '14': put us therein. &l7&rAnd when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone; &l8&rAnd, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens;
  '15': nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. &l9&rNow when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, &l10&rAnd said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much
  '16': damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives. &l11&rNevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. &l12&rAnd because the haven was not commodious to winter in,
  '17': the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west. &l13&rAnd when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
  '18': obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete. &l14&rBut not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon. &l15&rAnd when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive. &l16&rAnd
  '19': 'running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to
    come by the boat: &l17&rWhich when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding
    the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail,
    and so were'
  '20': driven. &l18&rAnd we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship; &l19&rAnd the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. &l20&rAnd when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small
  '21': tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away. &l21&rBut after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm
  '22': 'and loss. &l22&rAnd now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall
    be no loss of any man''s life among you, but of the ship. &l23&rFor there stood
    by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, &l24&rSaying,
    Fear not, Paul; thou'
  '23': 'must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that
    sail with thee. &l25&rWherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that
    it shall be even as it was told me. &l26&rHowbeit we must be cast upon a certain
    island. &l27&rBut'
  '24': 'when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria,
    about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country; &l28&rAnd
    sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further,
    they sounded again,'
  '25': and found it fifteen fathoms. &l29&rThen fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. &l30&rAnd as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the
  '26': sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, &l31&rPaul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. &l32&rThen the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall
  '27': 'off. &l33&rAnd while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take
    meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued
    fasting, having taken nothing. &l34&rWherefore I pray you to take some meat: for
    this is for your'
  '28': 'health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. &l35&rAnd
    when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of
    them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat. &l36&rThen were they all
    of good cheer, and'
  '29': 'they also took some meat. &l37&rAnd we were in all in the ship two hundred
    threescore and sixteen souls. &l38&rAnd when they had eaten enough, they lightened
    the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. &l39&rAnd when it was day, they
    knew not the land:'
  '30': but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. &l40&rAnd when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up
  '31': the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore. &l41&rAnd falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. &l42&rAnd
  '32': the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape. &l43&rBut the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea,
  '33': 'and get to land: &l44&rAnd the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces
    of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.'
  '34': 'Chapter 28

    And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
    &l2&rAnd the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a
    fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the
    cold.'
  '35': '&l3&rAnd when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the
    fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. &l4&rAnd when
    the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves,
    No doubt this man'
  '36': 'is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth
    not to live. &l5&rAnd he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
    &l6&rHowbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly:
    but after they'
  '37': had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. &l7&rIn the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days
  '38': 'courteously. &l8&rAnd it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick
    of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid
    his hands on him, and healed him. &l9&rSo when this was done, others also, which
    had diseases in the'
  '39': 'island, came, and were healed: &l10&rWho also honoured us with many honours;
    and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. &l11&rAnd
    after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in
    the isle, whose'
  '40': 'sign was Castor and Pollux. &l12&rAnd landing at Syracuse, we tarried there
    three days. &l13&rAnd from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and
    after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: &l14&rWhere
    we found'
  '41': 'brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went
    toward Rome. &l15&rAnd from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
    meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked
    God, and took'
  '42': 'courage. &l16&rAnd when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
    to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a
    soldier that kept him. &l17&rAnd it came to pass, that after three days Paul called
    the chief of'
  '43': 'the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men
    and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of
    our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the
    Romans. &l18&rWho,'
  '44': when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. &l19&rBut when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. &l20&rFor this cause therefore have
  '45': 'I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the
    hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. &l21&rAnd they said unto him, We neither
    received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that
    came shewed or'
  '46': 'spake any harm of thee. &l22&rBut we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest:
    for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. &l23&rAnd
    when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to
    whom he'
  '47': expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening. &l24&rAnd some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. &l25&rAnd when they
  '48': agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, &l26&rSaying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye
  '49': 'shall see, and not perceive: &l27&rFor the heart of this people is waxed
    gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest
    they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with
    their heart, and should'
  '50': be converted, and I should heal them. &l28&rBe it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.
