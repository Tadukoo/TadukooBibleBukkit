  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,
    &l2&rTo the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace
    be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. &l3&rWe
    give'
  '2': thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, &l4&rSince we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints, &l5&rFor the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before
  '3': 'in the word of the truth of the gospel; &l6&rWhich is come unto you, as it
    is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the
    day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth: &l7&rAs ye also learned
    of Epaphras our dear'
  '4': fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; &l8&rWho also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. &l9&rFor this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the
  '5': knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; &l10&rThat ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; &l11&rStrengthened with all might, according to his
  '6': 'glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; &l12&rGiving
    thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance
    of the saints in light: &l13&rWho hath delivered us from the power of darkness,
    and hath'
  '7': 'translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: &l14&rIn whom we have redemption
    through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: &l15&rWho is the image of the
    invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: &l16&rFor by him were all things
    created, that'
  '8': 'are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they
    be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created
    by him, and for him: &l17&rAnd he is before all things, and by him all things
    consist. &l18&rAnd he is'
  '9': 'the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from
    the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. &l19&rFor it pleased
    the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; &l20&rAnd, having made peace
    through the blood of'
  '10': his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. &l21&rAnd you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled &l22&rIn the body
  '11': 'of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable
    in his sight: &l23&rIf ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not
    moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached
    to every'
  '12': 'creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; &l24&rWho
    now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the
    afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body''s sake, which is the church: &l25&rWhereof
    I am made a'
  '13': 'minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you,
    to fulfil the word of God; &l26&rEven the mystery which hath been hid from ages
    and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: &l27&rTo whom God
    would make known'
  '14': 'what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which
    is Christ in you, the hope of glory: &l28&rWhom we preach, warning every man,
    and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in
    Christ Jesus:'
  '15': '&l29&rWhereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh
    in me mightily.'
  '16': 'Chapter 2

    For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea,
    and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; &l2&rThat their hearts
    might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full'
  '17': assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; &l3&rIn whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. &l4&rAnd this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. &l5&rFor
  '18': 'though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying
    and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. &l6&rAs
    ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: &l7&rRooted
    and built up in him,'
  '19': and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. &l8&rBeware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. &l9&rFor in
  '20': 'him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. &l10&rAnd ye are complete
    in him, which is the head of all principality and power: &l11&rIn whom also ye
    are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body
    of the sins of'
  '21': 'the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: &l12&rBuried with him in baptism,
    wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God,
    who hath raised him from the dead. &l13&rAnd you, being dead in your sins and
    the uncircumcision of'
  '22': your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; &l14&rBlotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; &l15&rAnd having
  '23': 'spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing
    over them in it. &l16&rLet no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or
    in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: &l17&rWhich
    are a shadow of'
  '24': things to come; but the body is of Christ. &l18&rLet no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, &l19&rAnd not holding the
  '25': Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God. &l20&rWherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye
  '26': subject to ordinances, &l21&r(Touch not; taste not; handle not; &l22&rWhich all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men? &l23&rWhich things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the
  '27': 'body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.'
  '28': 'Chapter 3

    If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ
    sitteth on the right hand of God. &l2&rSet your affection on things above, not
    on things on the earth. &l3&rFor ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ
    in God.'
  '29': ' &l4&rWhen Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear
    with him in glory. &l5&rMortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;
    fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness,
    which is'
  '30': 'idolatry: &l6&rFor which things'' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children
    of disobedience: &l7&rIn the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in
    them. &l8&rBut now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,
    filthy communication'
  '31': 'out of your mouth. &l9&rLie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off
    the old man with his deeds; &l10&rAnd have put on the new man, which is renewed
    in knowledge after the image of him that created him: &l11&rWhere there is neither
    Greek nor Jew,'
  '32': 'circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but
    Christ is all, and in all. &l12&rPut on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and
    beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
    &l13&rForbearing'
  '33': 'one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against
    any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. &l14&rAnd above all these things
    put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. &l15&rAnd let the peace of God
    rule in your hearts,'
  '34': to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. &l16&rLet the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
  '35': '&l17&rAnd whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
    Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. &l18&rWives, submit yourselves
    unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. &l19&rHusbands, love your wives,
    and be not'
  '36': 'bitter against them. &l20&rChildren, obey your parents in all things: for
    this is well pleasing unto the Lord. &l21&rFathers, provoke not your children
    to anger, lest they be discouraged. &l22&rServants, obey in all things your masters
    according to the'
  '37': 'flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing
    God; &l23&rAnd whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto
    men; &l24&rKnowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance:
    for ye serve'
  '38': 'the Lord Christ. &l25&rBut he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong
    which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.'
  '39': 'Chapter 4

    Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye
    also have a Master in heaven. &l2&rContinue in prayer, and watch in the same with
    thanksgiving; &l3&rWithal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door
    of'
  '40': 'utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:
    &l4&rThat I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. &l5&rWalk in wisdom toward
    them that are without, redeeming the time. Let your speech be always with grace,
    seasoned with salt,'
  '41': 'that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man. &l6&rnull &l7&rAll my
    state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful
    minister and fellowservant in the Lord: &l8&rWhom I have sent unto you for the
    same purpose, that he'
  '42': might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; &l9&rWith Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here. &l10&rAristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's
  '43': 'son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto
    you, receive him;) &l11&rAnd Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision.
    These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort
    unto me.'
  '44': '&l12&rEpaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always
    labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete
    in all the will of God. &l13&rFor I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal
    for you, and them'
  '45': that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. &l14&rLuke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you. &l15&rSalute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house. &l16&rAnd when this epistle is read among you, cause
  '46': that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea. &l17&rAnd say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. &l18&rThe salutation by the hand of
  '47': me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
