  '1': 'Chapter 1

    In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar
    king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. &l2&rAnd the Lord gave Jehoiakim
    king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which
    he'
  '2': carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. &l3&rAnd the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the
  '3': king's seed, and of the princes; &l4&rChildren in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might
  '4': 'teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. &l5&rAnd the king appointed
    them a daily provision of the king''s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so
    nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the
    king. &l6&rNow'
  '5': 'among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
    Azariah: &l7&rUnto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto
    Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael,
    of Meshach; and to'
  '6': 'Azariah, of Abednego. &l8&rBut Daniel purposed in his heart that he would
    not defile himself with the portion of the king''s meat, nor with the wine which
    he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not
    defile himself.'
  '7': '&l9&rNow God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince
    of the eunuchs. &l10&rAnd the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my
    lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he
    see your faces worse'
  '8': liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king. &l11&rThen said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, &l12&rProve thy servants, I beseech
  '9': 'thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. &l13&rThen
    let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children
    that eat of the portion of the king''s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy
    servants.'
  '10': '&l14&rSo he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. &l15&rAnd
    at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh
    than all the children which did eat the portion of the king''s meat. &l16&rThus
    Melzar took away'
  '11': 'the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave
    them pulse. &l17&rAs for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill
    in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
    &l18&rNow at the'
  '12': 'end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the
    prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. &l19&rAnd the king
    communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael,
    and Azariah:'
  '13': therefore stood they before the king. &l20&rAnd in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. &l21&rAnd Daniel continued even
  '14': unto the first year of king Cyrus.
  '15': 'Chapter 2

    And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams,
    wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. &l2&rThen the
    king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers,
    and'
  '16': the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. &l3&rAnd the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. &l4&rThen spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king,
  '17': 'live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
    &l5&rThe king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if
    ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye
    shall be cut in'
  '18': 'pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. &l6&rBut if ye shew the
    dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards
    and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
    &l7&rThey answered'
  '19': again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. &l8&rThe king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. &l9&rBut if ye will not make
  '20': 'known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared
    lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore
    tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
    &l10&rThe'
  '21': 'Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the
    earth that can shew the king''s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor
    ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. &l11&rAnd
    it is a rare thing'
  '22': that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. &l12&rFor this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. &l13&rAnd
  '23': 'the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought
    Daniel and his fellows to be slain. &l14&rThen Daniel answered with counsel and
    wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king''s guard, which was gone forth to slay
    the wise men of Babylon:'
  '24': ' &l15&rHe answered and said to Arioch the king''s captain, Why is the decree
    so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. &l16&rThen
    Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that
    he would shew the king'
  '25': 'the interpretation. &l17&rThen Daniel went to his house, and made the thing
    known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: &l18&rThat they would
    desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his
    fellows should not'
  '26': 'perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. &l19&rThen was the secret
    revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
    &l20&rDaniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever:
    for wisdom and might are'
  '27': 'his: &l21&rAnd he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings,
    and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that
    know understanding: &l22&rHe revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth
    what is in the darkness,'
  '28': 'and the light dwelleth with him. &l23&rI thank thee, and praise thee, O thou
    God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto
    me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king''s
    matter.'
  '29': '&l24&rTherefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to
    destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the
    wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king
    the interpretation.'
  '30': '&l25&rThen Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus
    unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto
    the king the interpretation. &l26&rThe king answered and said to Daniel, whose
    name was'
  '31': Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? &l27&rDaniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the
  '32': magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king; &l28&rBut there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;
  '33': '&l29&rAs for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed,
    what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known
    to thee what shall come to pass. &l30&rBut as for me, this secret is not revealed
    to me for any wisdom'
  '34': that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart. &l31&rThou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was
  '35': excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible. &l32&rThis image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, &l33&rHis legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. &l34&rThou
  '36': sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. &l35&rThen was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like
  '37': 'the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away,
    that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a
    great mountain, and filled the whole earth. &l36&rThis is the dream; and we will
    tell the interpretation'
  '38': 'thereof before the king. &l37&rThou, O king, art a king of kings: for the
    God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. &l38&rAnd
    wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of
    the heaven hath he'
  '39': given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold. &l39&rAnd after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. &l40&rAnd the fourth
  '40': 'kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and
    subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces
    and bruise. &l41&rAnd whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters''
    clay, and part of'
  '41': iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. &l42&rAnd as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong,
  '42': 'and partly broken. &l43&rAnd whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay,
    they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one
    to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. &l44&rAnd in the days of these
    kings shall the God'
  '43': 'of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom
    shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all
    these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. &l45&rForasmuch as thou sawest that
    the stone was cut'
  '44': 'out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron,
    the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to
    the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the
    interpretation thereof'
  '45': sure. &l46&rThen the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him. &l47&rThe king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods,
  '46': and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret. &l48&rThen the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all
  '47': 'the wise men of Babylon. &l49&rThen Daniel requested of the king, and he
    set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon:
    but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.'
  '48': 'Chapter 3

    Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits,
    and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the
    province of Babylon. &l2&rThen Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together
    the'
  '49': princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. &l3&rThen the princes, the governors,
  '50': and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that

    Nebuchadnezzar had set up. &l5&rThat at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet,
    flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down
    and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:'
  '2': '&l6&rAnd whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast
    into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. &l7&rTherefore at that time, when all
    the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and
    all kinds of musick,'
  '3': all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. &l8&rWherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews. &l9&rThey spake and said to the king
  '4': 'Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever. &l10&rThou, O king, hast made a decree,
    that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut,
    psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the
    golden image:'
  '5': '&l11&rAnd whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into
    the midst of a burning fiery furnace. &l12&rThere are certain Jews whom thou hast
    set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego;
    these men, O'
  '6': 'king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden
    image which thou hast set up. &l13&rThen Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded
    to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the
    king.'
  '7': '&l14&rNebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach,
    and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have
    set up? &l15&rNow if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet,
    flute,'
  '8': 'harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down
    and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall
    be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that
    God that shall'
  '9': deliver you out of my hands? &l16&rShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. &l17&rIf it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
  '10': furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. &l18&rBut if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. &l19&rThen was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of
  '11': 'his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore
    he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more
    than it was wont to be heated. &l20&rAnd he commanded the most mighty men that
    were in his army to bind'
  '12': Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. &l21&rThen these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
  '13': '&l22&rTherefore because the king''s commandment was urgent, and the furnace
    exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach,
    and Abednego. &l23&rAnd these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell
    down bound into'
  '14': the midst of the burning fiery furnace. &l24&rThen Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king,
  '15': True, O king. &l25&rHe answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. &l26&rThen Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace,
  '16': and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire. &l27&rAnd the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's
  '17': counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them. &l28&rThen Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said,
  '18': Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
  '19': '&l29&rTherefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language,
    which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
    shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there
    is no other God that'
  '20': can deliver after this sort. &l30&rThen the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.
  '21': 'Chapter 4

    Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in
    all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. &l2&rI thought it good to shew the
    signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me. &l3&rHow great are
    his'
  '22': 'signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
    and his dominion is from generation to generation. &l4&rI Nebuchadnezzar was at
    rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace: &l5&rI saw a dream which made
    me afraid, and the'
  '23': thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. &l6&rTherefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream. &l7&rThen came in the magicians, the
  '24': 'astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before
    them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. &l8&rBut
    at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to
    the name of my God,'
  '25': 'and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream,
    saying, &l9&rO Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the
    spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the
    visions of my dream'
  '26': that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof. &l10&rThus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. &l11&rThe tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached
  '27': 'unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: &l12&rThe
    leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all:
    the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt
    in the boughs'
  '28': thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. &l13&rI saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven; &l14&rHe cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves,
  '29': 'and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls
    from his branches: &l15&rNevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth,
    even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let
    it be wet with the'
  '30': 'dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the
    earth: &l16&rLet his heart be changed from man''s, and let a beast''s heart be
    given unto him; and let seven times pass over him. &l17&rThis matter is by the
    decree of the watchers,'
  '31': 'and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living
    may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever
    he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men. &l18&rThis dream I king Nebuchadnezzar
    have'
  '32': 'seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch
    as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation:
    but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. &l19&rThen Daniel,
    whose'
  '33': name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate
  '34': thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies. &l20&rThe tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; &l21&rWhose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and
  '35': 'in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon
    whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: &l22&rIt is thou,
    O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth
    unto heaven, and'
  '36': thy dominion to the end of the earth. &l23&rAnd whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and
  '37': brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him; &l24&rThis is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which
  '38': 'is come upon my lord the king: &l25&rThat they shall drive thee from men,
    and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee
    to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven
    times shall pass over'
  '39': thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. &l26&rAnd whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the
  '40': heavens do rule. &l27&rWherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. &l28&rAll this came upon the king
  '41': Nebuchadnezzar. &l29&rAt the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. &l30&rThe king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of
  '42': my majesty? &l31&rWhile the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee. &l32&rAnd they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the
  '43': 'beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven
    times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom
    of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. &l33&rThe same hour was the thing
    fulfilled upon'
  '44': 'Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and
    his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles''
    feathers, and his nails like birds'' claws. &l34&rAnd at the end of the days I
    Nebuchadnezzar lifted'
  '45': 'up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I
    blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose
    dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:
    &l35&rAnd all'
  '46': 'the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according
    to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and
    none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? &l36&rAt the same time
    my reason returned'
  '47': unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me. &l37&rNow I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol
  '48': 'and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment:
    and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.'
  '49': 'Chapter 5

    Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine
    before the thousand. &l2&rBelshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to

    and his concubines, drank in them. &l4&rThey drank wine, and praised the gods'
  '2': 'of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. &l5&rIn
    the same hour came forth fingers of a man''s hand, and wrote over against the
    candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king''s palace: and the king
    saw the part of the hand'
  '3': that wrote. &l6&rThen the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. &l7&rThe king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the
  '4': soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the
  '5': 'kingdom. &l8&rThen came in all the king''s wise men: but they could not read
    the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof. &l9&rThen
    was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him,
    and his lords were'
  '6': 'astonied. &l10&rNow the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords
    came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever:
    let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed: &l11&rThere
    is a man in'
  '7': thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the
  '8': magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; &l12&rForasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king
  '9': 'named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.
    &l13&rThen was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said
    unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity
    of Judah, whom'
  '10': the king my father brought out of Jewry? &l14&rI have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee. &l15&rAnd now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in
  '11': 'before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the
    interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:
    &l16&rAnd I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve
    doubts: now if'
  '12': thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom. &l17&rThen Daniel answered and said before the king, Let
  '13': thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. &l18&rO thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and
  '14': 'honour: &l19&rAnd for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations,
    and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom
    he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put
    down. &l20&rBut when his'
  '15': 'heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from
    his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: &l21&rAnd he was driven from
    the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was
    with the wild asses:'
  '16': they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will. &l22&rAnd thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine
  '17': heart, though thou knewest all this; &l23&rBut hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast
  '18': 'praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which
    see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose
    are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified: &l24&rThen was the part of the hand
    sent from him; and'
  '19': 'this writing was written. &l25&rAnd this is the writing that was written,
    Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin. &l26&rThis is the interpretation of the thing: Mene;
    God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. &l27&rTekel; Thou art weighed
    in the balances, and'
  '20': art found wanting. &l28&rPeres; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. &l29&rThen commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he
  '21': should be the third ruler in the kingdom. &l30&rIn that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. &l31&rAnd Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.
  '22': 'Chapter 6

    It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which
    should be over the whole kingdom; &l2&rAnd over these three presidents; of whom
    Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king
    should'
  '23': have no damage. &l3&rThen this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. &l4&rThen the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel
  '24': concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him. &l5&rThen said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against
  '25': him concerning the law of his God. &l6&rThen these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever. &l7&rAll the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the
  '26': captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. &l8&rNow, O king, establish the
  '27': decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. &l9&rWherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree. &l10&rNow when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his
  '28': house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. &l11&rThen these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
  '29': supplication before his God. &l12&rThen they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be
  '30': cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. &l13&rThen answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of
  '31': 'Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed,
    but maketh his petition three times a day. &l14&rThen the king, when he heard
    these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to
    deliver him: and he'
  '32': laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him. &l15&rThen these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
  '33': '&l16&rThen the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into
    the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest
    continually, he will deliver thee. &l17&rAnd a stone was brought, and laid upon
    the mouth of the'
  '34': 'den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his
    lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. &l18&rThen the
    king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments
    of musick brought'
  '35': 'before him: and his sleep went from him. &l19&rThen the king arose very early
    in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. &l20&rAnd when he came
    to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and
    said to Daniel, O'
  '36': Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? &l21&rThen said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. &l22&rMy God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they
  '37': 'have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and
    also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. &l23&rThen was the king exceedingly
    glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So
    Daniel was taken up'
  '38': out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God. &l24&rAnd the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives;
  '39': and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den. &l25&rThen king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. &l26&rI
  '40': 'make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear
    before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and
    his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even
    unto the end. &l27&rHe'
  '41': delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. &l28&rSo this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
  '42': 'Chapter 7

    In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions
    of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.
    &l2&rDaniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four'
  '43': 'winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. &l3&rAnd four great beasts
    came up from the sea, diverse one from another. &l4&rThe first was like a lion,
    and had eagle''s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was
    lifted up from the'
  '44': 'earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man''s heart was given
    to it. &l5&rAnd behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised
    up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth
    of it: and they said'
  '45': thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. &l6&rAfter this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. &l7&rAfter this I saw in the night visions,
  '46': 'and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly;
    and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the
    residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were
    before it; and it had ten'
  '47': 'horns. &l8&rI considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
    another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up
    by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a
    mouth speaking great'
  '48': 'things. &l9&rI beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
    days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the
    pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
    &l10&rA fiery stream'
  '49': 'issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto
    him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set,
    and the books were opened. &l11&rI beheld then because of the voice of the great
    words which the horn'
  '50': 'spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and
    given to the burning flame. &l12&rAs concerning the rest of the beasts, they had
    their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.'

    &l13&rI saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with
    the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near
    before him. &l14&rAnd there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,'
  '2': 'that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is
    an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which
    shall not be destroyed. &l15&rI Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of
    my body, and the'
  '3': visions of my head troubled me. &l16&rI came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. &l17&rThese great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall
  '4': arise out of the earth. &l18&rBut the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. &l19&rThen I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding
  '5': dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; &l20&rAnd of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that
  '6': horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. &l21&rI beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; &l22&rUntil the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given
  '7': to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. &l23&rThus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall
  '8': 'tread it down, and break it in pieces. &l24&rAnd the ten horns out of this
    kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and
    he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. &l25&rAnd
    he shall speak great'
  '9': 'words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High,
    and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until
    a time and times and the dividing of time. &l26&rBut the judgment shall sit, and
    they shall take'
  '10': away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. &l27&rAnd the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
  '11': 'and all dominions shall serve and obey him. &l28&rHitherto is the end of
    the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance
    changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.'
  '12': 'Chapter 8

    In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even
    unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. &l2&rAnd I saw
    in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace,'
  '13': 'which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the
    river of Ulai. &l3&rThen I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
    before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one
    was higher than the'
  '14': other, and the higher came up last. &l4&rI saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
  '15': '&l5&rAnd as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the
    face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable
    horn between his eyes. &l6&rAnd he came to the ram that had two horns, which I
    had seen standing'
  '16': 'before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. &l7&rAnd I saw
    him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote
    the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before
    him, but he'
  '17': 'cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that
    could deliver the ram out of his hand. &l8&rTherefore the he goat waxed very great:
    and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable
    ones toward'
  '18': the four winds of heaven. &l9&rAnd out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. &l10&rAnd it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of
  '19': the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. &l11&rYea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down. &l12&rAnd an host was given him
  '20': against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered. &l13&rThen I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the
  '21': vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? &l14&rAnd he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
  '22': '&l15&rAnd it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and
    sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance
    of a man. &l16&rAnd I heard a man''s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called,
    and said, Gabriel,'
  '23': 'make this man to understand the vision. &l17&rSo he came near where I stood:
    and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand,
    O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision. &l18&rNow as he
    was speaking'
  '24': 'with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched
    me, and set me upright. &l19&rAnd he said, Behold, I will make thee know what
    shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end
    shall be. &l20&rThe ram'
  '25': 'which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. &l21&rAnd
    the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes
    is the first king. &l22&rNow that being broken, whereas four stood up for it,
    four kingdoms'
  '26': shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. &l23&rAnd in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. &l24&rAnd his power shall be
  '27': 'mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall
    prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. &l25&rAnd
    through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall
    magnify'
  '28': 'himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand
    up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. &l26&rAnd
    the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut
    thou up the vision;'
  '29': for it shall be for many days. &l27&rAnd I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.
  '30': 'Chapter 9

    In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which
    was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; &l2&rIn the first year of his reign
    I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the'
  '31': 'Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years
    in the desolations of Jerusalem. &l3&rAnd I set my face unto the Lord God, to
    seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: &l4&rAnd
    I prayed unto the'
  '32': Lord my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments; &l5&rWe have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and
  '33': 'have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:
    &l6&rNeither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in
    thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of
    the land. &l7&rO Lord,'
  '34': righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them,
  '35': because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. &l8&rO Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee. &l9&rTo the Lord our God belong mercies and
  '36': forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him; &l10&rNeither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. &l11&rYea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing,
  '37': that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him. &l12&rAnd he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and
  '38': 'against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for
    under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. &l13&rAs
    it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we
    not our prayer'
  '39': 'before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand
    thy truth. &l14&rTherefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil, and brought it
    upon us: for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for
    we obeyed not his'
  '40': voice. &l15&rAnd now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. &l16&rO Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I
  '41': 'beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem,
    thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers,
    Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us. &l17&rNow
    therefore,'
  '42': O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake. &l18&rO my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city
  '43': 'which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before
    thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. &l19&rO Lord, hear; O
    Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God:
    for thy city and thy'

  '45': prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. &l22&rAnd he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee
  '46': 'skill and understanding. &l23&rAt the beginning of thy supplications the
    commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved:
    therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision. &l24&rSeventy weeks
    are determined upon thy'
  '47': people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. &l25&rKnow
  '48': 'therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to
    restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks,
    and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even
    in troublous times.'

  '50': 'desolations are determined. &l27&rAnd he shall confirm the covenant with
    many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and

    In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose
    name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was
    long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the'

    &l5&rThen I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed
    in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz: &l6&rHis body also
    was like the beryl, and'
  '4': 'his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and
    his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words
    like the voice of a multitude. &l7&rAnd I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the
    men that were with'
  '5': 'me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled
    to hide themselves. &l8&rTherefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision,
    and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into
    corruption, and I'
  '6': 'retained no strength. &l9&rYet heard I the voice of his words: and when I
    heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face
    toward the ground. &l10&rAnd, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my
    knees and upon the'
  '7': 'palms of my hands. &l11&rAnd he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved,
    understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee
    am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. &l12&rThen
    said he unto'
  '8': 'me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart
    to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and
    I am come for thy words. &l13&rBut the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood
    me one and twenty'
  '9': 'days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained
    there with the kings of Persia. &l14&rNow I am come to make thee understand what
    shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.
    &l15&rAnd'
  '10': 'when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and
    I became dumb. &l16&rAnd, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched
    my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before
    me, O my lord,'
  '11': by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. &l17&rFor how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me. &l18&rThen
  '12': 'there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he
    strengthened me, &l19&rAnd said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto
    thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened,
    and said, Let my'
  '13': 'lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me. &l20&rThen said he, Knowest thou
    wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of
    Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come. &l21&rBut
    I will shew thee that'
  '14': 'which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth
    with me in these things, but Michael your prince.'
  '15': 'Chapter 11

    Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen
    him. &l2&rAnd now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet
    three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and'
  '16': by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia. &l3&rAnd a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. &l4&rAnd when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
  '17': 'shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity,
    nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked
    up, even for others beside those. &l5&rAnd the king of the south shall be strong,
    and one of his'
  '18': princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion. &l6&rAnd in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an
  '19': 'agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he
    stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and
    he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times. &l7&rBut out of
    a branch of her roots'
  '20': 'shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall
    enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them,
    and shall prevail: &l8&rAnd shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with
    their princes, and'
  '21': with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north. &l9&rSo the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land. &l10&rBut his sons shall be stirred up, and shall
  '22': 'assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow,
    and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.
    &l11&rAnd the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth
    and fight'
  '23': 'with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great
    multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand. &l12&rAnd when he hath
    taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down
    many ten thousands:'
  '24': but he shall not be strengthened by it. &l13&rFor the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches. &l14&rAnd in those times
  '25': 'there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers
    of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
    &l15&rSo the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most
    fenced cities:'
  '26': 'and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people,
    neither shall there be any strength to withstand. &l16&rBut he that cometh against
    him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he
    shall stand in the'
  '27': 'glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed. &l17&rHe shall also set
    his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with
    him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting
    her: but she shall'
  '28': 'not stand on his side, neither be for him. &l18&rAfter this shall he turn
    his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf
    shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he
    shall cause it to turn'
  '29': 'upon him. &l19&rThen he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land:
    but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found. &l20&rThen shall stand up in
    his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days
    he shall be destroyed,'
  '30': 'neither in anger, nor in battle. &l21&rAnd in his estate shall stand up a
    vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall
    come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. &l22&rAnd with the arms
    of a flood shall'
  '31': 'they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince
    of the covenant. &l23&rAnd after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully:
    for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people. &l24&rHe shall
    enter'
  '32': 'peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that
    which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers'' fathers; he shall scatter among
    them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against
    the strong'
  '33': 'holds, even for a time. &l25&rAnd he shall stir up his power and his courage
    against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall
    be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand:
    for they shall'
  '34': 'forecast devices against him. &l26&rYea, they that feed of the portion of
    his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down
    slain. &l27&rAnd both of these kings'' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they
    shall speak lies at'
  '35': 'one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time
    appointed. &l28&rThen shall he return into his land with great riches; and his
    heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return
    to his own land.'
  '36': '&l29&rAt the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but
    it shall not be as the former, or as the latter. &l30&rFor the ships of Chittim
    shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation
    against the'
  '37': 'holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence
    with them that forsake the holy covenant. &l31&rAnd arms shall stand on his part,
    and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily
    sacrifice, and they'
  '38': 'shall place the abomination that maketh desolate. &l32&rAnd such as do wickedly
    against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know
    their God shall be strong, and do exploits. &l33&rAnd they that understand among
    the people'
  '39': 'shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity,
    and by spoil, many days. &l34&rNow when they shall fall, they shall be holpen
    with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. &l35&rAnd some
    of them of'
  '40': 'understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white,
    even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed. &l36&rAnd
    the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify
    himself above every'
  '41': 'god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall
    prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall
    be done. &l37&rNeither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire
    of women, nor regard any'
  '42': 'god: for he shall magnify himself above all. &l38&rBut in his estate shall
    he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour
    with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things. &l39&rThus
    shall he do in the'
  '43': 'most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase
    with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land
    for gain. &l40&rAnd at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
    him: and the king'
  '44': of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over. &l41&rHe shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall
  '45': 'be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab,
    and the chief of the children of Ammon. &l42&rHe shall stretch forth his hand
    also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape. &l43&rBut he
    shall have power over'
  '46': 'the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of
    Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps. &l44&rBut tidings
    out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go
    forth with great fury'
  '47': to destroy, and utterly to make away many. &l45&rAnd he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.
  '48': 'Chapter 12

    And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the
    children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was
    since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall'
  '49': be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. &l2&rAnd many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. &l3&rAnd they that be wise shall shine as the
  '50': 'brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as
    the stars for ever and ever. &l4&rBut thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal
    the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge
    shall be increased.'

    &l5&rThen I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this
    side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.
    &l6&rAnd one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of'
