  '1': 'Chapter 1

    These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the
    wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel,
    and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. &l2&r(There are eleven days'' journey from
    Horeb by'
  '2': the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.) &l3&rAnd it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto
  '3': 'them; &l4&rAfter he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt
    in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: &l5&rOn
    this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
    &l6&rThe Lord our God'
  '4': 'spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount: &l7&rTurn
    you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all
    the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in
    the south, and'
  '5': 'by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the
    great river, the river Euphrates. &l8&rBehold, I have set the land before you:
    go in and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
    and Jacob, to give'
  '6': 'unto them and to their seed after them. &l9&rAnd I spake unto you at that
    time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone: &l10&rThe Lord your God
    hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
    &l11&r(The Lord'
  '7': God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!) &l12&rHow can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? &l13&rTake you wise men, and understanding, and known among
  '8': your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. &l14&rAnd ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do. &l15&rSo I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over
  '9': thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes. &l16&rAnd I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man
  '10': 'and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. &l17&rYe shall not respect
    persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall
    not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God''s: and the cause that
    is too hard for'
  '11': you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it. &l18&rAnd I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do. &l19&rAnd when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of
  '12': 'the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.
    &l20&rAnd I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which
    the Lord our God doth give unto us. &l21&rBehold, the Lord thy God hath set the
    land before thee:'
  '13': go up and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged. &l22&rAnd ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word
  '14': 'again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come. &l23&rAnd
    the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe: &l24&rAnd
    they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol,
    and searched'
  '15': it out. &l25&rAnd they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us. &l26&rNotwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
  '16': 'commandment of the Lord your God: &l27&rAnd ye murmured in your tents, and
    said, Because the Lord hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,
    to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. &l28&rWhither shall
    we go up? our'
  '17': brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there. &l29&rThen I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
  '18': '&l30&rThe Lord your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according
    to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; &l31&rAnd in the wilderness,
    where thou hast seen how that the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his
    son, in'
  '19': all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place. &l32&rYet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God, &l33&rWho went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye
  '20': should go, and in a cloud by day. &l34&rAnd the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying, &l35&rSurely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers.
  '21': '&l36&rSave Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I
    give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath
    wholly followed the Lord. &l37&rAlso the Lord was angry with me for your sakes,
    saying, Thou also shalt'
  '22': 'not go in thither. &l38&rBut Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before
    thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit
    it. &l39&rMoreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your
    children, which in'
  '23': that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. &l40&rBut as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. &l41&rThen ye answered
  '24': and said unto me, We have sinned against the Lord, we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill. &l42&rAnd the Lord said unto me,
  '25': Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies. &l43&rSo I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord, and went presumptuously up into the hill. &l44&rAnd
  '26': the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah. &l45&rAnd ye returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.
  '27': '&l46&rSo ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode
    there.'
  '28': 'Chapter 2

    Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red
    sea, as the Lord spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days. &l2&rAnd
    the Lord spake unto me, saying, &l3&rYe have compassed this mountain long enough:
    turn'
  '29': 'you northward. &l4&rAnd command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through
    the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they
    shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: &l5&rMeddle
    not with them;'
  '30': for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession. &l6&rYe shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may
  '31': 'drink. &l7&rFor the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
    hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years
    the Lord thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. &l8&rAnd when
    we passed by from our'
  '32': brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. &l9&rAnd the Lord said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with
  '33': 'them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession;
    because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession. &l10&rThe Emims
    dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;
    &l11&rWhich also'
  '34': were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims. &l12&rThe Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto
  '35': the land of his possession, which the Lord gave unto them. &l13&rNow rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered. &l14&rAnd the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was
  '36': thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the Lord sware unto them. &l15&rFor indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.
  '37': '&l16&rSo it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead
    from among the people, &l17&rThat the Lord spake unto me, saying, &l18&rThou art
    to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: &l19&rAnd when thou comest
    nigh over against the'
  '38': 'children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not
    give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have
    given it unto the children of Lot for a possession. &l20&r(That also was accounted
    a land of giants:'
  '39': 'giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
    &l21&rA people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the Lord destroyed
    them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: &l22&rAs
    he did to the children'
  '40': 'of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them;
    and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day: &l23&rAnd
    the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came
    forth out of Caphtor,'
  '41': 'destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.) &l24&rRise ye up, take your journey,
    and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the
    Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with
    him in battle.'
  '42': '&l25&rThis day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee
    upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee,
    and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. &l26&rAnd I sent messengers
    out of the'
  '43': 'wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
    &l27&rLet me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither
    turn unto the right hand nor to the left. &l28&rThou shalt sell me meat for money,
    that I may'
  '44': 'eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through
    on my feet; &l29&r(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
    which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land
    which the Lord our'
  '45': 'God giveth us. &l30&rBut Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him:
    for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he
    might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day. &l31&rAnd the Lord said
    unto me, Behold, I'
  '46': 'have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that
    thou mayest inherit his land. &l32&rThen Sihon came out against us, he and all
    his people, to fight at Jahaz. &l33&rAnd the Lord our God delivered him before
    us; and we smote him,'
  '47': 'and his sons, and all his people. &l34&rAnd we took all his cities at that
    time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every
    city, we left none to remain: &l35&rOnly the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves,
    and the'
  '48': 'spoil of the cities which we took. &l36&rFrom Aroer, which is by the brink
    of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead,
    there was not one city too strong for us: the Lord our God delivered all unto
    us: &l37&rOnly unto'
  '49': the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbad us.
  '50': 'Chapter 3

    Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came
    out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.'

    &l2&rAnd the Lord said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all
    his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst
    unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. &l3&rSo the Lord our'
  '2': 'God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people:
    and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. &l4&rAnd we took all his
    cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore
    cities, all the'
  '3': region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. &l5&rAll these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. &l6&rAnd we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men,
  '4': women, and children, of every city. &l7&rBut all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. &l8&rAnd we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river
  '5': of Arnon unto mount Hermon; &l9&r(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;) &l10&rAll the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. &l11&rFor only Og
  '6': king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. &l12&rAnd this
  '7': land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. &l13&rAnd the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto
  '8': the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. &l14&rJair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name,
  '9': Bashanhavothjair, unto this day. &l15&rAnd I gave Gilead unto Machir. &l16&rAnd unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the
  '10': children of Ammon; &l17&rThe plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward. &l18&rAnd I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your God hath given you
  '11': 'this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the
    children of Israel, all that are meet for the war. &l19&rBut your wives, and your
    little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide
    in your cities'
  '12': 'which I have given you; &l20&rUntil the Lord have given rest unto your brethren,
    as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the Lord your
    God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his
    possession, which'
  '13': 'I have given you. &l21&rAnd I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine
    eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall
    the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. &l22&rYe shall not fear
    them: for the Lord'
  '14': 'your God he shall fight for you. &l23&rAnd I besought the Lord at that time,
    saying, &l24&rO Lord God, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and
    thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according
    to thy works,'
  '15': 'and according to thy might? &l25&rI pray thee, let me go over, and see the
    good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. &l26&rBut
    the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the Lord
    said unto me, Let it'
  '16': 'suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. &l27&rGet thee up into
    the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward,
    and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
    &l28&rBut'
  '17': 'charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over
    before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt
    see. &l29&rSo we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.'
  '18': 'Chapter 4

    Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which
    I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land
    which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you. &l2&rYe shall not add unto the
    word'
  '19': 'which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may
    keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you. &l3&rYour eyes
    have seen what the Lord did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed
    Baalpeor, the Lord thy'

  '21': whither ye go to possess it. &l6&rKeep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. &l7&rFor
  '22': what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for? &l8&rAnd what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you
  '23': 'this day? &l9&rOnly take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest
    thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy
    heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons'' sons;
    &l10&rSpecially the'
  '24': day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach
  '25': 'their children. &l11&rAnd ye came near and stood under the mountain; and
    the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds,
    and thick darkness. &l12&rAnd the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the
    fire: ye heard the voice'
  '26': of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice. &l13&rAnd he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. &l14&rAnd the Lord commanded me at that time to
  '27': teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. &l15&rTake ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of
  '28': 'the fire: &l16&rLest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image,
    the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female, &l17&rThe likeness
    of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth
    in the air, &l18&rThe'
  '29': 'likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish
    that is in the waters beneath the earth: &l19&rAnd lest thou lift up thine eyes
    unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all
    the host of heaven,'
  '30': shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven. &l20&rBut the Lord hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people
  '31': 'of inheritance, as ye are this day. &l21&rFurthermore the Lord was angry
    with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I
    should not go in unto that good land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an
    inheritance: &l22&rBut I'
  '32': 'must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and
    possess that good land. &l23&rTake heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant
    of the Lord your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or
    the likeness of'
  '33': any thing, which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee. &l24&rFor the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God. &l25&rWhen thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt
  '34': 'yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall
    do evil in the sight of the Lord thy God, to provoke him to anger: &l26&rI call
    heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish
    from off the'
  '35': land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed. &l27&rAnd the Lord shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the Lord shall
  '36': lead you. &l28&rAnd there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. &l29&rBut if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and
  '37': with all thy soul. &l30&rWhen thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice; &l31&r(For the Lord thy God is a merciful God;) he will not
  '38': forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them. &l32&rFor ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven
  '39': unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? &l33&rDid ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? &l34&rOr hath God assayed to go and
  '40': take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
  '41': '&l35&rUnto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the Lord he is
    God; there is none else beside him. &l36&rOut of heaven he made thee to hear his
    voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire;
    and thou heardest'
  '42': his words out of the midst of the fire. &l37&rAnd because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt; &l38&rTo drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier
  '43': 'than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance,
    as it is this day. &l39&rKnow therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart,
    that the Lord he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is
    none else.'
  '44': '&l40&rThou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which
    I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children
    after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the Lord
    thy God giveth thee,'
  '45': for ever. &l41&rThen Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; &l42&rThat the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he
  '46': 'might live: &l43&rNamely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country,
    of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan,
    of the Manassites. &l44&rAnd this is the law which Moses set before the children
    of Israel: &l45&rThese'
  '47': are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt. &l46&rOn this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who
  '48': 'dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they
    were come forth out of Egypt: &l47&rAnd they possessed his land, and the land
    of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan
    toward the sunrising;'
  '49': '&l48&rFrom Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount
    Sion, which is Hermon, &l49&rAnd all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even

  '43': forty days and forty nights; and the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also, and the Lord would not destroy thee. &l11&rAnd the Lord said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto
  '44': their fathers to give unto them. &l12&rAnd now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, &l13&rTo

  '2': acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; &l4&rAnd what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued
  '3': 'after you, and how the Lord hath destroyed them unto this day; &l5&rAnd what
    he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place; &l6&rAnd what
    he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth
    opened her'

    the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel: &l7&rBut
    your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did. &l8&rTherefore
    shall ye keep all'
  '5': the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it; &l9&rAnd that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their
  '6': 'seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey. &l10&rFor the land, whither
    thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came
    out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden
    of herbs: &l11&rBut the'
  '7': 'land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh
    water of the rain of heaven: &l12&rA land which the Lord thy God careth for: the
    eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even
    unto the end'
  '8': of the year. &l13&rAnd it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, &l14&rThat I will give you the rain of
  '9': your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. &l15&rAnd I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full. &l16&rTake heed to yourselves,
  '10': that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; &l17&rAnd then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish
  '11': quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you. &l18&rTherefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. &l19&rAnd ye shall teach them
  '12': 'your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
    thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. &l20&rAnd
    thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:
    &l21&rThat your days'
  '13': may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. &l22&rFor if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love
  '14': the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him; &l23&rThen will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves. &l24&rEvery place whereon the soles of your feet
  '15': 'shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river,
    the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. &l25&rThere
    shall no man be able to stand before you: for the Lord your God shall lay the
    fear of you and the'

    unto you. &l26&rBehold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; &l27&rA

    this day: &l28&rAnd a'

  '18': the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. &l30&rAre they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in
  '19': the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? &l31&rFor ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. &l32&rAnd ye shall observe to do all the

  '4': wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, The Lord Thy God; &l59&rThen the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues,
  '5': and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. &l60&rMoreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. &l61&rAlso every sickness, and every plague, which is not
  '6': written in the book of this law, them will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed. &l62&rAnd ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the Lord thy God.
  '7': '&l63&rAnd it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do
    you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you,
    and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither
    thou goest to possess'
  '8': it. &l64&rAnd the Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone. &l65&rAnd among these nations shalt
  '9': 'thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the Lord
    shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:
    &l66&rAnd thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and
    night, and shalt'
  '10': 'have none assurance of thy life: &l67&rIn the morning thou shalt say, Would
    God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the
    fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes
    which thou shalt'
  '11': 'see. &l68&rAnd the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by
    the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there
    ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall
    buy you.'
  '12': 'Chapter 29

    These are the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to make with
    the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made
    with them in Horeb. &l2&rAnd Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them,
    Ye have'
  '13': 'seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh,
    and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; &l3&rThe great temptations which
    thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles: &l4&rYet the Lord hath
    not given'
  '14': 'you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.
    &l5&rAnd I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen
    old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot. &l6&rYe have not eaten
    bread, neither'
  '15': 'have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the Lord
    your God. &l7&rAnd when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and
    Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them: &l8&rAnd
    we took their'
  '16': land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. &l9&rKeep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do. &l10&rYe stand this day all of you before
  '17': 'the Lord your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers,
    with all the men of Israel, &l11&rYour little ones, your wives, and thy stranger

    the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day: &l13&rThat he may establish thee to
    day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath
    said unto thee, and'
  '19': as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. &l14&rNeither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; &l15&rBut with him that standeth here with us this day before the Lord our God, and also with him that is not here

  '26': 'Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the Lord overthrew in his anger, and in
    his wrath: &l24&rEven all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus
    unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger? &l25&rThen men shall
    say, Because they have'
  '27': 'forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, which he made with
    them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: &l26&rFor they went
    and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom
    he had not given unto'
  '28': 'them: &l27&rAnd the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring
    upon it all the curses that are written in this book: &l28&rAnd the Lord rooted
    them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast
    them into'
  '29': 'another land, as it is this day. &l29&rThe secret things belong unto the
    Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children
    for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.'
  '30': 'Chapter 30

    And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing
    and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind
    among all the nations, whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee, &l2&rAnd shalt'
  '31': return unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul; &l3&rThat then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon
  '32': thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee. &l4&rIf any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch
  '33': 'thee: &l5&rAnd the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers
    possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee
    above thy fathers. &l6&rAnd the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and
    the heart of thy'

  '35': obey the voice of the Lord, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day. &l9&rAnd the Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land,

  '37': turn unto the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. &l11&rFor this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. &l12&rIt is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us
  '38': to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? &l13&rNeither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? &l14&rBut the word is very nigh unto thee,
  '39': in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it. &l15&rSee, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; &l16&rIn that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
  '40': 'statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord
    thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it. &l17&rBut
    if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away,
    and worship other'
  '41': gods, and serve them; &l18&rI denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it. &l19&rI call heaven and earth to record this day against
  '42': 'you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore
    choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: &l20&rThat thou mayest love
    the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave

    And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. &l2&rAnd he said unto them,
    I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in:
    also the Lord hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. &l3&rThe

    forsake thee: fear not,'
  '49': neither be dismayed. &l9&rAnd Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and unto all the elders of Israel. &l10&rAnd Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven
  '50': years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, &l11&rWhen all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.

  '21': 'kept him as the apple of his eye. &l11&rAs an eagle stirreth up her nest,
    fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them

  '25': whom your fathers feared not. &l18&rOf the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee. &l19&rAnd when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. &l20&rAnd he said, I
  '26': 'will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they
    are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith. &l21&rThey have moved
    me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with

  '27': I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. &l22&rFor a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on

    the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely,
    and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.
    &l28&rFor they'

  '32': 'their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up? &l31&rFor their
    rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges. &l32&rFor their
    vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are
    grapes of gall, their'

    sword, and mine hand'
  '37': take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. &l42&rI will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning
  '38': 'of revenges upon the enemy. &l43&rRejoice, O ye nations, with his people:
    for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his
    adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people. &l44&rAnd
    Moses came and spake all'
  '39': 'the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son
    of Nun. &l45&rAnd Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:
    &l46&rAnd he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify
    among you this day,'
  '40': 'which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this
    law. &l47&rFor it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through
    this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to
    possess it.'
  '41': '&l48&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, &l49&rGet
    thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab,
    that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto
    the children of Israel'
  '42': 'for a possession: &l50&rAnd die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be
    gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered
    unto his people: &l51&rBecause ye trespassed against me among the children of
    Israel at the waters'
  '43': of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. &l52&rYet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
  '44': 'Chapter 33

    And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children
    of Israel before his death. &l2&rAnd he said, The Lord came from Sinai, and rose
    up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten'
  '45': 'thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them. &l3&rYea,
    he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy
    feet; every one shall receive of thy words. &l4&rMoses commanded us a law, even
    the inheritance of'

    of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together. &l6&rLet Reuben
    live, and not die; and let not his men be few. &l7&rAnd this is the blessing of
    Judah: and he said,'
  '47': 'Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands
    be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies. &l8&rAnd of
    Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst
    prove at Massah,'
  '48': 'and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; &l9&rWho said unto
    his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge
    his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and
    kept thy covenant.'
  '49': '&l10&rThey shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall
    put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. &l11&rBless,
    Lord, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins
    of them that rise'
  '50': against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. &l12&rAnd of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.

    of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the
    bush: let'
  '3': 'the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of
    him that was separated from his brethren. &l17&rHis glory is like the firstling
    of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall
    push the people'
  '4': 'together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim,
    and they are the thousands of Manasseh. &l18&rAnd of Zebulun he said, Rejoice,
    Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents. &l19&rThey shall call
    the people unto the'
  '5': 'mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall
    suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand. &l20&rAnd
    of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth
    the arm with'
  '6': the crown of the head. &l21&rAnd he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord, and his judgments with Israel. &l22&rAnd of
  '7': 'Dan he said, Dan is a lion''s whelp: he shall leap from Bashan. &l23&rAnd
    of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing
    of the Lord: possess thou the west and the south. &l24&rAnd of Asher he said,
    Let Asher be blessed'
  '8': with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil. &l25&rThy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be. &l26&rThere is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy
  '9': 'help, and in his excellency on the sky. &l27&rThe eternal God is thy refuge,
    and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from
    before thee; and shall say, Destroy them. &l28&rIsrael then shall dwell in safety
    alone: the'
  '10': 'fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens
    shall drop down dew. &l29&rHappy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O
    people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy
    excellency! and thine'
  '11': enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.
  '12': 'Chapter 34

    And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top
    of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the Lord shewed him all the land
    of Gilead, unto Dan, &l2&rAnd all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh,
    and'
  '13': all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, &l3&rAnd the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. &l4&rAnd the Lord said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I
  '14': 'will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes,
    but thou shalt not go over thither. &l5&rSo Moses the servant of the Lord died
    there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. &l6&rAnd he buried
    him in a valley in the'
  '15': 'land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre
    unto this day. &l7&rAnd Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died:
    his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. &l8&rAnd the children of Israel
    wept for Moses in'
  '16': 'the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses
    were ended. &l9&rAnd Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for
    Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him,
    and did as the'
  '17': Lord commanded Moses. &l10&rAnd there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, &l11&rIn all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and
  '18': to all his land, &l12&rAnd in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.
