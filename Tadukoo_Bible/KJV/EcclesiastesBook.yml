  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. &l2&rVanity of
    vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. &l3&rWhat profit
    hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? &l4&rOne generation'
  '2': 'passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
    &l5&rThe sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where
    he arose. &l6&rThe wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north;
    it whirleth'
  '3': about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. &l7&rAll the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. &l8&rAll things are full of labour; man cannot
  '4': 'utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
    &l9&rThe thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done
    is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. &l10&rIs
    there any thing'
  '5': whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. &l11&rThere is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after. &l12&rI the
  '6': 'Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. &l13&rAnd I gave my heart to seek
    and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this
    sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. &l14&rI
    have seen all'
  '7': 'the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation
    of spirit. &l15&rThat which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which
    is wanting cannot be numbered. &l16&rI communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo,
    I am come to'
  '8': 'great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before
    me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. &l17&rAnd
    I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that
    this also'
  '9': 'is vexation of spirit. &l18&rFor in much wisdom is much grief: and he that
    increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.'
  '10': 'Chapter 2

    I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy
    pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity. &l2&rI said of laughter, It is mad:
    and of mirth, What doeth it? &l3&rI sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine,
    yet'
  '11': acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. &l4&rI made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
  '12': 'vineyards: &l5&rI made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them
    of all kind of fruits: &l6&rI made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood
    that bringeth forth trees: &l7&rI got me servants and maidens, and had servants
    born in my house;'
  '13': 'also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were
    in Jerusalem before me: &l8&rI gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar
    treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers,
    and the delights of'
  '14': 'the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts. &l9&rSo I
    was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also
    my wisdom remained with me. &l10&rAnd whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not
    from them, I withheld not'
  '15': 'my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was
    my portion of all my labour. &l11&rThen I looked on all the works that my hands
    had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was
    vanity and vexation'
  '16': 'of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun. &l12&rAnd I turned myself
    to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh
    after the king? even that which hath been already done. &l13&rThen I saw that
    wisdom excelleth folly,'
  '17': 'as far as light excelleth darkness. &l14&rThe wise man''s eyes are in his
    head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event
    happeneth to them all. &l15&rThen said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool,
    so it happeneth'
  '18': even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. &l16&rFor there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth
  '19': 'the wise man? as the fool. &l17&rTherefore I hated life; because the work
    that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation
    of spirit. &l18&rYea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because
    I should leave'
  '20': it unto the man that shall be after me. &l19&rAnd who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.
  '21': '&l20&rTherefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour
    which I took under the sun. &l21&rFor there is a man whose labour is in wisdom,
    and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall
    he leave it for'
  '22': his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. &l22&rFor what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? &l23&rFor all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not
  '23': rest in the night. This is also vanity. &l24&rThere is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. &l25&rFor who can eat, or who
  '24': 'else can hasten hereunto, more than I? &l26&rFor God giveth to a man that
    is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth
    travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before
    God. This also is'
  '25': vanity and vexation of spirit.
  '26': 'Chapter 3

    To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
    &l2&rA time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck
    up that which is planted; &l3&rA time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break'
  '27': down, and a time to build up; &l4&rA time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; &l5&rA time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; &l6&rA time to
  '28': get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; &l7&rA time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; &l8&rA time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. &l9&rWhat profit hath he
  '29': 'that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? &l10&rI have seen the travail,
    which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. &l11&rHe hath made
    every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart,
    so that no man can'
  '30': find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. &l12&rI know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life. &l13&rAnd also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it
  '31': 'is the gift of God. &l14&rI know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be
    for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth
    it, that men should fear before him. &l15&rThat which hath been is now; and that
    which is to be hath'
  '32': already been; and God requireth that which is past. &l16&rAnd moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there. &l17&rI said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous
  '33': 'and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every
    work. &l18&rI said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that
    God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
    &l19&rFor that which'
  '34': 'befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them:
    as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a
    man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. &l20&rAll go unto one
    place; all are of the'
  '35': dust, and all turn to dust again. &l21&rWho knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? &l22&rWherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works;
  '36': 'for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after
    him?'
  '37': 'Chapter 4

    So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun:
    and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and
    on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.'
  '38': '&l2&rWherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living
    which are yet alive. &l3&rYea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet
    been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. &l4&rAgain,
    I considered all'
  '39': travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. &l5&rThe fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. &l6&rBetter is an handful with quietness, than both the hands
  '40': 'full with travail and vexation of spirit. &l7&rThen I returned, and I saw
    vanity under the sun. &l8&rThere is one alone, and there is not a second; yea,
    he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither
    is his eye satisfied'
  '41': with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. &l9&rTwo are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. &l10&rFor if they fall, the one will lift up
  '42': 'his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not
    another to help him up. &l11&rAgain, if two lie together, then they have heat:
    but how can one be warm alone? &l12&rAnd if one prevail against him, two shall
    withstand him; and a'
  '43': threefold cord is not quickly broken. &l13&rBetter is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished. &l14&rFor out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor. &l15&rI
  '44': 'considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child
    that shall stand up in his stead. &l16&rThere is no end of all the people, even
    of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice
    in him. Surely this'
  '45': also is vanity and vexation of spirit.
  '46': 'Chapter 5

    Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear,
    than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.
    &l2&rBe not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any
    thing'
  '47': 'before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy
    words be few. &l3&rFor a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a
    fool''s voice is known by multitude of words. &l4&rWhen thou vowest a vow unto
    God, defer not to pay it;'
  '48': 'for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. &l5&rBetter
    is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. &l6&rSuffer
    not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that
    it was'
  '49': 'an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work
    of thine hands? &l7&rFor in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also
    divers vanities: but fear thou God. &l8&rIf thou seest the oppression of the poor,
    and violent'
  '50': 'perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter:
    for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.
    &l9&rMoreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by
    the field.'

  '1': 'Chapter 5 Cont.

    &l10&rHe that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth
    abundance with increase: this is also vanity. &l11&rWhen goods increase, they
    are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof,'
  '2': 'saving the beholding of them with their eyes? &l12&rThe sleep of a labouring
    man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will
    not suffer him to sleep. &l13&rThere is a sore evil which I have seen under the
    sun, namely, riches'
  '3': 'kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. &l14&rBut those riches perish by
    evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand. &l15&rAs
    he came forth of his mother''s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and
    shall take nothing'
  '4': 'of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. &l16&rAnd this also is
    a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath
    he that hath laboured for the wind? &l17&rAll his days also he eateth in darkness,
    and he hath much'
  '5': 'sorrow and wrath with his sickness. &l18&rBehold that which I have seen: it
    is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his
    labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth
    him: for it is his'
  '6': portion. &l19&rEvery man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God. &l20&rFor he shall not much remember the days of his life;
  '7': because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.
  '8': 'Chapter 6

    There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:
    &l2&rA man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth
    nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to
    eat'
  '9': 'thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
    &l3&rIf a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days
    of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have
    no burial; I say,'
  '10': 'that an untimely birth is better than he. &l4&rFor he cometh in with vanity,
    and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness. &l5&rMoreover
    he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other.
    &l6&rYea,'
  '11': 'though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do
    not all go to one place? &l7&rAll the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet
    the appetite is not filled. &l8&rFor what hath the wise more than the fool? what
    hath the poor, that'
  '12': 'knoweth to walk before the living? &l9&rBetter is the sight of the eyes than
    the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit. &l10&rThat
    which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may
    he contend with'
  '13': him that is mightier than he. &l11&rSeeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better? &l12&rFor who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what
  '14': shall be after him under the sun?
  '15': 'Chapter 7

    A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day
    of one''s birth. &l2&rIt is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go
    to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will
    lay it to'
  '16': 'his heart. &l3&rSorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
    countenance the heart is made better. &l4&rThe heart of the wise is in the house
    of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. &l5&rIt is better
    to hear the rebuke of'
  '17': 'the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. &l6&rFor as the crackling
    of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity. &l7&rSurely
    oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. &l8&rBetter
    is the end'
  '18': 'of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better
    than the proud in spirit. &l9&rBe not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger
    resteth in the bosom of fools. &l10&rSay not thou, What is the cause that the
    former days were'
  '19': 'better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this. &l11&rWisdom
    is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.
    &l12&rFor wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge
    is,'
  '20': 'that wisdom giveth life to them that have it. &l13&rConsider the work of
    God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked? &l14&rIn the
    day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath
    set the one over against'
  '21': 'the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. &l15&rAll things
    have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his
    righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.
    &l16&rBe not'
  '22': 'righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy
    thyself? &l17&rBe not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest
    thou die before thy time? &l18&rIt is good that thou shouldest take hold of this;
    yea, also from'
  '23': 'this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of
    them all. &l19&rWisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are
    in the city. &l20&rFor there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
    sinneth not.'
  '24': '&l21&rAlso take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy
    servant curse thee: &l22&rFor oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou
    thyself likewise hast cursed others. &l23&rAll this have I proved by wisdom: I
    said, I will be wise;'
  '25': but it was far from me. &l24&rThat which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? &l25&rI applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and
  '26': 'madness: &l26&rAnd I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is
    snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from
    her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. &l27&rBehold, this have I found, saith
    the preacher,'
  '27': 'counting one by one, to find out the account: &l28&rWhich yet my soul seeketh,
    but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those
    have I not found. &l29&rLo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;
    but they'
  '28': have sought out many inventions.
  '29': 'Chapter 8

    Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man''s
    wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.
    &l2&rI counsel thee to keep the king''s commandment, and that in regard of the
    oath of'
  '30': 'God. &l3&rBe not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing;
    for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. &l4&rWhere the word of a king is, there
    is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou? &l5&rWhoso keepeth the commandment
    shall feel no'
  '31': 'evil thing: and a wise man''s heart discerneth both time and judgment. &l6&rBecause
    to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great
    upon him. &l7&rFor he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when
    it shall'
  '32': 'be? &l8&rThere is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit;
    neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war;
    neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it. &l9&rAll this have
    I seen, and'
  '33': 'applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time
    wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. &l10&rAnd so I saw the wicked
    buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten
    in the city'
  '34': 'where they had so done: this is also vanity. &l11&rBecause sentence against
    an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men
    is fully set in them to do evil. &l12&rThough a sinner do evil an hundred times,
    and his days be'
  '35': 'prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God,
    which fear before him: &l13&rBut it shall not be well with the wicked, neither
    shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before
    God. &l14&rThere is a'
  '36': 'vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it
    happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to
    whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also
    is vanity. &l15&rThen I'
  '37': 'commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to
    eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour
    the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun. &l16&rWhen I applied
    mine heart to know'
  '38': 'wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there
    is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) &l17&rThen I beheld
    all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the
    sun: because though a'
  '39': man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.
  '40': 'Chapter 9

    For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous,
    and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love
    or hatred by all that is before them. &l2&rAll things come alike to all: there'
  '41': 'is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the
    clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth
    not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth
    an oath. &l3&rThis is'
  '42': 'an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event
    unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness
    is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. &l4&rFor
    to him that is'
  '43': 'joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a
    dead lion. &l5&rFor the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
    any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
    &l6&rAlso their'
  '44': love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. &l7&rGo thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.
  '45': ' &l8&rLet thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.
    &l9&rLive joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of
    thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity:
    for that is thy portion'
  '46': in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun. &l10&rWhatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. &l11&rI returned, and saw under
  '47': the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. &l12&rFor man also knoweth not his
  '48': 'time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that
    are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
    falleth suddenly upon them. &l13&rThis wisdom have I seen also under the sun,
    and it seemed great unto'
  '49': 'me: &l14&rThere was a little city, and few men within it; and there came
    a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:
    &l15&rNow there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered
    the city; yet no man'
  '50': 'remembered that same poor man. &l16&rThen said I, Wisdom is better than strength:
    nevertheless the poor man''s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
    &l17&rThe words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth
    among fools.'

    Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour:
    so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. &l2&rA
    wise man''s heart is at his right hand; but a fool''s heart at his left. &l3&rYea
    also,'
  '3': when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. &l4&rIf the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences. &l5&rThere is an evil which I
  '4': 'have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: &l6&rFolly
    is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. &l7&rI have seen servants
    upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. &l8&rHe that diggeth
    a pit shall'
  '5': fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him. &l9&rWhoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. &l10&rIf the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to
  '6': 'more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. &l11&rSurely the serpent
    will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. &l12&rThe words of
    a wise man''s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
    &l13&rThe beginning'
  '7': 'of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous
    madness. &l14&rA fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
    and what shall be after him, who can tell him? &l15&rThe labour of the foolish
    wearieth every one'
  '8': of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. &l16&rWoe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! &l17&rBlessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for
  '9': 'strength, and not for drunkenness! &l18&rBy much slothfulness the building
    decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through. &l19&rA
    feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.
    &l20&rCurse not'
  '10': 'the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber:
    for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell
    the matter.'
  '11': 'Chapter 11

    Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. &l2&rGive
    a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be
    upon the earth. &l3&rIf the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon
    the'
  '12': 'earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the
    place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. &l4&rHe that observeth the wind
    shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. &l5&rAs thou knowest
    not what is the'
  '13': 'way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with
    child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all. &l6&rIn the morning
    sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not
    whether shall'
  '14': 'prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. &l7&rTruly
    the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:
    &l8&rBut if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember
    the days of'
  '15': 'darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. &l9&rRejoice,
    O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth,
    and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know
    thou, that for all'
  '16': 'these things God will bring thee into judgment. &l10&rTherefore remove sorrow
    from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are
    vanity.'
  '17': 'Chapter 12

    Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not,
    nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; &l2&rWhile
    the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the'
  '18': 'clouds return after the rain: &l3&rIn the day when the keepers of the house
    shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease
    because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, &l4&rAnd
    the doors shall be'
  '19': shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low; &l5&rAlso when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and
  '20': 'the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and
    desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about
    the streets: &l6&rOr ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken,
    or the pitcher be'
  '21': 'broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. &l7&rThen shall
    the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who
    gave it. &l8&rVanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity. &l9&rAnd
    moreover, because the'
  '22': 'preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good
    heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs. &l10&rThe preacher sought
    to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words
    of truth. &l11&rThe'
  '23': 'words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies,
    which are given from one shepherd. &l12&rAnd further, by these, my son, be admonished:
    of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.'
  '24': '&l13&rLet us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep
    his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. &l14&rFor God shall bring
    every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether
    it be evil.'
