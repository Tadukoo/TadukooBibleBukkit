    Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at
    Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: &l2&rGrace be to you, and peace,
    from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. &l3&rBlessed be the God and
    Father'
  '2': 'of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings
    in heavenly places in Christ: &l4&rAccording as he hath chosen us in him before
    the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him
    in love: &l5&rHaving'
  '3': predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, &l6&rTo the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. &l7&rIn whom we have redemption through
  '4': his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; &l8&rWherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; &l9&rHaving made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in
  '5': 'himself: &l10&rThat in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather
    together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are
    on earth; even in him: &l11&rIn whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
    predestinated'
  '6': 'according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of
    his own will: &l12&rThat we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted
    in Christ. &l13&rIn whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth,
    the gospel of'
  '7': 'your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that
    holy Spirit of promise, &l14&rWhich is the earnest of our inheritance until the
    redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. &l15&rWherefore
    I also,'
  '8': after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, &l16&rCease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; &l17&rThat the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of
  '9': 'wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: &l18&rThe eyes of your understanding
    being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what
    the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, &l19&rAnd what is the
    exceeding'
  '10': greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, &l20&rWhich he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, &l21&rFar above all principality, and
  '11': 'power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
    this world, but also in that which is to come: &l22&rAnd hath put all things under
    his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, &l23&rWhich
    is his body, the'
  '12': fulness of him that filleth all in all.
  '13': 'Chapter 2

    And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; &l2&rWherein
    in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the
    prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of'
  '14': 'disobedience: &l3&rAmong whom also we all had our conversation in times past
    in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind;
    and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. &l4&rBut God, who is
    rich in mercy, for'
  '15': 'his great love wherewith he loved us, &l5&rEven when we were dead in sins,
    hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) &l6&rAnd hath
    raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:
    &l7&rThat in the'
  '16': 'ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness
    toward us through Christ Jesus. &l8&rFor by grace are ye saved through faith;
    and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: &l9&rNot of works, lest any
    man should boast.'
  '17': '&l10&rFor we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
    which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. &l11&rWherefore remember,
    that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision
    by that which'
  '18': 'is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; &l12&rThat at that
    time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and
    strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the
    world: &l13&rBut now in'
  '19': Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. &l14&rFor he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; &l15&rHaving abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law
  '20': 'of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain
    one new man, so making peace; &l16&rAnd that he might reconcile both unto God
    in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: &l17&rAnd came and
    preached peace to you which'
  '21': were afar off, and to them that were nigh. &l18&rFor through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. &l19&rNow therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; &l20&rAnd are
  '22': 'built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself
    being the chief corner stone; &l21&rIn whom all the building fitly framed together
    groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: &l22&rIn whom ye also are builded together
    for an'
  '23': habitation of God through the Spirit.
  '24': 'Chapter 3

    For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, &l2&rIf
    ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
    &l3&rHow that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore
    in'
  '25': few words, &l4&rWhereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) &l5&rWhich in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; &l6&rThat the
  '26': 'Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his
    promise in Christ by the gospel: &l7&rWhereof I was made a minister, according
    to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his
    power. &l8&rUnto me, who'
  '27': am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; &l9&rAnd to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in
  '28': 'God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: &l10&rTo the intent that now
    unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church
    the manifold wisdom of God, &l11&rAccording to the eternal purpose which he purposed
    in Christ'
  '29': 'Jesus our Lord: &l12&rIn whom we have boldness and access with confidence
    by the faith of him. &l13&rWherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations
    for you, which is your glory. &l14&rFor this cause I bow my knees unto the Father
    of our Lord Jesus'
  '30': Christ, &l15&rOf whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, &l16&rThat he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; &l17&rThat Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith;
  '31': that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, &l18&rMay be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; &l19&rAnd to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness
  '32': of God. &l20&rNow unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, &l21&rUnto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.
  '33': 'Chapter 4

    I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the
    vocation wherewith ye are called, &l2&rWith all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering,
    forbearing one another in love; &l3&rEndeavouring to keep the unity of the'
  '34': Spirit in the bond of peace. &l4&rThere is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; &l5&rOne Lord, one faith, one baptism, &l6&rOne God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. &l7&rBut unto
  '35': every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. &l8&rWherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. &l9&r(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first
  '36': into the lower parts of the earth? &l10&rHe that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) &l11&rAnd he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
  '37': ' &l12&rFor the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for
    the edifying of the body of Christ: &l13&rTill we all come in the unity of the
    faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
    of the stature of'
  '38': 'the fulness of Christ: &l14&rThat we henceforth be no more children, tossed
    to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men,
    and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; &l15&rBut speaking
    the truth in love,'
  '39': 'may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: &l16&rFrom
    whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint
    supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh
    increase of'
  '40': the body unto the edifying of itself in love. &l17&rThis I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, &l18&rHaving the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of
  '41': 'God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their
    heart: &l19&rWho being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness,
    to work all uncleanness with greediness. &l20&rBut ye have not so learned Christ;
    &l21&rIf so'
  '42': 'be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in
    Jesus: &l22&rThat ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which
    is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; &l23&rAnd be renewed in the spirit
    of your mind;'
  '43': '&l24&rAnd that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness
    and true holiness. &l25&rWherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with
    his neighbour: for we are members one of another. &l26&rBe ye angry, and sin not:
    let not'
  '44': 'the sun go down upon your wrath: &l27&rNeither give place to the devil. &l28&rLet
    him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands
    the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. &l29&rLet
    no corrupt'
  '45': communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. &l30&rAnd grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. &l31&rLet all bitterness,
  '46': 'and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you,
    with all malice: &l32&rAnd be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving
    one another, even as God for Christ''s sake hath forgiven you.'
  '47': 'Chapter 5

    Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; &l2&rAnd walk in love, as
    Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice
    to God for a sweetsmelling savour. &l3&rBut fornication, and all uncleanness,
    or'
  '48': 'covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; &l4&rNeither
    filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather
    giving of thanks. &l5&rFor this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person,
    nor'
  '49': 'covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of
    Christ and of God. &l6&rLet no man deceive you with vain words: for because of
    these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. &l7&rBe
    not ye therefore'
  '50': 'partakers with them. &l8&rFor ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye
    light in the Lord: walk as children of light: &l9&r(For the fruit of the Spirit
    is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) &l10&rProving what is acceptable
    unto the Lord.'

    &l11&rAnd have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
    reprove them. &l12&rFor it is a shame even to speak of those things which are
    done of them in secret. &l13&rBut all things that are reproved are made manifest
    by'
  '2': 'the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. &l14&rWherefore he
    saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give
    thee light. &l15&rSee then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
    &l16&rRedeeming the'
  '3': time, because the days are evil. &l17&rWherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. &l18&rAnd be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; &l19&rSpeaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and
  '4': spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; &l20&rGiving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; &l21&rSubmitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. &l22&rWives, submit
  '5': 'yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. &l23&rFor the husband
    is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the
    saviour of the body. &l24&rTherefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so
    let the wives be to'
  '6': their own husbands in every thing. &l25&rHusbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; &l26&rThat he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, &l27&rThat he might present it to himself
  '7': a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. &l28&rSo ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. &l29&rFor no man ever yet hated his own
  '8': 'flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: &l30&rFor
    we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. &l31&rFor this cause
    shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and
    they two shall'
  '9': 'be one flesh. &l32&rThis is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ
    and the church. &l33&rNevertheless let every one of you in particular so love
    his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.'
  '10': 'Chapter 6

    Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. &l2&rHonour thy father
    and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; &l3&rThat it may be well
    with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. &l4&rAnd, ye fathers, provoke'
  '11': 'not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition
    of the Lord. &l5&rServants, be obedient to them that are your masters according
    to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
    &l6&rNot with'
  '12': 'eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will
    of God from the heart; &l7&rWith good will doing service, as to the Lord, and
    not to men: &l8&rKnowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall
    he receive of the'
  '13': 'Lord, whether he be bond or free. &l9&rAnd, ye masters, do the same things
    unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven;
    neither is there respect of persons with him. &l10&rFinally, my brethren, be strong
    in the Lord, and'
  '14': in the power of his might. &l11&rPut on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. &l12&rFor we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness
  '15': of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. &l13&rWherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. &l14&rStand therefore, having your loins girt about with
  '16': truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; &l15&rAnd your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; &l16&rAbove all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. &l17&rAnd take
  '17': 'the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of
    God: &l18&rPraying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and
    watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; &l19&rAnd
    for me, that'

    known the mystery of the gospel, &l20&rFor which I am an ambassador in bonds:
    that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. &l21&rBut that ye also may
    know my affairs, and how'
