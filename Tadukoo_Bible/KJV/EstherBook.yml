  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned,
    from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
    &l2&rThat in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom,'
  '2': 'which was in Shushan the palace, &l3&rIn the third year of his reign, he made
    a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media,
    the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him: &l4&rWhen he shewed
    the riches of his'
  '3': glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days. &l5&rAnd when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small,
  '4': 'seven days, in the court of the garden of the king''s palace; &l6&rWhere were
    white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple
    to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon
    a pavement of red, and'
  '5': blue, and white, and black, marble. &l7&rAnd they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king. &l8&rAnd the drinking was according to the law; none did
  '6': 'compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that
    they should do according to every man''s pleasure. &l9&rAlso Vashti the queen
    made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
    &l10&rOn the seventh'
  '7': day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, &l11&rTo bring Vashti the queen before the king
  '8': 'with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she
    was fair to look on. &l12&rBut the queen Vashti refused to come at the king''s
    commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger
    burned in him.'
  '9': '&l13&rThen the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was
    the king''s manner toward all that knew law and judgment: &l14&rAnd the next unto
    him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the
    seven princes of'
  '10': Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;) &l15&rWhat shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains? &l16&rAnd Memucan
  '11': answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. &l17&rFor this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto
  '12': all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not. &l18&rLikewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day
  '13': unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath. &l19&rIf it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the
  '14': Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. &l20&rAnd when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire,
  '15': '(for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both
    to great and small. &l21&rAnd the saying pleased the king and the princes; and
    the king did according to the word of Memucan: &l22&rFor he sent letters into
    all the king''s'
  '16': provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.
  '17': 'Chapter 2

    After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered
    Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. &l2&rThen said
    the king''s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins
    sought'
  '18': 'for the king: &l3&rAnd let the king appoint officers in all the provinces
    of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto
    Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king''s
    chamberlain, keeper'
  '19': 'of the women; and let their things for purification be given them: &l4&rAnd
    let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing
    pleased the king; and he did so. &l5&rNow in Shushan the palace there was a certain
    Jew, whose name'
  '20': was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; &l6&rWho had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried
  '21': 'away. &l7&rAnd he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle''s daughter:
    for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom
    Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter. &l8&rSo
    it came to'
  '22': pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
  '23': '&l9&rAnd the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he
    speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to
    her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king''s house:
    and he preferred her'
  '24': 'and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women. &l10&rEsther
    had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she
    should not shew it. &l11&rAnd Mordecai walked every day before the court of the
    women''s house, to'
  '25': know how Esther did, and what should become of her. &l12&rNow when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications
  '26': accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;) &l13&rThen thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the
  '27': 'house of the women unto the king''s house. &l14&rIn the evening she went,
    and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody
    of Shaashgaz, the king''s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in
    unto the king no more,'
  '28': except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name. &l15&rNow when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai
  '29': the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her. &l16&rSo Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the
  '30': seventh year of his reign. &l17&rAnd the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. &l18&rThen the
  '31': king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king. &l19&rAnd when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai
  '32': 'sat in the king''s gate. &l20&rEsther had not yet shewed her kindred nor
    her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai,
    like as when she was brought up with him. &l21&rIn those days, while Mordecai
    sat in the king''s'
  '33': gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus. &l22&rAnd the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king
  '34': 'thereof in Mordecai''s name. &l23&rAnd when inquisition was made of the matter,
    it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written
    in the book of the chronicles before the king.'
  '35': 'Chapter 3

    After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the
    Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with
    him. &l2&rAnd all the king''s servants, that were in the king''s gate, bowed,
    and'
  '36': 'reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai
    bowed not, nor did him reverence. &l3&rThen the king''s servants, which were in
    the king''s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king''s commandment?
    &l4&rNow it came'
  '37': 'to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them,
    that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai''s matters would stand: for he had
    told them that he was a Jew. &l5&rAnd when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not,
    nor did him reverence,'
  '38': 'then was Haman full of wrath. &l6&rAnd he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai
    alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought
    to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even
    the people of'
  '39': Mordecai. &l7&rIn the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar. &l8&rAnd Haman said
  '40': 'unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed
    among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse
    from all people; neither keep they the king''s laws: therefore it is not for the
    king''s profit to'
  '41': 'suffer them. &l9&rIf it please the king, let it be written that they may
    be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those
    that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king''s treasuries.
    &l10&rAnd the king took'
  '42': his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy. &l11&rAnd the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee. &l12&rThen were the king's
  '43': scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province
  '44': according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring. &l13&rAnd the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to
  '45': cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey. &l14&rThe copy of the writing for a commandment to
  '46': be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day. &l15&rThe posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.
  '47': 'Chapter 4

    When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put
    on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with
    a loud and a bitter cry; &l2&rAnd came even before the king''s gate: for none
    might'
  '48': enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth. &l3&rAnd in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
  '49': '&l4&rSo Esther''s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was
    the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to
    take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not. &l5&rThen called Esther
    for Hatach, one of'
  '50': the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was. &l6&rSo Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.

  '1': 'Chapter 4 Cont.

    &l7&rAnd Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of
    the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king''s treasuries for the Jews,
    to destroy them. &l8&rAlso he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree'
  '2': that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people. &l9&rAnd Hatach came and
  '3': told Esther the words of Mordecai. &l10&rAgain Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai; &l11&rAll the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the king
  '4': 'into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him
    to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that
    he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty
    days. &l12&rAnd they'
  '5': told to Mordecai Esther's words. &l13&rThen Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews. &l14&rFor if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there
  '6': 'enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou
    and thy father''s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come
    to the kingdom for such a time as this? &l15&rThen Esther bade them return Mordecai
    this answer,'
  '7': '&l16&rGo, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast
    ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens
    will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according
    to the law: and'
  '8': if I perish, I perish. &l17&rSo Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
  '9': 'Chapter 5

    Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and
    stood in the inner court of the king''s house, over against the king''s house:
    and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate
    of the'
  '10': 'house. &l2&rAnd it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in
    the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther
    the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the
    top of the sceptre.'
  '11': '&l3&rThen said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what
    is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom. &l4&rAnd
    Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this
    day unto the banquet'
  '12': that I have prepared for him. &l5&rThen the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. &l6&rAnd the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy
  '13': 'petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to
    the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. &l7&rThen answered Esther, and
    said, My petition and my request is; &l8&rIf I have found favour in the sight
    of the king, and if it'
  '14': 'please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the
    king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do
    to morrow as the king hath said. &l9&rThen went Haman forth that day joyful and
    with a glad heart: but'
  '15': 'when Haman saw Mordecai in the king''s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved
    for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai. &l10&rNevertheless Haman
    refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends,
    and Zeresh his wife.'
  '16': '&l11&rAnd Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of
    his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he
    had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. &l12&rHaman said
    moreover, Yea, Esther'
  '17': the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king. &l13&rYet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
  '18': '&l14&rThen said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows
    be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai
    may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet.
    And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.'
  '19': 'Chapter 6

    On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of
    records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. &l2&rAnd it was
    found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king''s'
  '20': chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. &l3&rAnd the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.
  '21': ' &l4&rAnd the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the
    outward court of the king''s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on
    the gallows that he had prepared for him. &l5&rAnd the king''s servants said unto
    him, Behold, Haman'
  '22': standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. &l6&rSo Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour
  '23': more than to myself? &l7&rAnd Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, &l8&rLet the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his
  '24': 'head: &l9&rAnd let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one
    of the king''s most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the
    king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the
    city, and proclaim'
  '25': 'before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to
    honour. &l10&rThen the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and
    the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth
    at the king''s gate: let'
  '26': nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. &l11&rThen took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king
  '27': delighteth to honour. &l12&rAnd Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered. &l13&rAnd Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men
  '28': and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him. &l14&rAnd while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains,
  '29': and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.
  '30': 'Chapter 7

    So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. &l2&rAnd the king
    said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition,
    queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it'
  '31': 'shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom. &l3&rThen Esther the
    queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it
    please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:
    &l4&rFor we are'
  '32': sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king''s damage.' &l5&rThen the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto
  '33': Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so? &l6&rAnd Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. &l7&rAnd the king arising from the banquet of
  '34': 'wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make
    request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined
    against him by the king. &l8&rThen the king returned out of the palace garden
    into the place of'
  '35': the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. &l9&rAnd Harbonah, one of the chamberlains,
  '36': said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon. &l10&rSo they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had
  '37': prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.
  '38': 'Chapter 8

    On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews'' enemy unto
    Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what
    he was unto her. &l2&rAnd the king took off his ring, which he had taken from
    Haman, and'
  '39': gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. &l3&rAnd Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had
  '40': devised against the Jews. &l4&rThen the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king, &l5&rAnd said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be
  '41': 'pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by
    Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which
    are in all the king''s provinces: &l6&rFor how can I endure to see the evil that
    shall come unto my'
  '42': people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? &l7&rThen the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid
  '43': 'his hand upon the Jews. &l8&rWrite ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you,
    in the king''s name, and seal it with the king''s ring: for the writing which
    is written in the king''s name, and sealed with the king''s ring, may no man reverse.
    &l9&rThen were the'
  '44': king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the
  '45': provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their
  '46': 'language. &l10&rAnd he wrote in the king Ahasuerus'' name, and sealed it
    with the king''s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules,
    camels, and young dromedaries: &l11&rWherein the king granted the Jews which were
    in every city to'
  '47': gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, &l12&rUpon one day
  '48': in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. &l13&rThe copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be
  '49': ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. &l14&rSo the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace. &l15&rAnd Mordecai went out
  '50': 'from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with
    a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city
    of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. &l16&rThe Jews had light, and gladness, and
    joy, and honour.'

    &l2&rThe Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the
    provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and
    no man could'
  '4': withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people. &l3&rAnd all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them. &l4&rFor Mordecai was great
  '5': 'in the king''s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces:
    for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater. &l5&rThus the Jews smote all
    their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and
    did what they would unto'
  '6': those that hated them. &l6&rAnd in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. &l7&rAnd Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, &l8&rAnd Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, &l9&rAnd Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
  '7': '&l10&rThe ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews,
    slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand. &l11&rOn that day the number
    of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king. &l12&rAnd
    the king said'
  '8': 'unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men
    in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest
    of the king''s provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee:
    or what is thy'
  '9': request further? and it shall be done. &l13&rThen said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows. &l14&rAnd
  '10': 'the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan;
    and they hanged Haman''s ten sons. &l15&rFor the Jews that were in Shushan gathered
    themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three
    hundred men at'
  '11': Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand. &l16&rBut the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but
  '12': they laid not their hands on the prey, &l17&rOn the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. &l18&rBut the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
  '13': thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. &l19&rTherefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the
  '14': month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another. &l20&rAnd Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, &l21&rTo
  '15': stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, &l22&rAs the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and
  '16': 'from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting
    and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor. &l23&rAnd
    the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;
    &l24&rBecause'
  '17': Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them; &l25&rBut when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters
  '18': that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. &l26&rWherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this
  '19': letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them, &l27&rThe Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep
  '20': these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year; &l28&rAnd that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim
  '21': should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed. &l29&rThen Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim. &l30&rAnd he sent the
  '22': letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, &l31&rTo confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined
  '23': them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry. &l32&rAnd the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
  '24': 'Chapter 10

    And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the
    sea. &l2&rAnd all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration
    of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written
    in'
  '25': the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? &l3&rFor Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his
  '26': seed.
