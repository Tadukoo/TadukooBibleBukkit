ch1v9: 'And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:'
ch1v10: Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.
ch1v11: Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.

ch1v21: And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
ch1v22: And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

ch5v5: And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
ch5v6: And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
ch5v7: 'Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.'

ch9v5: And the Lord appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land.
ch9v6: 'And the Lord did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.'

ch9v14: For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.
ch9v15: For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
ch9v16: And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.

ch9v18: Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.
ch9v19: Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

ch9v29: And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the Lord's.

ch14v24: And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,
ch14v25: 'And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.'

ch16v3: And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
ch16v4: Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.

ch16v8: 'And Moses said, This shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.'
ch16v9: 'And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the Lord: for he hath heard your murmurings.'
ch16v10: And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.
ch16v11: And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
ch16v12: 'I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.'

ch16v24: 'And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.'
ch16v25: 'And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the Lord: to day ye shall not find it in the field.'
ch16v26: Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
ch16v27: And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.
ch16v28: And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?

ch16v30: So the people rested on the seventh day.
ch16v31: 'And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.'
