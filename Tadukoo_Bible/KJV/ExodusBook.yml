  '1': Chapter 1/nNow these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. &l2&rReuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, &l3&rIssachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, &l4&rDan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. &l5&rAnd
  '2': 'all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for
    Joseph was in Egypt already. &l6&rAnd Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all
    that generation. &l7&rAnd the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased
    abundantly, and'
  '3': 'multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
    &l8&rNow there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. &l9&rAnd
    he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more
    and mightier than we:'
  '4': '&l10&rCome on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come
    to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies,
    and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. &l11&rTherefore they
    did set over them'
  '5': taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. &l12&rBut the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. &l13&rAnd
  '6': 'the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: &l14&rAnd
    they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in
    all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them
    serve, was with rigour.'
  '7': '&l15&rAnd the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name
    of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: &l16&rAnd he said, When
    ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools;
    if it be a son,'
  '8': 'then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. &l17&rBut
    the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but
    saved the men children alive. &l18&rAnd the king of Egypt called for the midwives,
    and said unto'
  '9': them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? &l19&rAnd the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.
  '10': '&l20&rTherefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied,
    and waxed very mighty. &l21&rAnd it came to pass, because the midwives feared
    God, that he made them houses. &l22&rAnd Pharaoh charged all his people, saying,
    Every son that is'
  '11': born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
  '12': 'Chapter 2/nAnd there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
    daughter of Levi. &l2&rAnd the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw
    him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. &l3&rAnd when she could
    not longer hide him,'
  '13': she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink. &l4&rAnd his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. &l5&rAnd the daughter of
  '14': 'Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along
    by the river''s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid
    to fetch it. &l6&rAnd when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold,
    the babe wept. And'
  '15': she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. &l7&rThen said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? &l8&rAnd Pharaoh's daughter said to
  '16': her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. &l9&rAnd Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it. &l10&rAnd the child grew, and she
  '17': 'brought him unto Pharaoh''s daughter, and he became her son. And she called
    his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. &l11&rAnd it
    came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren,
    and looked on'
  '18': 'their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
    &l12&rAnd he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man,
    he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. &l13&rAnd when he went out the
    second day,'
  '19': 'behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did
    the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? &l14&rAnd he said, Who made thee
    a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the
    Egyptian? And Moses'
  '20': 'feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. &l15&rNow when Pharaoh heard
    this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh,
    and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. &l16&rNow the priest
    of Midian had seven'
  '21': 'daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water
    their father''s flock. &l17&rAnd the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses
    stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. &l18&rAnd when they came to
    Reuel their father, he'
  '22': said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? &l19&rAnd they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. &l20&rAnd he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that
  '23': 'ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. &l21&rAnd Moses was
    content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. &l22&rAnd
    she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a
    stranger in a'
  '24': 'strange land. &l23&rAnd it came to pass in process of time, that the king
    of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and
    they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. &l24&rAnd
    God heard their'
  '25': groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. &l25&rAnd God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.
  '26': 'Chapter 3/nNow Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest
    of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the
    mountain of God, even to Horeb. &l2&rAnd the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
    in a flame of fire'
  '27': 'out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with
    fire, and the bush was not consumed. &l3&rAnd Moses said, I will now turn aside,
    and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. &l4&rAnd when the Lord saw
    that he turned'
  '28': 'aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,
    Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. &l5&rAnd he said, Draw not nigh hither:
    put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy
    ground. &l6&rMoreover'
  '29': he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. &l7&rAnd the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have
  '30': heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; &l8&rAnd I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey;
  '31': 'unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and
    the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. &l9&rNow therefore, behold,
    the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression
    wherewith the'
  '32': Egyptians oppress them. &l10&rCome now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. &l11&rAnd Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring
  '33': 'forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? &l12&rAnd he said, Certainly I
    will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee:
    When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon
    this mountain. &l13&rAnd'
  '34': Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? &l14&rAnd God said unto Moses, I Am That I
  '35': 'Am: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath
    sent me unto you. &l15&rAnd God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say
    unto the children of Israel, the Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
    the God of Isaac, and'
  '36': 'the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this
    is my memorial unto all generations. &l16&rGo, and gather the elders of Israel
    together, and say unto them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
    of Isaac, and of'
  '37': 'Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that
    which is done to you in Egypt: &l17&rAnd I have said, I will bring you up out
    of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites,
    and the Amorites, and the'
  '38': 'Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with
    milk and honey. &l18&rAnd they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come,
    thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him,
    The Lord God of the'
  '39': 'Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days''
    journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God. &l19&rAnd
    I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.
    &l20&rAnd I will'
  '40': 'stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do
    in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. &l21&rAnd I will give
    this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that,
    when ye go, ye shall'
  '41': 'not go empty. &l22&rBut every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of
    her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:
    and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil
    the Egyptians.'
  '42': 'Chapter 4/nAnd Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe
    me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto
    thee. &l2&rAnd the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said,
    A rod. &l3&rAnd he'
  '43': said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. &l4&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a
  '44': 'rod in his hand: &l5&rThat they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers,
    the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto
    thee. &l6&rAnd the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy
    bosom. And he put'
  '45': 'his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous
    as snow. &l7&rAnd he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his
    hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was
    turned again as'
  '46': his other flesh. &l8&rAnd it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. &l9&rAnd it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two
  '47': 'signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water
    of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out
    of the river shall become blood upon the dry land. &l10&rAnd Moses said unto the
    Lord, O my Lord, I am'
  '48': 'not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant:
    but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. &l11&rAnd the Lord said unto him,
    Who hath made man''s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or
    the blind? have'
  '49': not I the Lord? &l12&rNow therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. &l13&rAnd he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. &l14&rAnd the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses,
  '50': 'and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak
    well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee,
    he will be glad in his heart.'

  '1': 'Chapter 4 Cont./n&l15&rAnd thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his
    mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what
    ye shall do. &l16&rAnd he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall
    be, even he shall be'
  '2': to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. &l17&rAnd thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs. &l18&rAnd Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee,
  '3': 'and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet
    alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. &l19&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses
    in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.
    &l20&rAnd Moses'
  '4': 'took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the
    land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. &l21&rAnd the Lord said
    unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders
    before'
  '5': 'Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that
    he shall not let the people go. &l22&rAnd thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith
    the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn: &l23&rAnd I say unto thee, Let
    my son go, that he'
  '6': 'may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,
    even thy firstborn. &l24&rAnd it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the
    Lord met him, and sought to kill him. &l25&rThen Zipporah took a sharp stone,
    and cut off the'
  '7': 'foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband
    art thou to me. &l26&rSo he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,
    because of the circumcision. &l27&rAnd the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness
    to meet'
  '8': Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. &l28&rAnd Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. &l29&rAnd Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of
  '9': 'the children of Israel: &l30&rAnd Aaron spake all the words which the Lord
    had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. &l31&rAnd
    the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children
    of Israel, and that he'
  '10': had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.
  '11': Chapter 5/nAnd afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. &l2&rAnd Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to let
  '12': 'Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go. &l3&rAnd they
    said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three
    days'' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God; lest he fall
    upon us with'
  '13': pestilence, or with the sword. &l4&rAnd the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. &l5&rAnd Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them
  '14': 'rest from their burdens. &l6&rAnd Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters
    of the people, and their officers, saying, &l7&rYe shall no more give the people
    straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
    &l8&rAnd the'
  '15': 'tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them;
    ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying,
    Let us go and sacrifice to our God. &l9&rLet there more work be laid upon the
    men, that they may'
  '16': 'labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. &l10&rAnd the taskmasters
    of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying,
    Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. &l11&rGo ye, get you straw where
    ye can find it:'
  '17': yet not ought of your work shall be diminished. &l12&rSo the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. &l13&rAnd the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there
  '18': was straw. &l14&rAnd the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? &l15&rThen the
  '19': 'officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore
    dealest thou thus with thy servants? &l16&rThere is no straw given unto thy servants,
    and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the
    fault is'
  '20': 'in thine own people. &l17&rBut he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore
    ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the Lord. &l18&rGo therefore now, and work;
    for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.
    &l19&rAnd the'
  '21': 'officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after
    it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task. &l20&rAnd
    they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
    &l21&rAnd'
  '22': they said unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. &l22&rAnd Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord,
  '23': wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? &l23&rFor since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
  '24': 'Chapter 6/nThen the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will
    do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong
    hand shall he drive them out of his land. &l2&rAnd God spake unto Moses, and said
    unto him, I am the'
  '25': 'Lord: &l3&rAnd I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the
    name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them. &l4&rAnd
    I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan,
    the land of their'
  '26': pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. &l5&rAnd I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. &l6&rWherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will
  '27': 'bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you
    out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with
    great judgments: &l7&rAnd I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to
    you a God: and ye shall'
  '28': know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. &l8&rAnd I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an
  '29': 'heritage: I am the Lord. &l9&rAnd Moses spake so unto the children of Israel:
    but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
    &l10&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l11&rGo in, speak unto Pharaoh king
    of Egypt, that'
  '30': he let the children of Israel go out of his land. &l12&rAnd Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? &l13&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses
  '31': 'and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto
    Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
    &l14&rThese be the heads of their fathers'' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn
    of Israel;'
  '32': 'Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben. &l15&rAnd
    the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul
    the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon. &l16&rAnd these
    are the'
  '33': 'names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath,
    and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven
    years. &l17&rThe sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.
    &l18&rAnd the'
  '34': 'sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of
    the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years. &l19&rAnd the sons
    of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their
    generations. &l20&rAnd'
  '35': 'Amram took him Jochebed his father''s sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron
    and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven
    years. &l21&rAnd the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. &l22&rAnd the
    sons of Uzziel;'
  '36': 'Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. &l23&rAnd Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter
    of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar,
    and Ithamar. &l24&rAnd the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these
    are the'
  '37': 'families of the Korhites. &l25&rAnd Eleazar Aaron''s son took him one of
    the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads
    of the fathers of the Levites according to their families. &l26&rThese are that
    Aaron and Moses, to whom'
  '38': 'the Lord said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according
    to their armies. &l27&rThese are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to
    bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron. &l28&rAnd
    it came'
  '39': 'to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, &l29&rThat
    the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord: speak thou unto Pharaoh king
    of Egypt all that I say unto thee. &l30&rAnd Moses said before the Lord, Behold,
    I am of'
  '40': uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
  '41': 'Chapter 7/nAnd the Lord said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh:
    and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. &l2&rThou shalt speak all that I command
    thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children
    of Israel'
  '42': out of his land. &l3&rAnd I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. &l4&rBut Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of
  '43': Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. &l5&rAnd the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. &l6&rAnd Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded
  '44': them, so did they. &l7&rAnd Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. &l8&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, &l9&rWhen Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for
  '45': 'you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh,
    and it shall become a serpent. &l10&rAnd Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh,
    and they did so as the Lord had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before
    Pharaoh, and before'
  '46': 'his servants, and it became a serpent. &l11&rThen Pharaoh also called the
    wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like
    manner with their enchantments. &l12&rFor they cast down every man his rod, and
    they became serpents:'
  '47': but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. &l13&rAnd he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said. &l14&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. &l15&rGet thee unto
  '48': Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. &l16&rAnd thou shalt say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath
  '49': 'sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the
    wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. &l17&rThus saith the
    Lord, In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord: behold, I will smite with the
    rod that is in mine'
  '50': hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. &l18&rAnd the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.

  '1': Chapter 7 Cont./n&l19&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become
  '2': blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. &l20&rAnd Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the
  '3': sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. &l21&rAnd the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there
  '4': 'was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. &l22&rAnd the magicians of Egypt
    did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh''s heart was hardened, neither did
    he hearken unto them; as the Lord had said. &l23&rAnd Pharaoh turned and went
    into his house, neither'
  '5': did he set his heart to this also. &l24&rAnd all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. &l25&rAnd seven days were fulfilled, after that the Lord had smitten the river.
  '6': 'Chapter 8/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,
    Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me. &l2&rAnd if thou
    refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: &l3&rAnd
    the river shall'
  '7': 'bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house,
    and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants,
    and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: &l4&rAnd
    the frogs shall come'
  '8': up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. &l5&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of
  '9': Egypt. &l6&rAnd Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. &l7&rAnd the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. &l8&rThen Pharaoh called for
  '10': 'Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the Lord, that he may take away the frogs
    from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice
    unto the Lord. &l9&rAnd Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat
    for'
  '11': 'thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from
    thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only? &l10&rAnd he said,
    To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that
    there is none like'
  '12': 'unto the Lord our God. &l11&rAnd the frogs shall depart from thee, and from
    thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the
    river only. &l12&rAnd Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto
    the Lord because'
  '13': 'of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. &l13&rAnd the Lord did
    according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the
    villages, and out of the fields. &l14&rAnd they gathered them together upon heaps:
    and the land'
  '14': stank. &l15&rBut when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said. &l16&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become
  '15': lice throughout all the land of Egypt. &l17&rAnd they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
  '16': '&l18&rAnd the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice,
    but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. &l19&rThen the
    magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh''s heart was
    hardened, and he'
  '17': hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said. &l20&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
  '18': '&l21&rElse, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms
    of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses:
    and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the
    ground whereon'
  '19': they are. &l22&rAnd I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth. &l23&rAnd I will put a division between my people
  '20': 'and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be. &l24&rAnd the Lord did so;
    and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his
    servants'' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason
    of the swarm of'
  '21': 'flies. &l25&rAnd Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
    sacrifice to your God in the land. &l26&rAnd Moses said, It is not meet so to
    do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God:
    lo, shall we sacrifice'
  '22': the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? &l27&rWe will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he shall command us. &l28&rAnd Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may
  '23': 'sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very
    far away: intreat for me. &l29&rAnd Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and
    I will intreat the Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from
    his servants, and'
  '24': 'from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more
    in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord. &l30&rAnd Moses went out
    from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord. &l31&rAnd the Lord did according to the
    word of Moses; and he'
  '25': removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. &l32&rAnd Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.
  '26': Chapter 9/nThen the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. &l2&rFor if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, &l3&rBehold, the hand of the
  '27': 'Lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the
    asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very
    grievous murrain. &l4&rAnd the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and
    the cattle of Egypt:'
  '28': 'and there shall nothing die of all that is the children''s of Israel. &l5&rAnd
    the Lord appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the Lord shall do this thing
    in the land. &l6&rAnd the Lord did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle
    of Egypt died: but'
  '29': of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. &l7&rAnd Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. &l8&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses and
  '30': unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. &l9&rAnd it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon
  '31': beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. &l10&rAnd they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. &l11&rAnd the magicians could
  '32': not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. &l12&rAnd the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses. &l13&rAnd the Lord said unto
  '33': Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. &l14&rFor I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants,
  '34': and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. &l15&rFor now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. &l16&rAnd in very deed for
  '35': this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. &l17&rAs yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? &l18&rBehold, to morrow about this time I will
  '36': cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now. &l19&rSend therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in
  '37': 'the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them,
    and they shall die. &l20&rHe that feared the word of the Lord among the servants
    of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: &l21&rAnd he
    that regarded not'
  '38': the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field. &l22&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field,
  '39': 'throughout the land of Egypt. &l23&rAnd Moses stretched forth his rod toward
    heaven: and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground;
    and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt. &l24&rSo there was hail, and
    fire mingled with'
  '40': the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. &l25&rAnd the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field,
  '41': 'and brake every tree of the field. &l26&rOnly in the land of Goshen, where
    the children of Israel were, was there no hail. &l27&rAnd Pharaoh sent, and called
    for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the Lord is
    righteous, and I and'
  '42': my people are wicked. &l28&rIntreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. &l29&rAnd Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad
  '43': my hands unto the Lord; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the Lord's. &l30&rBut as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God. &l31&rAnd the flax and
  '44': 'the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.
    &l32&rBut the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.
    &l33&rAnd Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands
    unto the Lord: and'
  '45': the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. &l34&rAnd when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. &l35&rAnd the heart of Pharaoh
  '46': was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the Lord had spoken by Moses.
  '47': 'Chapter 10/nAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have
    hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my
    signs before him: &l2&rAnd that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of
    thy son''s son, what'
  '48': things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the Lord. &l3&rAnd Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to
  '49': 'humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. &l4&rElse,
    if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts
    into thy coast: &l5&rAnd they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot
    be able to see'
  '50': 'the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which
    remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you
    out of the field:'

  '1': Chapter 10 Cont./n&l6&rAnd they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he
  '2': 'turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. &l7&rAnd Pharaoh''s servants said
    unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they
    may serve the Lord their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? &l8&rAnd
    Moses and Aaron'
  '3': 'were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the Lord
    your God: but who are they that shall go? &l9&rAnd Moses said, We will go with
    our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks
    and with our herds'
  '4': 'will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the Lord. &l10&rAnd he said unto
    them, Let the Lord be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones:
    look to it; for evil is before you. &l11&rNot so: go now ye that are men, and
    serve the Lord; for that'
  '5': ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. &l12&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that
  '6': the hail hath left. &l13&rAnd Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. &l14&rAnd the locust went up
  '7': 'over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous
    were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them
    shall be such. &l15&rFor they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the
    land was darkened;'
  '8': 'and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which
    the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in
    the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. &l16&rThen Pharaoh called
    for Moses and Aaron'
  '9': in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you. &l17&rNow therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death only. &l18&rAnd he went out from
  '10': Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord. &l19&rAnd the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. &l20&rBut the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so
  '11': that he would not let the children of Israel go. &l21&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt. &l22&rAnd Moses stretched forth his hand toward
  '12': 'heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:
    &l23&rThey saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days:
    but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. &l24&rAnd Pharaoh
    called unto Moses,'
  '13': 'and said, Go ye, serve the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed:
    let your little ones also go with you. &l25&rAnd Moses said, Thou must give us
    also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God.
    &l26&rOur'
  '14': cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we know not with what we must serve the Lord, until we come thither. &l27&rBut the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not
  '15': let them go. &l28&rAnd Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. &l29&rAnd Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.
  '16': 'Chapter 11/nAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more
    upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall
    let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. &l2&rSpeak now in
    the ears of the'
  '17': people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold. &l3&rAnd the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in
  '18': 'the sight of Pharaoh''s servants, and in the sight of the people. &l4&rAnd
    Moses said, Thus saith the Lord, About midnight will I go out into the midst of
    Egypt: &l5&rAnd all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first
    born of Pharaoh that'
  '19': sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts. &l6&rAnd there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any
  '20': 'more. &l7&rBut against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
    his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth put
    a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. &l8&rAnd all these thy servants
    shall come down unto me,'
  '21': 'and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people
    that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in
    a great anger. &l9&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto
    you; that my wonders'
  '22': 'may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. &l10&rAnd Moses and Aaron did all
    these wonders before Pharaoh: and the Lord hardened Pharaoh''s heart, so that
    he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.'
  '23': 'Chapter 12/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
    saying, &l2&rThis month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be
    the first month of the year to you. &l3&rSpeak ye unto all the congregation of
    Israel, saying, In the'
  '24': 'tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according
    to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: &l4&rAnd if the household
    be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take
    it according to the'
  '25': 'number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count
    for the lamb. &l5&rYour lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year:
    ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: &l6&rAnd ye shall keep
    it up until the'
  '26': 'fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation
    of Israel shall kill it in the evening. &l7&rAnd they shall take of the blood,
    and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses,
    wherein they shall eat'
  '27': it. &l8&rAnd they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. &l9&rEat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance
  '28': thereof. &l10&rAnd ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. &l11&rAnd thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand;
  '29': 'and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord''s passover. &l12&rFor I will
    pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in
    the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will
    execute judgment: I am'
  '30': 'the Lord. &l13&rAnd the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses
    where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall
    not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. &l14&rAnd this
    day shall be unto'
  '31': 'you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your
    generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. &l15&rSeven days
    shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out
    of your houses: for'
  '32': whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. &l16&rAnd in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of
  '33': 'work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only
    may be done of you. &l17&rAnd ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread;
    for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:
    therefore shall ye observe'
  '34': this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. &l18&rIn the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. &l19&rSeven days shall there be no leaven
  '35': 'found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that
    soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger,
    or born in the land. &l20&rYe shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations
    shall ye eat'
  '36': unleavened bread. &l21&rThen Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. &l22&rAnd ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the
  '37': bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. &l23&rFor the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon
  '38': the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. &l24&rAnd ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. &l25&rAnd it shall
  '39': come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. &l26&rAnd it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? &l27&rThat ye
  '40': shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. &l28&rAnd the children of Israel went
  '41': away, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. &l29&rAnd it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive
  '42': that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. &l30&rAnd Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. &l31&rAnd he
  '43': called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the Lord, as ye have said. &l32&rAlso take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless
  '44': me also. &l33&rAnd the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. &l34&rAnd the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their
  '45': 'clothes upon their shoulders. &l35&rAnd the children of Israel did according
    to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and
    jewels of gold, and raiment: &l36&rAnd the Lord gave the people favour in the
    sight of the'
  '46': Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. &l37&rAnd the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. &l38&rAnd a mixed
  '47': multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. &l39&rAnd they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry,
  '48': neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. &l40&rNow the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. &l41&rAnd it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame
  '49': 'day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land
    of Egypt. &l42&rIt is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them
    out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all
    the children of'
  '50': 'Israel in their generations. &l43&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron,
    This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:'

  '1': Chapter 12 Cont./n&l44&rBut every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. &l45&rA foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. &l46&rIn one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry
  '2': forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. &l47&rAll the congregation of Israel shall keep it. &l48&rAnd when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the Lord, let all his males be
  '3': 'circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one
    that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. &l49&rOne
    law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among
    you. &l50&rThus'
  '4': did all the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. &l51&rAnd it came to pass the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
  '5': 'Chapter 13/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rSanctify unto me all
    the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both
    of man and of beast: it is mine. &l3&rAnd Moses said unto the people, Remember
    this day, in which ye'
  '6': 'came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand
    the Lord brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
    &l4&rThis day came ye out in the month Abib. &l5&rAnd it shall be when the Lord
    shall bring thee'
  '7': into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. &l6&rSeven days thou
  '8': shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord. &l7&rUnleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.
  '9': '&l8&rAnd thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because
    of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. &l9&rAnd it
    shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine
    eyes, that the Lord''s'
  '10': 'law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee
    out of Egypt. &l10&rThou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from
    year to year. &l11&rAnd it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land
    of the Canaanites,'
  '11': as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, &l12&rThat thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the Lord's. &l13&rAnd every
  '12': 'firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem
    it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children
    shalt thou redeem. &l14&rAnd it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
    saying,'
  '13': 'What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the Lord
    brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: &l15&rAnd it came to pass,
    when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the Lord slew all the firstborn in the
    land of Egypt, both'
  '14': 'the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to
    the Lord all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my
    children I redeem. &l16&rAnd it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for
    frontlets between thine'
  '15': 'eyes: for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt. &l17&rAnd
    it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through
    the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said,
    Lest'
  '16': 'peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:
    &l18&rBut God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red
    sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt. &l19&rAnd
    Moses took'
  '17': 'the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel,
    saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with
    you. &l20&rAnd they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in
    the edge of the'
  '18': 'wilderness. &l21&rAnd the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud,
    to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to
    go by day and night: &l22&rHe took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor
    the pillar of fire'
  '19': by night, from before the people.
  '20': 'Chapter 14/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rSpeak unto the children
    of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the
    sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. &l3&rFor Pharaoh
    will say of'
  '21': the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. &l4&rAnd I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that
  '22': 'I am the Lord. And they did so. &l5&rAnd it was told the king of Egypt that
    the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against
    the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from
    serving us?'
  '23': '&l6&rAnd he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: &l7&rAnd
    he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains
    over every one of them. &l8&rAnd the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of
    Egypt, and he'
  '24': 'pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out
    with an high hand. &l9&rBut the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and
    chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping
    by the sea, beside'
  '25': 'Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon. &l10&rAnd when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children
    of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them;
    and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.
    &l11&rAnd they said'
  '26': unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? &l12&rIs not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone,
  '27': that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. &l13&rAnd Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you
  '28': 'to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again
    no more for ever. &l14&rThe Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
    &l15&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto
    the children of'
  '29': 'Israel, that they go forward: &l16&rBut lift thou up thy rod, and stretch
    out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go
    on dry ground through the midst of the sea. &l17&rAnd I, behold, I will harden
    the hearts of the'
  '30': 'Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh,
    and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. &l18&rAnd the
    Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh,
    upon his'
  '31': 'chariots, and upon his horsemen. &l19&rAnd the angel of God, which went before
    the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud
    went from before their face, and stood behind them: &l20&rAnd it came between
    the camp of the'
  '32': 'Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them,
    but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all
    the night. &l21&rAnd Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused
    the sea to go'
  '33': 'back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and
    the waters were divided. &l22&rAnd the children of Israel went into the midst
    of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their
    right hand, and on their'
  '34': left. &l23&rAnd the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. &l24&rAnd it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through
  '35': 'the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,
    &l25&rAnd took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that
    the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the Lord fighteth
    for them against the'
  '36': Egyptians. &l26&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. &l27&rAnd Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned
  '37': to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. &l28&rAnd the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came
  '38': into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. &l29&rBut the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. &l30&rThus the Lord saved Israel
  '39': 'that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead
    upon the sea shore. &l31&rAnd Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon
    the Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and his
    servant Moses.'
  '40': 'Chapter 15/nThen sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
    Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously:
    the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. &l2&rThe Lord is my strength
    and song, and'
  '41': 'he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation;
    my father''s God, and I will exalt him. &l3&rThe Lord is a man of war: the Lord
    is his name. &l4&rPharaoh''s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea:
    his chosen captains'
  '42': 'also are drowned in the Red sea. &l5&rThe depths have covered them: they
    sank into the bottom as a stone. &l6&rThy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious
    in power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. &l7&rAnd in
    the greatness of thine'
  '43': 'excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest
    forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble. &l8&rAnd with the blast of thy
    nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap,
    and the depths'
  '44': were congealed in the heart of the sea. &l9&rThe enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. &l10&rThou didst blow with thy wind, the sea
  '45': 'covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. &l11&rWho is like unto
    thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful
    in praises, doing wonders? &l12&rThou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth
    swallowed them.'
  '46': '&l13&rThou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed:
    thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. &l14&rThe people
    shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.
    &l15&rThen the'
  '47': dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. &l16&rFear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy
  '48': people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. &l17&rThou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord,
  '49': which thy hands have established. &l18&rThe Lord shall reign for ever and ever. &l19&rFor the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of
  '50': Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. &l20&rAnd Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.

  '1': Chapter 15 Cont./n&l21&rAnd Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. &l22&rSo Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and
  '2': 'they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. &l23&rAnd when
    they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were
    bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. &l24&rAnd the people murmured
    against Moses,'
  '3': 'saying, What shall we drink? &l25&rAnd he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord
    shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made
    sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved
    them, &l26&rAnd said,'
  '4': If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the
  '5': 'Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee. &l27&rAnd they came to Elim,
    where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they
    encamped there by the waters.'
  '6': Chapter 16/nAnd they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
  '7': '&l2&rAnd the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against
    Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: &l3&rAnd the children of Israel said unto them,
    Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we
    sat by the flesh'
  '8': pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. &l4&rThen said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and
  '9': gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. &l5&rAnd it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. &l6&rAnd
  '10': 'Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall
    know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: &l7&rAnd in the
    morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord; for that he heareth your murmurings
    against the'
  '11': 'Lord: and what are we, that ye murmur against us? &l8&rAnd Moses said, This
    shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the
    morning bread to the full; for that the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye
    murmur against him: and'
  '12': 'what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord. &l9&rAnd
    Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel,
    Come near before the Lord: for he hath heard your murmurings. &l10&rAnd it came
    to pass, as'
  '13': Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud. &l11&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l12&rI have heard the murmurings of the
  '14': 'children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh,
    and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am
    the Lord your God. &l13&rAnd it came to pass, that at even the quails came up,
    and covered the camp: and'
  '15': in the morning the dew lay round about the host. &l14&rAnd when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. &l15&rAnd when the children of Israel saw it,
  '16': 'they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And
    Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.
    &l16&rThis is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every man
    according to his eating,'
  '17': an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. &l17&rAnd the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. &l18&rAnd when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered
  '18': much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. &l19&rAnd Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. &l20&rNotwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it
  '19': 'until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with
    them. &l21&rAnd they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating:
    and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. &l22&rAnd it came to pass, that on the
    sixth day they'
  '20': 'gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of
    the congregation came and told Moses. &l23&rAnd he said unto them, This is that
    which the Lord hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord:
    bake that which ye'
  '21': 'will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth
    over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. &l24&rAnd they laid it up till
    the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.
    &l25&rAnd'
  '22': 'Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the Lord: to day
    ye shall not find it in the field. &l26&rSix days ye shall gather it; but on the
    seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. &l27&rAnd it came
    to pass, that there'
  '23': went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. &l28&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? &l29&rSee, for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you
  '24': 'on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place,
    let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. &l30&rSo the people rested
    on the seventh day. &l31&rAnd the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna:
    and it was like'
  '25': coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. &l32&rAnd Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the
  '26': wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. &l33&rAnd Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations. &l34&rAs the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron
  '27': laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. &l35&rAnd the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. &l36&rNow an omer is the tenth part of
  '28': an ephah.
  '29': 'Chapter 17/nAnd all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed
    from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment
    of the Lord, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to
    drink. &l2&rWherefore the'
  '30': people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the Lord? &l3&rAnd the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore
  '31': is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? &l4&rAnd Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. &l5&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Go
  '32': on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. &l6&rBehold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall
  '33': come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. &l7&rAnd he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord,
  '34': 'saying, Is the Lord among us, or not? &l8&rThen came Amalek, and fought with
    Israel in Rephidim. &l9&rAnd Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go
    out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the
    rod of God in mine'
  '35': 'hand. &l10&rSo Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:
    and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. &l11&rAnd it came to
    pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down
    his hand, Amalek'
  '36': prevailed. &l12&rBut Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of
  '37': 'the sun. &l13&rAnd Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge
    of the sword. &l14&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in
    a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the
    remembrance of Amalek'
  '38': 'from under heaven. &l15&rAnd Moses built an altar, and called the name of
    it Jehovahnissi: &l16&rFor he said, Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord
    will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.'
  '39': Chapter 18/nWhen Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt; &l2&rThen Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife,
  '40': 'after he had sent her back, &l3&rAnd her two sons; of which the name of the
    one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: &l4&rAnd
    the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine
    help, and delivered me'
  '41': 'from the sword of Pharaoh: &l5&rAnd Jethro, Moses'' father in law, came with
    his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the
    mount of God: &l6&rAnd he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come
    unto thee, and thy'
  '42': wife, and her two sons with her. &l7&rAnd Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. &l8&rAnd Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done
  '43': unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord delivered them. &l9&rAnd Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the
  '44': hand of the Egyptians. &l10&rAnd Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. &l11&rNow I know that the Lord
  '45': 'is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he
    was above them. &l12&rAnd Jethro, Moses'' father in law, took a burnt offering
    and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread
    with Moses'' father in'
  '46': 'law before God. &l13&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to
    judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.
    &l14&rAnd when Moses'' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said,
    What is this thing'
  '47': 'that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the
    people stand by thee from morning unto even? &l15&rAnd Moses said unto his father
    in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: &l16&rWhen they have
    a matter, they come'
  '48': unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. &l17&rAnd Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good. &l18&rThou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that
  '49': 'is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to
    perform it thyself alone. &l19&rHearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel,
    and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest
    bring the causes'
  '50': 'unto God: &l20&rAnd thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt
    shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.'

  '1': 'Chapter 18 Cont./n&l21&rMoreover thou shalt provide out of all the people
    able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such
    over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties,
    and rulers of tens:'
  '2': '&l22&rAnd let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that
    every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall
    judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with
    thee. &l23&rIf thou'
  '3': shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. &l24&rSo Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. &l25&rAnd Moses chose able
  '4': 'men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands,
    rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. &l26&rAnd they judged
    the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every
    small matter'
  '5': they judged themselves. &l27&rAnd Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
  '6': Chapter 19/nIn the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. &l2&rFor they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in
  '7': the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. &l3&rAnd Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; &l4&rYe have seen what I did
  '8': 'unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles'' wings, and brought you
    unto myself. &l5&rNow therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
    covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all
    the earth is mine:'
  '9': '&l6&rAnd ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These
    are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. &l7&rAnd Moses
    came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all
    these words which'
  '10': the Lord commanded him. &l8&rAnd all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord. &l9&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that
  '11': the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord. &l10&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,
  '12': '&l11&rAnd be ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will
    come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. &l12&rAnd thou shalt
    set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that
    ye go not up into the'
  '13': 'mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely
    put to death: &l13&rThere shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned,
    or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet
    soundeth'
  '14': 'long, they shall come up to the mount. &l14&rAnd Moses went down from the
    mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
    &l15&rAnd he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at
    your wives. &l16&rAnd'
  '15': it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. &l17&rAnd Moses brought forth the
  '16': 'people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part
    of the mount. &l18&rAnd mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord
    descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace,
    and the whole'
  '17': 'mount quaked greatly. &l19&rAnd when the voice of the trumpet sounded long,
    and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. &l20&rAnd
    the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the Lord called
    Moses up to'
  '18': the top of the mount; and Moses went up. &l21&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish. &l22&rAnd let the priests also, which come near to the Lord, sanctify
  '19': 'themselves, lest the Lord break forth upon them. &l23&rAnd Moses said unto
    the Lord, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying,
    Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. &l24&rAnd the Lord said unto him,
    Away, get thee'
  '20': 'down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the
    priests and the people break through to come up unto the Lord, lest he break forth
    upon them. &l25&rSo Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.'
  '21': Chapter 20/nAnd God spake all these words, saying, &l2&rI am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. &l3&rThou shalt have no other gods before me. &l4&rThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,
  '22': 'or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
    beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. &l5&rThou shalt not bow down
    thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting
    the iniquity of'
  '23': the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; &l6&rAnd shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. &l7&rThou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will
  '24': 'not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. &l8&rRemember the sabbath
    day, to keep it holy. &l9&rSix days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: &l10&rBut
    the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any
    work, thou,'
  '25': 'nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy
    cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: &l11&rFor in six days the Lord
    made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh
    day: wherefore the'
  '26': 'Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. &l12&rHonour thy father and
    thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth
    thee. &l13&rThou shalt not kill. &l14&rThou shalt not commit adultery. &l15&rThou
    shalt not steal.'
  '27': '&l16&rThou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. &l17&rThou
    shalt not covet thy neighbour''s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour''s
    wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any
    thing that is thy'
  '28': 'neighbour''s. &l18&rAnd all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,
    and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw
    it, they removed, and stood afar off. &l19&rAnd they said unto Moses, Speak thou
    with us, and we'
  '29': 'will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. &l20&rAnd Moses said
    unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may
    be before your faces, that ye sin not. &l21&rAnd the people stood afar off, and
    Moses drew near unto'
  '30': the thick darkness where God was. &l22&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. &l23&rYe shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods
  '31': 'of gold. &l24&rAn altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
    thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen:
    in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.
    &l25&rAnd if'
  '32': 'thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone:
    for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. &l26&rNeither shalt
    thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.'
  '33': 'Chapter 21/nNow these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
    &l2&rIf thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh
    he shall go out free for nothing. &l3&rIf he came in by himself, he shall go out
    by himself: if he'
  '34': were married, then his wife shall go out with him. &l4&rIf his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. &l5&rAnd if the servant shall plainly
  '35': 'say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
    &l6&rThen his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him
    to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through
    with an aul; and he shall'
  '36': 'serve him for ever. &l7&rAnd if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant,
    she shall not go out as the menservants do. &l8&rIf she please not her master,
    who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell
    her unto a strange'
  '37': nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. &l9&rAnd if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. &l10&rIf he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of
  '38': marriage, shall he not diminish. &l11&rAnd if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money. &l12&rHe that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death. &l13&rAnd if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into
  '39': his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. &l14&rBut if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. &l15&rAnd he that smiteth his father, or his mother,
  '40': shall be surely put to death. &l16&rAnd he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. &l17&rAnd he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death. &l18&rAnd if men strive
  '41': 'together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die
    not, but keepeth his bed: &l19&rIf he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff,
    then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time,
    and shall cause'
  '42': 'him to be thoroughly healed. &l20&rAnd if a man smite his servant, or his
    maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished. &l21&rNotwithstanding,
    if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money. &l22&rIf'
  '43': 'men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her,
    and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman''s
    husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. &l23&rAnd
    if any mischief'
  '44': follow, then thou shalt give life for life, &l24&rEye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, &l25&rBurning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. &l26&rAnd if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it
  '45': 'perish; he shall let him go free for his eye''s sake. &l27&rAnd if he smite
    out his manservant''s tooth, or his maidservant''s tooth; he shall let him go
    free for his tooth''s sake. &l28&rIf an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die:
    then the ox shall be'
  '46': surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. &l29&rBut if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or
  '47': a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death. &l30&rIf there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. &l31&rWhether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter,
  '48': according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. &l32&rIf the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. &l33&rAnd if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig
  '49': a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; &l34&rThe owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his. &l35&rAnd if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell
  '50': the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide. &l36&rOr if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.

    to observe the'
  '37': 'sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. &l17&rIt
    is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the
    Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.
    &l18&rAnd he gave unto'
  '38': Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
  '39': Chapter 32/nAnd when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out
  '40': of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. &l2&rAnd Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. &l3&rAnd all the people brake off the
  '41': 'golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. &l4&rAnd
    he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he
    had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought
    thee up out'
  '42': of the land of Egypt. &l5&rAnd when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the Lord. &l6&rAnd they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and
  '43': 'the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. &l7&rAnd the
    Lord said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest
    out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: &l8&rThey have turned aside
    quickly out of the'
  '44': 'way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped
    it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which
    have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. &l9&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses,
    I have seen'
  '45': 'this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: &l10&rNow therefore
    let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them:
    and I will make of thee a great nation. &l11&rAnd Moses besought the Lord his
    God, and said, Lord,'
  '46': why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? &l12&rWherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the
  '47': mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. &l13&rRemember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will
  '48': multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. &l14&rAnd the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. &l15&rAnd Moses turned, and
  '49': 'went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his
    hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the
    other were they written. &l16&rAnd the tables were the work of God, and the writing
    was the writing of'
  '50': God, graven upon the tables. &l17&rAnd when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

    among their enemies:)'

    side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together
    unto him. &l27&rAnd he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put
    every man his'

    and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his
    neighbour. &l28&rAnd the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses:
    and there fell of the'
  '8': people that day about three thousand men. &l29&rFor Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. &l30&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that
  '9': 'Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go
    up unto the Lord; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. &l31&rAnd
    Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin,
    and have made them'
  '10': gods of gold. &l32&rYet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. &l33&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. &l34&rTherefore
  '11': 'now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee:
    behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit
    I will visit their sin upon them. &l35&rAnd the Lord plagued the people, because
    they made the calf,'
  '12': which Aaron made.
  '13': 'Chapter 33/nAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and
    the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land
    which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will
    I give it: &l2&rAnd I'
  '14': 'will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite,

    thou art a'
  '15': 'stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. &l4&rAnd when the people
    heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
    &l5&rFor the Lord had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are
    a stiffnecked'
  '16': 'people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee:
    therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto
    thee. &l6&rAnd the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by
    the mount Horeb.'
  '17': '&l7&rAnd Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar
    off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came
    to pass, that every one which sought the Lord went out unto the tabernacle of

  '18': was without the camp. &l8&rAnd it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. &l9&rAnd it came to pass, as Moses
  '19': 'entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the

    a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant
    Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. &l12&rAnd
    Moses said unto'
  '21': 'the Lord, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not

    find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. &l14&rAnd
    he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. &l15&rAnd

  '24': 'upon the face of the earth. &l17&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, I will do
    this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight,
    and I know thee by name. &l18&rAnd he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.
    &l19&rAnd he said, I will'
  '25': 'make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the
    Lord before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew
    mercy on whom I will shew mercy. &l20&rAnd he said, Thou canst not see my face:
    for there shall no'
  '26': 'man see me, and live. &l21&rAnd the Lord said, Behold, there is a place by
    me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: &l22&rAnd it shall come to pass, while my
    glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover

  '28': 'Chapter 34/nAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like

    first tables, which thou brakest. &l2&rAnd be ready in the morning, and come up
    in the morning unto'
  '29': mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. &l3&rAnd no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. &l4&rAnd he hewed two tables of
  '30': stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. &l5&rAnd the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed
  '31': the name of the Lord. &l6&rAnd the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, &l7&rKeeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin,
  '32': and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. &l8&rAnd Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
  '33': worshipped. &l9&rAnd he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance. &l10&rAnd he said, Behold, I make a

    done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou
    art shall see the work of the Lord: for it is a terrible thing that I will do
    with thee. &l11&rObserve'
  '35': 'thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee
    the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite,
    and the Jebusite. &l12&rTake heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
    inhabitants of the'
  '36': 'land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: &l13&rBut
    ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:

    thy sons, and their'

  '39': 'the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.

    &l21&rSix days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing
    time and in harvest'
  '41': thou shalt rest. &l22&rAnd thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. &l23&rThrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel.
  '42': '&l24&rFor I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders:

    have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. &l28&rAnd he was there with the
    Lord forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And
    he wrote upon the'
  '45': tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. &l29&rAnd it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone
  '46': while he talked with him. &l30&rAnd when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. &l31&rAnd Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned
  '47': 'unto him: and Moses talked with them. &l32&rAnd afterward all the children
    of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken
    with him in mount Sinai. &l33&rAnd till Moses had done speaking with them, he
    put a vail on his'
  '48': face. &l34&rBut when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. &l35&rAnd the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that
  '49': 'the skin of Moses'' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again,
    until he went in to speak with him.'
  '50': Chapter 35/nAnd Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the Lord hath commanded, that ye should do them.

  '9': departed from the presence of Moses. &l21&rAnd they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the Lord's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and
  '10': 'for the holy garments. &l22&rAnd they came, both men and women, as many as
    were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets,
    all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto
    the Lord.'
  '11': '&l23&rAnd every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
    fine linen, and goats'' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers'' skins, brought
    them. &l24&rEvery one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the
    Lord''s offering:'
  '12': and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it. &l25&rAnd all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of
  '13': fine linen. &l26&rAnd all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair. &l27&rAnd the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; &l28&rAnd spice, and oil for the light, and for the
  '14': anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. &l29&rThe children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of
  '15': Moses. &l30&rAnd Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the Lord hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; &l31&rAnd he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge,
  '16': and in all manner of workmanship; &l32&rAnd to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, &l33&rAnd in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work. &l34&rAnd he hath put in his
  '17': heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. &l35&rThem hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in
  '18': purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.
  '19': Chapter 36/nThen wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the Lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the Lord had commanded. &l2&rAnd Moses
  '20': 'called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the
    Lord had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the
    work to do it: &l3&rAnd they received of Moses all the offering, which the children
    of Israel had'
  '21': brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning. &l4&rAnd all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;
  '22': '&l5&rAnd they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough
    for the service of the work, which the Lord commanded to make. &l6&rAnd Moses
    gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying,
    Let neither man'
  '23': nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. &l7&rFor the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much. &l8&rAnd every wise hearted man among them that wrought the
  '24': 'work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue,
    and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them. &l9&rThe
    length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain
    four cubits: the'
  '25': 'curtains were all of one size. &l10&rAnd he coupled the five curtains one
    unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another. &l11&rAnd
    he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling:
    likewise he made'
  '26': 'in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.
    &l12&rFifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge
    of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain
    to another. &l13&rAnd'
  '27': 'he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with
    the taches: so it became one tabernacle. &l14&rAnd he made curtains of goats''
    hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. &l15&rThe
    length of one curtain'
  '28': 'was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven
    curtains were of one size. &l16&rAnd he coupled five curtains by themselves, and
    six curtains by themselves. &l17&rAnd he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge
    of the curtain'
  '29': in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. &l18&rAnd he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. &l19&rAnd he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,
  '30': and a covering of badgers' skins above that. &l20&rAnd he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up. &l21&rThe length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half. &l22&rOne board had two tenons, equally
  '31': 'distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
    &l23&rAnd he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side
    southward: &l24&rAnd forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards;
    two sockets under'
  '32': one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. &l25&rAnd for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, &l26&rAnd their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
  '33': board, and two sockets under another board. &l27&rAnd for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. &l28&rAnd two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. &l29&rAnd they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at
  '34': 'the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.
    &l30&rAnd there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver,
    under every board two sockets. &l31&rAnd he made bars of shittim wood; five for
    the boards'
  '35': of the one side of the tabernacle, &l32&rAnd five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward. &l33&rAnd he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end
  '36': 'to the other. &l34&rAnd he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their
    rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. &l35&rAnd
    he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims
    made he it'
  '37': 'of cunning work. &l36&rAnd he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood,
    and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four
    sockets of silver. &l37&rAnd he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue,
    and purple, and'
  '38': 'scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework; &l38&rAnd the five pillars
    of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with
    gold: but their five sockets were of brass.'
  '39': 'Chapter 37/nAnd Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half
    was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and
    a half the height of it: &l2&rAnd he overlaid it with pure gold within and without,
    and made a'
  '40': crown of gold to it round about. &l3&rAnd he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it. &l4&rAnd he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them
  '41': 'with gold. &l5&rAnd he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the
    ark, to bear the ark. &l6&rAnd he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits
    and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
    &l7&rAnd he made two'
  '42': 'cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends
    of the mercy seat; &l8&rOne cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub
    on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on
    the two ends thereof.'
  '43': '&l9&rAnd the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their
    wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy
    seatward were the faces of the cherubims. &l10&rAnd he made the table of shittim
    wood: two cubits'
  '44': 'was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and
    a half the height thereof: &l11&rAnd he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto
    a crown of gold round about. &l12&rAlso he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth
    round'
  '45': about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about. &l13&rAnd he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof. &l14&rOver against the border were the rings, the places for the
  '46': staves to bear the table. &l15&rAnd he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. &l16&rAnd he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of
  '47': 'pure gold. &l17&rAnd he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work
    made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and
    his flowers, were of the same: &l18&rAnd six branches going out of the sides thereof;
    three branches of'
  '48': 'the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick
    out of the other side thereof: &l19&rThree bowls made after the fashion of almonds

  '33': put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it. &l19&rAnd they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward. &l20&rAnd they made two other golden rings,
  '34': and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. &l21&rAnd they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace
  '35': of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l22&rAnd he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. &l23&rAnd there was an hole in
  '36': the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend. &l24&rAnd they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen. &l25&rAnd they made bells of pure
  '37': gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates; &l26&rA bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the Lord commanded Moses.
  '38': '&l27&rAnd they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for

  '40': 'fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l32&rThus

  '45': the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office. &l42&rAccording to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work. &l43&rAnd Moses did look upon all the
  '46': 'work, and, behold, they had done it as the Lord had commanded, even so had
    they done it: and Moses blessed them.'
  '47': Chapter 40/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rOn the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. &l3&rAnd thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.
  '48': '&l4&rAnd thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that
    are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light
    the lamps thereof. &l5&rAnd thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before
    the ark of the'
  '49': testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. &l6&rAnd thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. &l7&rAnd thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation
  '50': and the altar, and shalt put water therein. &l8&rAnd thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.

  '1': 'Chapter 40 Cont./n&l9&rAnd thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the
    tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels
    thereof: and it shall be holy. &l10&rAnd thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt
    offering, and all'
  '2': 'his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. &l11&rAnd
    thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. &l12&rAnd thou shalt
    bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
    and wash them'
  '3': 'with water. &l13&rAnd thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint
    him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest''s office. &l14&rAnd
    thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: &l15&rAnd thou shalt anoint
    them, as'
  '4': 'thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest''s
    office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout
    their generations. &l16&rThus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded
    him, so did'
  '5': he. &l17&rAnd it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. &l18&rAnd Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars
  '6': thereof, and reared up his pillars. &l19&rAnd he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l20&rAnd he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark,
  '7': 'and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: &l21&rAnd he brought the ark into
    the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the
    testimony; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l22&rAnd he put the table in the tent
    of the congregation,'
  '8': upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. &l23&rAnd he set the bread in order upon it before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. &l24&rAnd he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side
  '9': 'of the tabernacle southward. &l25&rAnd he lighted the lamps before the Lord;
    as the Lord commanded Moses. &l26&rAnd he put the golden altar in the tent of
    the congregation before the vail: &l27&rAnd he burnt sweet incense thereon; as
    the Lord commanded'
  '10': Moses. &l28&rAnd he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle. &l29&rAnd he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the Lord
  '11': 'commanded Moses. &l30&rAnd he set the laver between the tent of the congregation
    and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal. &l31&rAnd Moses and Aaron
    and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: &l32&rWhen they went into
    the tent of the'
  '12': congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l33&rAnd he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. &l34&rThen a
  '13': cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. &l35&rAnd Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
  '14': '&l36&rAnd when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children
    of Israel went onward in all their journeys: &l37&rBut if the cloud were not taken
    up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. &l38&rFor the cloud
    of the Lord'
  '15': was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
