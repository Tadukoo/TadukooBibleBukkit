  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day
    of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens
    were opened, and I saw visions of God. &l2&rIn the fifth day of the month, which'
  '2': was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity, &l3&rThe word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him. &l4&rAnd I looked, and,
  '3': behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. &l5&rAlso out of the midst thereof came the likeness of
  '4': 'four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness
    of a man. &l6&rAnd every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. &l7&rAnd
    their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of
    a calf''s foot:'
  '5': and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. &l8&rAnd they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings. &l9&rTheir wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went;
  '6': 'they went every one straight forward. &l10&rAs for the likeness of their faces,
    they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and
    they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face
    of an eagle.'
  '7': '&l11&rThus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings
    of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. &l12&rAnd
    they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went;
    and they turned'
  '8': 'not when they went. &l13&rAs for the likeness of the living creatures, their
    appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it
    went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out
    of the fire went'
  '9': forth lightning. &l14&rAnd the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. &l15&rNow as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. &l16&rThe appearance of
  '10': 'the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four
    had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in
    the middle of a wheel. &l17&rWhen they went, they went upon their four sides:
    and they turned not'
  '11': 'when they went. &l18&rAs for their rings, they were so high that they were
    dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four. &l19&rAnd when
    the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures
    were lifted up'
  '12': 'from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. &l20&rWhithersoever the spirit
    was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted
    up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
    &l21&rWhen those went,'
  '13': 'these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted
    up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit
    of the living creature was in the wheels. &l22&rAnd the likeness of the firmament
    upon the heads of the'
  '14': 'living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth
    over their heads above. &l23&rAnd under the firmament were their wings straight,
    the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every
    one had two,'
  '15': 'which covered on that side, their bodies. &l24&rAnd when they went, I heard
    the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the
    Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they
    let down their wings.'
  '16': '&l25&rAnd there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads,
    when they stood, and had let down their wings. &l26&rAnd above the firmament that
    was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire
    stone: and upon'
  '17': the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. &l27&rAnd I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his
  '18': loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. &l28&rAs the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the
  '19': likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
  '20': 'Chapter 2

    And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.
    &l2&rAnd the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my
    feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. &l3&rAnd he said unto me, Son of man,
    I'
  '21': 'send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled
    against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this
    very day. &l4&rFor they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee
    unto them; and'
  '22': thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God. &l5&rAnd they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. &l6&rAnd thou, son of man, be not afraid of
  '23': 'them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with
    thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be
    dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. &l7&rAnd thou shalt
    speak my words unto'
  '24': 'them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are
    most rebellious. &l8&rBut thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not
    thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give
    thee. &l9&rAnd when I'
  '25': 'looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;
    &l10&rAnd he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there
    was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.'
  '26': 'Chapter 3

    Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and
    go speak unto the house of Israel. &l2&rSo I opened my mouth, and he caused me
    to eat that roll. &l3&rAnd he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat,
    and'
  '27': fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. &l4&rAnd he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. &l5&rFor thou art not sent to
  '28': a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel; &l6&rNot to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto
  '29': 'thee. &l7&rBut the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will
    not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.
    &l8&rBehold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead
    strong against their'
  '30': 'foreheads. &l9&rAs an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead:
    fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious
    house. &l10&rMoreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak
    unto thee receive in'
  '31': thine heart, and hear with thine ears. &l11&rAnd go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord God; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. &l12&rThen the
  '32': spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place. &l13&rI heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over
  '33': against them, and a noise of a great rushing. &l14&rSo the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me. &l15&rThen I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that
  '34': dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days. &l16&rAnd it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, &l17&rSon of man, I have made thee a watchman
  '35': 'unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them
    warning from me. &l18&rWhen I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and
    thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way,
    to save his life;'
  '36': the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. &l19&rYet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
  '37': '&l20&rAgain, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit
    iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast
    not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he
    hath done shall'
  '38': not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. &l21&rNevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul. &l22&rAnd the
  '39': 'hand of the Lord was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth
    into the plain, and I will there talk with thee. &l23&rThen I arose, and went
    forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, as the glory
    which I saw by the'
  '40': 'river of Chebar: and I fell on my face. &l24&rThen the spirit entered into
    me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself
    within thine house. &l25&rBut thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands
    upon thee, and'
  '41': 'shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: &l26&rAnd
    I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb,
    and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house. &l27&rBut
    when I speak with'
  '42': 'thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the
    Lord God; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear:
    for they are a rebellious house.'
  '43': 'Chapter 4

    Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray
    upon it the city, even Jerusalem: &l2&rAnd lay siege against it, and build a fort
    against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set'
  '44': 'battering rams against it round about. &l3&rMoreover take thou unto thee
    an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set
    thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against
    it. This shall be a sign'
  '45': 'to the house of Israel. &l4&rLie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the
    iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that
    thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity. &l5&rFor I have laid upon
    thee the years of'
  '46': 'their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety
    days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. &l6&rAnd when thou
    hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity
    of the'
  '47': 'house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year. &l7&rTherefore
    thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be
    uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it. &l8&rAnd, behold, I will lay bands
    upon thee,'
  '48': and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege. &l9&rTake thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof,
  '49': 'according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three
    hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof. &l10&rAnd thy meat which thou
    shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou
    eat it. &l11&rThou'
  '50': 'shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to
    time shalt thou drink. &l12&rAnd thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt
    bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.'

    &l13&rAnd the Lord said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled
    bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them. &l14&rThen said I, Ah Lord
    God! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till'
  '2': now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth. &l15&rThen he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.
  '3': '&l16&rMoreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff

    And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber''s razor, and
    cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to
    weigh, and divide the hair. &l2&rThou shalt burn with fire a third part in the
    midst of'
  '6': 'the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a

  '8': 'have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about
    her. &l6&rAnd she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations,
    and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have
    refused my'
  '9': judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them. &l7&rTherefore thus saith the Lord God; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done
  '10': according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you; &l8&rTherefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations. &l9&rAnd I will do in thee that
  '11': which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations. &l10&rTherefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and
  '12': the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds. &l11&rWherefore, as I live, saith the Lord God; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish
  '13': 'thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity. &l12&rA
    third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be
    consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round
    about thee; and I will'

    them. &l13&rThus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to
    rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the Lord have
    spoken it in my'

  '16': astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the Lord have spoken it. &l16&rWhen I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their
  '17': 'destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the
    famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread: &l17&rSo will I send upon
    you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee: and pestilence and blood

  '19': 'Chapter 6

    And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, set thy face toward

  '25': they shall know that I am the Lord, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them. &l11&rThus saith the Lord God; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for
  '26': 'they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. &l12&rHe
    that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by
    the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus
    will I accomplish my'

  '28': 'where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols. &l14&rSo will I stretch
    out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the
    wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that

  '41': 'their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them. &l21&rAnd
    I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of
    the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it. &l22&rMy face will I turn also
    from them,'
  '42': 'and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into
    it, and defile it. &l23&rMake a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes,
    and the city is full of violence. &l24&rWherefore I will bring the worst of the
    heathen, and they shall'
  '43': 'possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and
    their holy places shall be defiled. &l25&rDestruction cometh; and they shall seek
    peace, and there shall be none. &l26&rMischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour
    shall be upon'
  '44': rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. &l27&rThe king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be

  '49': behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain. &l5&rThen said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold

    now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. &l9&rAnd he
    said unto me, Go in, and'
  '3': behold the wicked abominations that they do here. &l10&rSo I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about. &l11&rAnd there stood before them
  '4': seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up. &l12&rThen said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
  '5': ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the Lord seeth us not; the Lord hath forsaken the earth. &l13&rHe said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that
  '6': they do. &l14&rThen he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. &l15&rThen said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt
  '7': see greater abominations than these. &l16&rAnd he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple
  '8': of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. &l17&rThen he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here?
  '9': 'for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke
    me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. &l18&rTherefore will
    I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though
    they cry in mine'
  '10': ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.
  '11': 'Chapter 9

    He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge
    over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.
    &l2&rAnd, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth'
  '12': 'toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man
    among them was clothed with linen, with a writer''s inkhorn by his side: and they
    went in, and stood beside the brasen altar. &l3&rAnd the glory of the God of Israel
    was gone up'
  '13': from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side; &l4&rAnd the Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem,
  '14': 'and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all
    the abominations that be done in the midst thereof. &l5&rAnd to the others he
    said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your
    eye spare, neither'
  '15': 'have ye pity: &l6&rSlay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children,
    and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary.
    Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house. &l7&rAnd he said
    unto'
  '16': 'them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth.
    And they went forth, and slew in the city. &l8&rAnd it came to pass, while they
    were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said,
    Ah Lord God! wilt'
  '17': 'thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon
    Jerusalem? &l9&rThen said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and
    Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of
    perverseness: for they'
  '18': say, The Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not. &l10&rAnd as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head. &l11&rAnd, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the
  '19': inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.
  '20': 'Chapter 10

    Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims
    there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the
    likeness of a throne. &l2&rAnd he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and'
  '21': said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight. &l3&rNow the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man
  '22': went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. &l4&rThen the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's glory.
  '23': '&l5&rAnd the sound of the cherubims'' wings was heard even to the outer court,
    as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. &l6&rAnd it came to pass, that
    when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between
    the wheels,'
  '24': from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels. &l7&rAnd one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was
  '25': 'clothed with linen: who took it, and went out. &l8&rAnd there appeared in
    the cherubims the form of a man''s hand under their wings. &l9&rAnd when I looked,
    behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another
    wheel by another'
  '26': 'cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.
    &l10&rAnd as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel
    had been in the midst of a wheel. &l11&rWhen they went, they went upon their four
    sides; they turned'
  '27': not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. &l12&rAnd their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that
  '28': 'they four had. &l13&rAs for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing,
    O wheel. &l14&rAnd every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a
    cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a
    lion, and the fourth'
  '29': 'the face of an eagle. &l15&rAnd the cherubims were lifted up. This is the
    living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. &l16&rAnd when the cherubims
    went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to
    mount up from the'
  '30': 'earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. &l17&rWhen they
    stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also:
    for the spirit of the living creature was in them. &l18&rThen the glory of the
    Lord departed from'
  '31': 'off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims. &l19&rAnd the
    cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when
    they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door
    of the east gate'
  '32': of the Lord's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. &l20&rThis is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims. &l21&rEvery one had four faces apiece, and
  '33': 'every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their
    wings. &l22&rAnd the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by
    the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight
    forward.'
  '34': 'Chapter 11

    Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the Lord''s
    house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty
    men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah,'
  '35': 'princes of the people. &l2&rThen said he unto me, Son of man, these are the
    men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: &l3&rWhich say,
    It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.
    &l4&rTherefore'
  '36': 'prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man. &l5&rAnd the Spirit of the
    Lord fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the Lord; Thus have ye
    said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every
    one of them. &l6&rYe have'
  '37': 'multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof
    with the slain. &l7&rTherefore thus saith the Lord God; Your slain whom ye have
    laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but
    I will bring you forth'
  '38': out of the midst of it. &l8&rYe have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord God. &l9&rAnd I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. &l10&rYe
  '39': 'shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye
    shall know that I am the Lord. &l11&rThis city shall not be your caldron, neither
    shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border
    of Israel: &l12&rAnd'
  '40': 'ye shall know that I am the Lord: for ye have not walked in my statutes,
    neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen
    that are round about you. &l13&rAnd it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah
    the son of Benaiah'
  '41': died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord God! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel? &l14&rAgain the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, &l15&rSon of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men
  '42': 'of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the
    inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the Lord: unto us is this
    land given in possession. &l16&rTherefore say, Thus saith the Lord God; Although
    I have cast them far'
  '43': off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. &l17&rTherefore say, Thus saith the Lord God; I will even gather you from the people, and
  '44': assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. &l18&rAnd they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. &l19&rAnd I
  '45': 'will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will
    take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:
    &l20&rThat they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them:
    and they shall be my'
  '46': people, and I will be their God. &l21&rBut as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord God. &l22&rThen did the cherubims lift up their
  '47': wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. &l23&rAnd the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. &l24&rAfterwards the spirit
  '48': took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. &l25&rThen I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the Lord had shewed me.
  '49': 'Chapter 12

    The word of the Lord also came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, thou dwellest

  '28': bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies? &l20&rWherefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to

    Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me. &l2&rAnd

    out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will
    send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it: &l14&rThough these

    and'
  '4': thy mother an Hittite. &l4&rAnd as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. &l5&rNone eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto
  '5': thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born. &l6&rAnd when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy
  '6': 'blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live. &l7&rI
    have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased
    and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned,
    and thine hair'
  '7': 'is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare. &l8&rNow when I passed by thee,
    and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt
    over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into
    a covenant with'
  '8': thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine. &l9&rThen washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil. &l10&rI clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I
  '9': girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk. &l11&rI decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. &l12&rAnd I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful
  '10': 'crown upon thine head. &l13&rThus wast thou decked with gold and silver;
    and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat
    fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst
    prosper into a'
  '11': 'kingdom. &l14&rAnd thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty:
    for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the
    Lord God. &l15&rBut thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot
    because of thy'
  '12': 'renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his
    it was. &l16&rAnd of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places
    with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things shall
    not come, neither shall'
  '13': 'it be so. &l17&rThou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
    silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst
    commit whoredom with them, &l18&rAnd tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst
    them: and thou hast'
  '14': 'set mine oil and mine incense before them. &l19&rMy meat also which I gave
    thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set
    it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord God. &l20&rMoreover
    thou hast taken'
  '15': thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, &l21&rThat thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire
  '16': for them? &l22&rAnd in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood. &l23&rAnd it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith
  '17': the Lord God;) &l24&rThat thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street. &l25&rThou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to
  '18': every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms. &l26&rThou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger. &l27&rBehold, therefore I have stretched out my
  '19': hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way. &l28&rThou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou
  '20': wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied. &l29&rThou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith. &l30&rHow weak is thine
  '21': heart, saith the Lord God, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman; &l31&rIn that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in
  '22': 'that thou scornest hire; &l32&rBut as a wife that committeth adultery, which
    taketh strangers instead of her husband! &l33&rThey give gifts to all whores:
    but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come
    unto thee on every'
  '23': 'side for thy whoredom. &l34&rAnd the contrary is in thee from other women
    in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that
    thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.
    &l35&rWherefore, O'
  '24': 'harlot, hear the word of the Lord: &l36&rThus saith the Lord God; Because
    thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms
    with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood
    of thy children, which'
  '25': thou didst give unto them; &l37&rBehold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover
  '26': thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. &l38&rAnd I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy. &l39&rAnd I will also give thee into their hand, and they
  '27': 'shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places:
    they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and
    leave thee naked and bare. &l40&rThey shall also bring up a company against thee,
    and they shall'
  '28': 'stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords. &l41&rAnd
    they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the
    sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and
    thou also shalt'
  '29': give no hire any more. &l42&rSo will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. &l43&rBecause thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these
  '30': 'things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head,
    saith the Lord God: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.
    &l44&rBehold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee,
    saying, As'
  '31': 'is the mother, so is her daughter. &l45&rThou art thy mother''s daughter,
    that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters,
    which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and
    your father an'
  '32': 'Amorite. &l46&rAnd thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that
    dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand,
    is Sodom and her daughters. &l47&rYet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor
    done after their'
  '33': 'abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted
    more than they in all thy ways. &l48&rAs I live, saith the Lord God, Sodom thy
    sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.
    &l49&rBehold,'
  '34': 'this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance
    of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand
    of the poor and needy. &l50&rAnd they were haughty, and committed abomination
    before me:'
  '35': therefore I took them away as I saw good. &l51&rNeither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done. &l52&rThou also,
  '36': 'which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou
    hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea,
    be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
    &l53&rWhen I'
  '37': 'shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters,
    and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity
    of thy captives in the midst of them: &l54&rThat thou mayest bear thine own shame,
    and mayest'
  '38': be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them. &l55&rWhen thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy
  '39': daughters shall return to your former estate. &l56&rFor thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride, &l57&rBefore thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round
  '40': about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about. &l58&rThou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the Lord. &l59&rFor thus saith the Lord God; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the
  '41': oath in breaking the covenant. &l60&rNevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. &l61&rThen thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy
  '42': 'sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for
    daughters, but not by thy covenant. &l62&rAnd I will establish my covenant with
    thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord: &l63&rThat thou mayest remember,
    and be confounded, and'
  '43': never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.

    and brought forth'

  '6': fathers' idols. &l25&rWherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live; &l26&rAnd I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might
  '7': make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the Lord. &l27&rTherefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a
  '8': trespass against me. &l28&rFor when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the
  '9': 'provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and
    poured out there their drink offerings. &l29&rThen I said unto them, What is the
    high place whereunto ye go? And the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.
    &l30&rWherefore say'
  '10': unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations? &l31&rFor when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves
  '11': 'with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you,
    O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord God, I will not be enquired of by
    you. &l32&rAnd that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say,
    We will be as the'
  '12': 'heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone. &l33&rAs
    I live, saith the Lord God, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out
    arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you: &l34&rAnd I will bring you
    out from the'
  '13': people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out. &l35&rAnd I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to
  '14': 'face. &l36&rLike as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the
    land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord God. &l37&rAnd I will
    cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
    &l38&rAnd I will'
  '15': 'purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me:
    I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall
    not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. &l39&rAs
    for you, O house of'
  '16': 'Israel, thus saith the Lord God; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and
    hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no

    the mountain of the'
  '17': 'height of Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel,
    all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I
    require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy
    things. &l41&rI will'
  '18': accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen. &l42&rAnd ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall bring
  '19': you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers. &l43&rAnd there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight
  '20': for all your evils that ye have committed. &l44&rAnd ye shall know that I am the Lord when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord God.

    The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, there were two
    women, the daughters of one mother: &l3&rAnd they committed whoredoms in Egypt;
    they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and
    there'
  '14': 'they bruised the teats of their virginity. &l4&rAnd the names of them were
    Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons
    and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
    &l5&rAnd Aholah'
  '15': played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours, &l6&rWhich were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. &l7&rThus she committed her whoredoms
  '16': 'with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all
    on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself. &l8&rNeither left
    she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and
    they bruised the breasts'
  '17': 'of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her. &l9&rWherefore I have
    delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon

  '18': 'her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed

  '19': '&l12&rShe doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed
    most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
    &l13&rThen I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way, &l14&rAnd
    that she increased'
  '20': 'her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images
    of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion, &l15&rGirded with girdles upon their
    loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look
    to, after the manner of'
  '21': 'the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity: &l16&rAnd as soon
    as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them
    into Chaldea. &l17&rAnd the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and
    they defiled her with'
  '22': 'their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated
    from them. &l18&rSo she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness:
    then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.
    &l19&rYet she'
  '23': multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. &l20&rFor she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
  '24': '&l21&rThus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising
    thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth. &l22&rTherefore, O Aholibah,
    thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from
    whom thy mind'

    with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and
    renowned, all of'

    &l29&rAnd they shall'
  '30': 'deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave
    thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both
    thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. &l30&rI will do these things unto thee, because
    thou hast gone a'

    &l31&rThou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup

    God; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear
    thou also thy lewdness'
  '34': and thy whoredoms. &l36&rThe Lord said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations; &l37&rThat they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they
  '35': 'committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto
    me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them. &l38&rMoreover this they
    have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned
    my sabbaths.'
  '36': '&l39&rFor when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came

  '37': 'a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself,
    paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments, &l41&rAnd satest upon
    a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense
    and mine oil.'
  '38': '&l42&rAnd a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the
    men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets
    upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads. &l43&rThen said I unto
    her that was old'
  '39': 'in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?
    &l44&rYet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot:
    so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women. &l45&rAnd the righteous
    men, they'
  '40': shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. &l46&rFor thus saith the Lord God; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be
  '41': removed and spoiled. &l47&rAnd the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. &l48&rThus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land,
  '42': 'that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. &l49&rAnd they

  '47': cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered. &l9&rTherefore thus saith the Lord God; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great. &l10&rHeap on wood, kindle the
  '48': fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. &l11&rThen set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.
  '49': '&l12&rShe hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth
    out of her: her scum shall be in the fire. &l13&rIn thy filthiness is lewdness:

    I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in
    the morning as I was'
  '4': commanded. &l19&rAnd the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so? &l20&rThen I answered them, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, &l21&rSpeak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God;
  '5': 'Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the
    desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your
    daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword. &l22&rAnd ye shall do as
    I have done: ye shall not'

    your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye
    shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another. &l24&rThus
    Ezekiel is unto you a'

    ye shall know that I am the Lord God. &l25&rAlso, thou son of man, shall it not
    be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the
    desire of their'

    The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, set thy face
    against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them; &l3&rAnd say unto the Ammonites,
    Hear the word of the Lord God; Thus saith the Lord God; Because thou saidst, Aha,'

  '12': 'shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall
    eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. &l5&rAnd I will make Rabbah a stable
    for camels, and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that
    I am the'

  '16': of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations. &l11&rAnd I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the Lord. &l12&rThus saith the Lord God; Because that
  '17': Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; &l13&rTherefore thus saith the Lord God; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I
  '18': 'will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.
    &l14&rAnd I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and
    they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they
    shall know my'

  '4': the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. &l23&rAnd I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. &l24&rAnd I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon,

    And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day
    of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man,
    speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in
    thy'
  '9': greatness? &l3&rBehold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs. &l4&rThe waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running
  '10': round about his plants, and sent her little rivers unto all the trees of the field. &l5&rTherefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters,
  '11': when he shot forth. &l6&rAll the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. &l7&rThus was he fair in his greatness, in the
  '12': 'length of his branches: for his root was by great waters. &l8&rThe cedars
    in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs,
    and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden
    of God was like unto'
  '13': 'him in his beauty. &l9&rI have made him fair by the multitude of his branches:
    so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him. &l10&rTherefore
    thus saith the Lord God; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he
    hath'
  '14': 'shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his
    height; &l11&rI have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of
    the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
    &l12&rAnd'
  '15': 'strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him:
    upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs
    are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are
    gone down from his'
  '16': 'shadow, and have left him. &l13&rUpon his ruin shall all the fowls of the
    heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: &l14&rTo
    the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height,
    neither shoot'
  '17': 'up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their
    height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether
    parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down
    to the pit.'
  '18': '&l15&rThus saith the Lord God; In the day when he went down to the grave
    I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof,
    and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all
    the trees of the'
  '19': 'field fainted for him. &l16&rI made the nations to shake at the sound of
    his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and
    all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall
    be comforted in the'
  '20': nether parts of the earth. &l17&rThey also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen. &l18&rTo whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness
  '21': 'among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of
    Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised
    with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith
    the Lord God.'

  '27': the Lord God. &l9&rI will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known. &l10&rYea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid
  '28': for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. &l11&rFor thus saith the Lord God; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee. &l12&rBy the swords

  '30': the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? &l19&rAnd as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet. &l20&rTherefore thus saith the Lord God unto them; Behold,
  '31': I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle. &l21&rBecause ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad; &l22&rTherefore will I save my flock, and

  '6': 'upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be
    inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded: &l11&rAnd I will multiply upon you
    man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you
    after your old estates,'

    word of the Lord'
  '10': 'came unto me, saying, &l17&rSon of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in
    their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way
    was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman. &l18&rWherefore I poured
    my fury upon them for'
  '11': 'the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith
    they had polluted it: &l19&rAnd I scattered them among the heathen, and they were
    dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their
    doings I judged them.'
  '12': ' &l20&rAnd when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned
    my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the Lord, and are
    gone forth out of his land. &l21&rBut I had pity for mine holy name, which the
    house of Israel'
  '13': had profaned among the heathen, whither they went. &l22&rTherefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord God; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye
  '14': went. &l23&rAnd I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
  '15': '&l24&rFor I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all
    countries, and will bring you into your own land. &l25&rThen will I sprinkle clean
    water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all
    your idols, will I'
  '16': 'cleanse you. &l26&rA new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will
    I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and
    I will give you an heart of flesh. &l27&rAnd I will put my spirit within you,
    and cause you to walk in'
  '17': 'my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. &l28&rAnd ye shall
    dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and
    I will be your God. &l29&rI will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and
    I will call for the'
  '18': corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. &l30&rAnd I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen. &l31&rThen shall ye remember your own evil ways, and
  '19': 'your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight
    for your iniquities and for your abominations. &l32&rNot for your sakes do I this,
    saith the Lord God, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own
    ways, O house'
  '20': of Israel. &l33&rThus saith the Lord God; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded. &l34&rAnd the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
  '21': in the sight of all that passed by. &l35&rAnd they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited. &l36&rThen the heathen that are left round about
  '22': 'you shall know that I the Lord build the ruined places, and plant that that
    was desolate: I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it. &l37&rThus saith the
    Lord God; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it
    for them; I will'
  '23': 'increase them with men like a flock. &l38&rAs the holy flock, as the flock
    of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks
    of men: and they shall know that I am the Lord.'
  '24': 'Chapter 37

    The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord,
    and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones, &l2&rAnd caused
    me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open'
  '25': valley; and, lo, they were very dry. &l3&rAnd he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest. &l4&rAgain he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.
  '26': '&l5&rThus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath
    to enter into you, and ye shall live: &l6&rAnd I will lay sinews upon you, and
    will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you,
    and ye shall live; and'
  '27': 'ye shall know that I am the Lord. &l7&rSo I prophesied as I was commanded:
    and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came
    together, bone to his bone. &l8&rAnd when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh
    came up upon them,'
  '28': 'and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them. &l9&rThen
    said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the
    wind, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe
    upon these slain, that'
  '29': 'they may live. &l10&rSo I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came
    into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
    &l11&rThen he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel:
    behold, they'
  '30': 'say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
    &l12&rTherefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, O
    my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves,
    and bring you into'
  '31': 'the land of Israel. &l13&rAnd ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have
    opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, &l14&rAnd
    shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own
    land: then shall'
  '32': ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord. &l15&rThe word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, &l16&rMoreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his
  '33': 'companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick
    of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his companions: &l17&rAnd join them
    one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. &l18&rAnd
    when the children'
  '34': of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these? &l19&rSay unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and
  '35': will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. &l20&rAnd the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. &l21&rAnd say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold,
  '36': 'I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be
    gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
    &l22&rAnd I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel;
    and one king shall be'
  '37': 'king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they
    be divided into two kingdoms any more at all. &l23&rNeither shall they defile
    themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with
    any of their'
  '38': 'transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein
    they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will
    be their God. &l24&rAnd David my servant shall be king over them; and they all
    shall have one'

    and do them. &l25&rAnd they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob
    my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even
    they, and their'
  '40': 'children, and their children''s children for ever: and my servant David shall
    be their prince for ever. &l26&rMoreover I will make a covenant of peace with
    them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and
    multiply them, and'
  '41': 'will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. &l27&rMy tabernacle
    also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

    thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.
    &l38&rAnd the'
  '5': chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering. &l39&rAnd in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and
  '6': the trespass offering. &l40&rAnd at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables. &l41&rFour tables were on this side, and four tables on that
  '7': 'side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.
    &l42&rAnd the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit
    and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon
    also they laid'
  '8': 'the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
    &l43&rAnd within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the
    tables was the flesh of the offering. &l44&rAnd without the inner gate were the
    chambers of the singers'
  '9': 'in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect
    was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward
    the north. &l45&rAnd he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the
    south, is for'
  '10': 'the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house. &l46&rAnd the chamber
    whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge
    of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near
    to the Lord to'
  '11': minister unto him. &l47&rSo he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house. &l48&rAnd he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits
  '12': 'on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was
    three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. &l49&rThe length of
    the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me
    by the steps whereby'
  '13': 'they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side,
    and another on that side.'
  '14': 'Chapter 41

    Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad
    on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth
    of the tabernacle. &l2&rAnd the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides
    of'
  '15': 'the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side:
    and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.
    &l3&rThen went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the
    door, six'
  '16': 'cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits. &l4&rSo he measured the
    length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple:
    and he said unto me, This is the most holy place. &l5&rAfter he measured the wall
    of the house, six'
  '17': cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. &l6&rAnd the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round
  '18': 'about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the
    house. &l7&rAnd there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the
    side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about
    the house: therefore'
  '19': 'the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest
    chamber to the highest by the midst. &l8&rI saw also the height of the house round
    about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.
    &l9&rThe'
  '20': 'thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits:
    and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within. &l10&rAnd
    between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on
    every'
  '21': 'side. &l11&rAnd the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that
    was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the
    breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about. &l12&rNow the
    building that was before'
  '22': the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. &l13&rSo he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place,
  '23': and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long; &l14&rAlso the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits. &l15&rAnd he measured the length of the building over against the separate
  '24': place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court; &l16&rThe door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three
  '25': stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered; &l17&rTo that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by
  '26': measure. &l18&rAnd it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces; &l19&rSo that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion
  '27': 'toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house
    round about. &l20&rFrom the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm
    trees made, and on the wall of the temple. &l21&rThe posts of the temple were
    squared, and the face of'
  '28': 'the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.
    &l22&rThe altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits;
    and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of
    wood: and he said'
  '29': unto me, This is the table that is before the Lord. &l23&rAnd the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. &l24&rAnd the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door. &l25&rAnd there were
  '30': made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without. &l26&rAnd there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side,
  '31': on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.
  '32': 'Chapter 42

    Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he
    brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which
    was before the building toward the north. &l2&rBefore the length of an hundred
    cubits'
  '33': was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits. &l3&rOver against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories. &l4&rAnd before the
  '34': 'chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and
    their doors toward the north. &l5&rNow the upper chambers were shorter: for the
    galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the
    building. &l6&rFor'
  '35': 'they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts:
    therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost
    from the ground. &l7&rAnd the wall that was without over against the chambers,
    toward the utter'
  '36': 'court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.
    &l8&rFor the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits:
    and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits. &l9&rAnd from under these chambers
    was the'
  '37': entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court. &l10&rThe chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building. &l11&rAnd the way before them was like
  '38': 'the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they,
    and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions,
    and according to their doors. &l12&rAnd according to the doors of the chambers
    that were'
  '39': toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. &l13&rThen said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy
  '40': 'chambers, where the priests that approach unto the Lord shall eat the most
    holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering,
    and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy. &l14&rWhen
    the priests enter'
  '41': therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.
  '42': '&l15&rNow when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought
    me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round
    about. &l16&rHe measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds,
    with the'
  '43': measuring reed round about. &l17&rHe measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. &l18&rHe measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. &l19&rHe turned about to the west side, and measured five
  '44': 'hundred reeds with the measuring reed. &l20&rHe measured it by the four sides:
    it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to
    make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.'
  '45': 'Chapter 43

    Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east:
    &l2&rAnd, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east:
    and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.'
  '46': '&l3&rAnd it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even
    according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions
    were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
    &l4&rAnd the glory'
  '47': of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. &l5&rSo the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house. &l6&rAnd I heard him speaking unto me out of
  '48': the house; and the man stood by me. &l7&rAnd he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more
  '49': defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places. &l8&rIn their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even
  '50': 'defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore
    I have consumed them in mine anger. &l9&rNow let them put away their whoredom,
    and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of
    them for ever.'

  '4': 'the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall
    be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof

  '8': offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon. &l19&rAnd thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord God, a young bullock for a sin offering. &l20&rAnd

    thou cleanse and purge it. &l21&rThou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering,
    and he shall'
  '10': burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. &l22&rAnd on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock. &l23&rWhen
  '11': thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. &l24&rAnd thou shalt offer them before the Lord, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up
  '12': 'for a burnt offering unto the Lord. &l25&rSeven days shalt thou prepare every

    Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh
    toward the east; and it was shut. &l2&rThen said the Lord unto me; This gate shall
    be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the'
  '16': Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. &l3&rIt is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the
  '17': 'same. &l4&rThen brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:
    and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord:
    and I fell upon my face. &l5&rAnd the Lord said unto me, Son of man, mark well,
    and behold with thine'
  '18': eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary. &l6&rAnd thou shalt say to the
  '19': rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, &l7&rIn that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my
  '20': 'sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat
    and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.
    &l8&rAnd ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers
    of my charge in my'

    they shall even bear their iniquity. &l11&rYet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary,
    having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall
    slay'
  '23': the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. &l12&rBecause they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine

    &l13&rAnd they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto
    me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they
    shall bear their shame,'
  '25': and their abominations which they have committed. &l14&rBut I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. &l15&rBut the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge
  '26': 'of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall
    come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto

  '29': into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.
  '30': '&l20&rNeither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow
    long; they shall only poll their heads. &l21&rNeither shall any priest drink wine,

    the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings,
    and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but
    the gate shall not'
  '10': be shut until the evening. &l3&rLikewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the Lord in the sabbaths and in the new moons. &l4&rAnd the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the Lord in the sabbath day shall be
  '11': six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish. &l5&rAnd the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. &l6&rAnd in the day of the new moon it shall be a
  '12': 'young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without
    blemish. &l7&rAnd he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and
    an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto,
    and an hin of oil'
  '13': to an ephah. &l8&rAnd when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. &l9&rBut when the people of the land shall come before the Lord in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by
  '14': 'the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south
    gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the
    way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came
    in, but shall go forth'
  '15': over against it. &l10&rAnd the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth. &l11&rAnd in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to
  '16': the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. &l12&rNow when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the Lord, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall
  '17': 'prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath
    day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
    &l13&rThou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the Lord of a lamb of the
    first year without'
  '18': 'blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning. &l14&rAnd thou shalt prepare
    a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third
    part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually
    by a perpetual'
  '19': ordinance unto the Lord. &l15&rThus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering. &l16&rThus saith the Lord God; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall
  '20': 'be his sons''; it shall be their possession by inheritance. &l17&rBut if
    he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his
    to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance
    shall be his sons'' for'
  '21': 'them. &l18&rMoreover the prince shall not take of the people''s inheritance
    by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons
    inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man
    from his'
  '22': 'possession. &l19&rAfter he brought me through the entry, which was at the
    side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the
    north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward. &l20&rThen said
    he unto me, This is'
  '23': the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people. &l21&rThen he brought me forth into the utter court, and
  '24': 'caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every
    corner of the court there was a court. &l22&rIn the four corners of the court
    there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners
    were of one measure.'
  '25': '&l23&rAnd there was a row of building round about in them, round about them
    four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about. &l24&rThen
    said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of
    the house shall'
  '26': boil the sacrifice of the people.
  '27': 'Chapter 47

    Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters
    issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of
    the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the
    right'
  '28': side of the house, at the south side of the altar. &l2&rThen brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
  '29': '&l3&rAnd when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward,
    he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters
    were to the ankles. &l4&rAgain he measured a thousand, and brought me through
    the waters; the waters'
  '30': 'were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through;
    the waters were to the loins. &l5&rAfterward he measured a thousand; and it was
    a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim
    in, a river that could'
  '31': not be passed over. &l6&rAnd he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river. &l7&rNow when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on
  '32': 'the other. &l8&rThen said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east
    country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought
    forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed. &l9&rAnd it shall come to pass,
    that every thing'
  '33': 'that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live:
    and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall
    come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the
    river cometh. &l10&rAnd'
  '34': it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. &l11&rBut the miry places
  '35': thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt. &l12&rAnd by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be
  '36': 'consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because
    their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be
    for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine. &l13&rThus saith the Lord God; This
    shall be the border,'
  '37': 'whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel:
    Joseph shall have two portions. &l14&rAnd ye shall inherit it, one as well as
    another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers:
    and this land shall'
  '38': fall unto you for inheritance. &l15&rAnd this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad; &l16&rHamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of
  '39': Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran. &l17&rAnd the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side. &l18&rAnd the east side ye shall measure
  '40': from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side. &l19&rAnd the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the
  '41': great sea. And this is the south side southward. &l20&rThe west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side. &l21&rSo shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.
  '42': '&l22&rAnd it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance
    unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children
    among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children
    of Israel;'
  '43': they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. &l23&rAnd it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord God.
  '44': 'Chapter 48

    Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast of the
    way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward,
    to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for Dan.'
  '45': '&l2&rAnd by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a portion
    for Asher. &l3&rAnd by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west
    side, a portion for Naphtali. &l4&rAnd by the border of Naphtali, from the east
    side unto the'
  '46': west side, a portion for Manasseh. &l5&rAnd by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Ephraim. &l6&rAnd by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion for Reuben. &l7&rAnd by the border
  '47': of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Judah. &l8&rAnd by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of
  '48': 'the other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary
    shall be in the midst of it. &l9&rThe oblation that ye shall offer unto the Lord
    shall be of five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth.
    &l10&rAnd for them,'
  '49': 'even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation; toward the north five
    and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and
    toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty
    thousand in length: and'
  '50': the sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the midst thereof. &l11&rIt shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.

    &l12&rAnd this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing
