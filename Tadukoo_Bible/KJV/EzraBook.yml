  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord by the
    mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus
    king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put
    it also'
  '2': in writing, saying, &l2&rThus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. &l3&rWho is there among you of all his people? his
  '3': God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem. &l4&rAnd whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with
  '4': silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem. &l5&rThen rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit
  '5': God had raised, to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem. &l6&rAnd all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was
  '6': willingly offered. &l7&rAlso Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; &l8&rEven those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the
  '7': 'hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the
    prince of Judah. &l9&rAnd this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold,
    a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, &l10&rThirty basons of
    gold, silver basons of a'
  '8': second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. &l11&rAll the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.

  '29': therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood. &l63&rAnd the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim. &l64&rThe whole congregation together was forty

    priests'''
  '33': garments. &l70&rSo the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
  '34': 'Chapter 3

    And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities,
    the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. &l2&rThen stood
    up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the'
  '35': son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. &l3&rAnd they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people
  '36': 'of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the Lord,
    even burnt offerings morning and evening. &l4&rThey kept also the feast of tabernacles,
    as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to
    the custom,'
  '37': as the duty of every day required; &l5&rAnd afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the Lord that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the Lord.
  '38': '&l6&rFrom the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings
    unto the Lord. But the foundation of the temple of the Lord was not yet laid.
    &l7&rThey gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and
    drink, and oil,'
  '39': unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. &l8&rNow in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second
  '40': month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old
  '41': 'and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the Lord. &l9&rThen stood
    Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah,
    together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad,
    with their sons and'
  '42': their brethren the Levites. &l10&rAnd when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the Lord, after the ordinance of David
  '43': king of Israel. &l11&rAnd they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the
  '44': foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. &l12&rBut many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and
  '45': 'many shouted aloud for joy: &l13&rSo that the people could not discern the
    noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the
    people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.'
  '46': 'Chapter 4

    Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the
    captivity builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel; &l2&rThen they came
    to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build
    with you:'
  '47': for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither. &l3&rBut Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do
  '48': with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. &l4&rThen the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in
  '49': building, &l5&rAnd hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. &l6&rAnd in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an
  '50': accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.

    &l7&rAnd in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the
    rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the
    letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.'
  '2': '&l8&rRehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem
    to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: &l9&rThen wrote Rehum the chancellor, and
    Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites,
    the'
  '3': Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites, &l10&rAnd the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this
  '4': side the river, and at such a time. &l11&rThis is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time. &l12&rBe it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up
  '5': from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations. &l13&rBe it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they
  '6': not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings. &l14&rNow because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
  '7': '&l15&rThat search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so
    shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious
    city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition
    within the same of'
  '8': 'old time: for which cause was this city destroyed. &l16&rWe certify the king
    that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means
    thou shalt have no portion on this side the river. &l17&rThen sent the king an
    answer unto Rehum'
  '9': the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time. &l18&rThe letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. &l19&rAnd I
  '10': commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. &l20&rThere have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all
  '11': countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them. &l21&rGive ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me. &l22&rTake heed now that ye fail
  '12': 'not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings? &l23&rNow
    when the copy of king Artaxerxes'' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai
    the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the
    Jews, and made them to'
  '13': cease by force and power. &l24&rThen ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
  '14': 'Chapter 5

    Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied
    unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel,
    even unto them. &l2&rThen rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua
    the'

    and with them were the prophets of God helping them. &l3&rAt the same time came
    to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions,
    and said'
  '16': thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall? &l4&rThen said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building? &l5&rBut the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that
  '17': 'they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then
    they returned answer by letter concerning this matter. &l6&rThe copy of the letter
    that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and his companions
    the'
  '18': 'Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:
    &l7&rThey sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king,
    all peace. &l8&rBe it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea,
    to the house'
  '19': of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands. &l9&rThen asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make
  '20': up these walls? &l10&rWe asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them. &l11&rAnd thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house
  '21': that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up. &l12&rBut after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who
  '22': destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. &l13&rBut in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God. &l14&rAnd the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which
  '23': Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
  '24': '&l15&rAnd said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple
    that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place. &l16&rThen
    came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is
    in Jerusalem: and'
  '25': since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished. &l17&rNow therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was
  '26': made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
  '27': 'Chapter 6

    Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls,
    where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. &l2&rAnd there was found at Achmetha,
    in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a'
  '28': 'record thus written: &l3&rIn the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus
    the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house

  '30': the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God. &l6&rNow
  '31': 'therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions
    the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence: &l7&rLet

  '32': 'build this house of God in his place. &l8&rMoreover I make a decree what
    ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God:
    that of the king''s goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses
    be given unto these'
  '33': men, that they be not hindered. &l9&rAnd that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem,
  '34': 'let it be given them day by day without fail: &l10&rThat they may offer sacrifices
    of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and
    of his sons. &l11&rAlso I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this
    word, let'

  '36': and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed. &l13&rThen Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so
  '37': they did speedily. &l14&rAnd the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according
  '38': to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. &l15&rAnd this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. &l16&rAnd the children of Israel, the priests, and
  '39': the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy. &l17&rAnd offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for
  '40': all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. &l18&rAnd they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
  '41': '&l19&rAnd the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth
    day of the first month. &l20&rFor the priests and the Levites were purified together,
    all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity,
    and'
  '42': for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. &l21&rAnd the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the Lord God of Israel,
  '43': 'did eat, &l22&rAnd kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy:
    for the Lord had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria
    unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God
    of Israel.'

  '3': 'willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem: &l17&rThat thou
    mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings
    and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your
    God which is in'
  '4': Jerusalem. &l18&rAnd whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God. &l19&rThe vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those
  '5': deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. &l20&rAnd whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house. &l21&rAnd I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree
  '6': to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily, &l22&rUnto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to
  '7': 'an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without
    prescribing how much. &l23&rWhatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let
    it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there
    be wrath against the'
  '8': realm of the king and his sons? &l24&rAlso we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them. &l25&rAnd thou,
  '9': Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. &l26&rAnd whosoever will not do the
  '10': law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment. &l27&rBlessed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as
  '11': 'this in the king''s heart, to beautify the house of the Lord which is in
    Jerusalem: &l28&rAnd hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors,
    and before all the king''s mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand
    of the Lord my God'
  '12': was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
  '13': 'Chapter 8

    These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that
    went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king. &l2&rOf the
    sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David;'
  '14': 'Hattush. &l3&rOf the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah:
    and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty. &l4&rOf
    the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred
    males. &l5&rOf'
  '15': the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males. &l6&rOf the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males. &l7&rAnd of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.
  '16': '&l8&rAnd of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with
    him fourscore males. &l9&rOf the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and
    with him two hundred and eighteen males. &l10&rAnd of the sons of Shelomith; the
    son of Josiphiah, and'
  '17': with him an hundred and threescore males. &l11&rAnd of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males. &l12&rAnd of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males. &l13&rAnd of the
  '18': last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males. &l14&rOf the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males. &l15&rAnd I gathered them together to the river that runneth to
  '19': 'Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and
    the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. &l16&rThen sent I for Eliezer,
    for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and
    for Nathan,'
  '20': and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding. &l17&rAnd I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren
  '21': the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God. &l18&rAnd by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and
  '22': Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; &l19&rAnd Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; &l20&rAlso of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the
  '23': 'Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by
    name. &l21&rThen I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might
    afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our
    little ones, and for'
  '24': 'all our substance. &l22&rFor I was ashamed to require of the king a band
    of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had
    spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that
    seek him; but his'
  '25': 'power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. &l23&rSo we fasted
    and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us. &l24&rThen I separated
    twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren
    with them,'
  '26': '&l25&rAnd weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even
    the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and
    his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered: &l26&rI even weighed unto
    their hand six'
  '27': hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents; &l27&rAlso twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold. &l28&rAnd I said unto them, Ye are holy
  '28': unto the Lord; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the Lord God of your fathers. &l29&rWatch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of
  '29': Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the Lord. &l30&rSo took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God. &l31&rThen we departed from the river
  '30': 'of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and
    the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy,
    and of such as lay in wait by the way. &l32&rAnd we came to Jerusalem, and abode
    there three days.'
  '31': '&l33&rNow on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed
    in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and
    with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of
    Jeshua, and'
  '32': 'Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites; &l34&rBy number and by weight of every
    one: and all the weight was written at that time. &l35&rAlso the children of those
    that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt
    offerings unto the'
  '33': 'God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy
    and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering
    unto the Lord. &l36&rAnd they delivered the king''s commissions unto the king''s
    lieutenants, and'
  '34': 'to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and
    the house of God.'
  '35': 'Chapter 9

    Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of
    Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the
    people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites,'
  '36': 'the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites,
    the Egyptians, and the Amorites. &l2&rFor they have taken of their daughters for
    themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves
    with the people of'
  '37': 'those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this
    trespass. &l3&rAnd when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and
    plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied. &l4&rThen
    were assembled'
  '38': unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice. &l5&rAnd at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having
  '39': 'rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands
    unto the Lord my God, &l6&rAnd said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift
    up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and
    our trespass is grown'
  '40': up unto the heavens. &l7&rSince the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a
  '41': spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day. &l8&rAnd now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a
  '42': little reviving in our bondage. &l9&rFor we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the
  '43': desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. &l10&rAnd now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments, &l11&rWhich thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which
  '44': ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness. &l12&rNow therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take
  '45': 'their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for
    ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an
    inheritance to your children for ever. &l13&rAnd after all that is come upon us
    for our evil deeds, and'
  '46': for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this; &l14&rShould we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations?
  '47': 'wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there
    should be no remnant nor escaping? &l15&rO Lord God of Israel, thou art righteous:
    for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our
    trespasses: for'
  '48': we cannot stand before thee because of this.
  '49': 'Chapter 10

    Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself
    down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great
    congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.'
  '50': '&l2&rAnd Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered
    and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange
    wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this
    thing.'

    &l3&rNow therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives,
    and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those
    that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to'
  '2': 'the law. &l4&rArise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be

    this word. And they'
  '3': 'sware. &l6&rThen Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into
    the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat
    no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them

  '7': 'have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel. &l11&rNow therefore
    make confession unto the Lord God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate
