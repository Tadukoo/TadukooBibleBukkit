  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the
    Father, who raised him from the dead;) &l2&rAnd all the brethren which are with
    me, unto the churches of Galatia: &l3&rGrace be to you and peace from God the
    Father,'
  '2': 'and from our Lord Jesus Christ, &l4&rWho gave himself for our sins, that he
    might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and
    our Father: &l5&rTo whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. &l6&rI marvel that
    ye are so soon removed'
  '3': 'from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: &l7&rWhich
    is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel
    of Christ. &l8&rBut though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
    unto you than'
  '4': that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. &l9&rAs we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. &l10&rFor do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to
  '5': please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. &l11&rBut I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. &l12&rFor I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the
  '6': 'revelation of Jesus Christ. &l13&rFor ye have heard of my conversation in
    time past in the Jews'' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church
    of God, and wasted it: &l14&rAnd profited in the Jews'' religion above many my
    equals in mine own'
  '7': nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. &l15&rBut when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, &l16&rTo reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately
  '8': 'I conferred not with flesh and blood: &l17&rNeither went I up to Jerusalem
    to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again
    unto Damascus. &l18&rThen after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter,
    and abode with him'
  '9': fifteen days. &l19&rBut other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. &l20&rNow the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. &l21&rAfterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; &l22&rAnd was unknown by
  '10': 'face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: &l23&rBut they had
    heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith
    which once he destroyed. &l24&rAnd they glorified God in me.'
  '11': 'Chapter 2

    Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took
    Titus with me also. &l2&rAnd I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them
    that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were
    of'
  '12': 'reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. &l3&rBut
    neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
    &l4&rAnd that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily
    to spy out our'
  '13': 'liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
    &l5&rTo whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth
    of the gospel might continue with you. &l6&rBut of these who seemed to be somewhat,
    (whatsoever they'
  '14': 'were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man''s person:) for they
    who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: &l7&rBut contrariwise,
    when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as
    the gospel of the'
  '15': circumcision was unto Peter; &l8&r(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) &l9&rAnd when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that
  '16': was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision. &l10&rOnly they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do. &l11&rBut
  '17': 'when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was
    to be blamed. &l12&rFor before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
    Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing
    them which were of'
  '18': the circumcision. &l13&rAnd the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. &l14&rBut when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter
  '19': before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? &l15&rWe who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, &l16&rKnowing that a man is not
  '20': 'justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even
    we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ,
    and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be
    justified.'
  '21': '&l17&rBut if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also
    are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. &l18&rFor
    if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. &l19&rFor
    I through the'
  '22': 'law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. &l20&rI am crucified
    with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the
    life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who
    loved me, and gave himself'
  '23': 'for me. &l21&rI do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come
    by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.'
  '24': 'Chapter 3

    O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth,
    before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among
    you? &l2&rThis only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works
    of the'
  '25': law, or by the hearing of faith? &l3&rAre ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? &l4&rHave ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. &l5&rHe therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
  '26': miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? &l6&rEven as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. &l7&rKnow ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of
  '27': Abraham. &l8&rAnd the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. &l9&rSo then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
  '28': '&l10&rFor as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for
    it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are
    written in the book of the law to do them. &l11&rBut that no man is justified
    by the law in the sight'
  '29': 'of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. &l12&rAnd the law
    is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. &l13&rChrist
    hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it
    is written, Cursed is'
  '30': 'every one that hangeth on a tree: &l14&rThat the blessing of Abraham might
    come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of
    the Spirit through faith. &l15&rBrethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though
    it be but a man''s'
  '31': covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. &l16&rNow to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. &l17&rAnd this I say, that the
  '32': 'covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was
    four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the
    promise of none effect. &l18&rFor if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more
    of promise: but God'
  '33': gave it to Abraham by promise. &l19&rWherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. &l20&rNow a mediator is not a
  '34': 'mediator of one, but God is one. &l21&rIs the law then against the promises
    of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life,
    verily righteousness should have been by the law. &l22&rBut the scripture hath
    concluded all'
  '35': under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. &l23&rBut before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. &l24&rWherefore the law was our schoolmaster to
  '36': bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. &l25&rBut after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. &l26&rFor ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. &l27&rFor as many of you as have been baptized into
  '37': 'Christ have put on Christ. &l28&rThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is
    neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in
    Christ Jesus. &l29&rAnd if ye be Christ''s, then are ye Abraham''s seed, and heirs
    according to the'
  '38': promise.
  '39': 'Chapter 4

    Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant,
    though he be lord of all; &l2&rBut is under tutors and governors until the time
    appointed of the father. &l3&rEven so we, when we were children, were in bondage'
  '40': 'under the elements of the world: &l4&rBut when the fulness of the time was
    come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, &l5&rTo redeem
    them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. &l6&rAnd
    because ye are'
  '41': sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. &l7&rWherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. &l8&rHowbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto
  '42': them which by nature are no gods. &l9&rBut now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? &l10&rYe observe days, and months, and times, and
  '43': 'years. &l11&rI am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in
    vain. &l12&rBrethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not
    injured me at all. &l13&rYe know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached
    the gospel unto you at'
  '44': the first. &l14&rAnd my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. &l15&rWhere is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye
  '45': would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. &l16&rAm I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? &l17&rThey zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them. &l18&rBut it is
  '46': good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you. &l19&rMy little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, &l20&rI desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for
  '47': I stand in doubt of you. &l21&rTell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? &l22&rFor it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. &l23&rBut he who was of the bondwoman was born after
  '48': 'the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise. &l24&rWhich things are
    an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which
    gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. &l25&rFor this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia,
    and answereth to'
  '49': 'Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. &l26&rBut Jerusalem
    which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. &l27&rFor it is written,
    Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest
    not: for the'
  '50': desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband. &l28&rNow we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. &l29&rBut as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

  '1': 'Chapter 4 Cont.

    &l30&rNevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son:
    for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
    &l31&rSo then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.'
  '2': 'Chapter 5

    Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be
    not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. &l2&rBehold, I Paul say unto you,
    that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. &l3&rFor I testify
    again to'
  '3': every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. &l4&rChrist is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. &l5&rFor we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
  '4': faith. &l6&rFor in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. &l7&rYe did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? &l8&rThis persuasion cometh not of him that calleth
  '5': 'you. &l9&rA little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. &l10&rI have confidence
    in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth
    you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. &l11&rAnd I, brethren, if I yet
    preach'
  '6': circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. &l12&rI would they were even cut off which trouble you. &l13&rFor, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by
  '7': love serve one another. &l14&rFor all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. &l15&rBut if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. &l16&rThis I say then, Walk in
  '8': 'the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. &l17&rFor the flesh
    lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary
    the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. &l18&rBut
    if ye be led'
  '9': of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. &l19&rNow the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, &l20&rIdolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
  '10': '&l21&rEnvyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which
    I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such
    things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. &l22&rBut the fruit of the Spirit
    is love, joy,'
  '11': 'peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, &l23&rMeekness, temperance:
    against such there is no law. &l24&rAnd they that are Christ''s have crucified
    the flesh with the affections and lusts. &l25&rIf we live in the Spirit, let us
    also walk in the'
  '12': Spirit. &l26&rLet us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
  '13': 'Chapter 6

    Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such
    an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
    &l2&rBear ye one another''s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. &l3&rFor
    if a'
  '14': man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. &l4&rBut let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. &l5&rFor every man shall bear his own burden. &l6&rLet him that
  '15': 'is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
    &l7&rBe not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall
    he also reap. &l8&rFor he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption;
    but he that'
  '16': 'soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. &l9&rAnd
    let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint
    not. &l10&rAs we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially
    unto them who are'
  '17': of the household of faith. &l11&rYe see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. &l12&rAs many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of
  '18': Christ. &l13&rFor neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. &l14&rBut God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
  '19': crucified unto me, and I unto the world. &l15&rFor in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. &l16&rAnd as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
  '20': '&l17&rFrom henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks
    of the Lord Jesus. &l18&rBrethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
    your spirit. Amen.'
