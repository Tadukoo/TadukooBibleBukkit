  '1': 'Chapter 1/nIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. &l2&rAnd
    the earth was without form, and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
    &l3&rAnd God said, Let there be light: and there was light. &l4&rAnd God saw the
    light, that it was'
  '2': 'good: and God divided the light from the darkness. &l5&rAnd God called the
    light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were
    the first day. &l6&rAnd God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
    waters, and let it'
  '3': 'divide the waters from the waters. &l7&rAnd God made the firmament and divided
    the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the
    firmament: and it was so. &l8&rAnd God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening
    and the'
  '4': 'morning were the second day. &l9&rAnd God said, Let the waters under the heaven
    be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
    &l10&rAnd God called the dry land Earth and the gathering together of the waters
    called he'
  '5': 'Seas: and God saw that it was good. &l11&rAnd God said, Let the earth bring
    forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
    kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. &l12&rAnd the earth
    brought forth'
  '6': 'grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit,
    whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. &l13&rAnd
    the evening and the morning were the third day. &l14&rAnd God said, Let there
    be lights in the'
  '7': 'firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for
    signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: &l15&rAnd let them be for lights
    in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. &l16&rAnd
    God made'
  '8': 'two great lights the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to
    rule the night: he made the stars also. &l17&rAnd God set them in the firmament
    of the heaven to give light upon the earth, &l18&rAnd to rule over the day and
    over the night, and'
  '9': 'to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. &l19&rAnd
    the evening and the morning were the fourth day. &l20&rAnd God said, Let the waters
    bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly
    above the'
  '10': 'earth in the open firmament of heaven. &l21&rAnd God created great whales,
    and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly,
    after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was
    good. &l22&rAnd God'
  '11': blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. &l23&rAnd the evening and the morning were the fifth day. &l24&rAnd God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his
  '12': 'kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind:
    and it was so. &l25&rAnd God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
    after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind:
    and God saw that it'
  '13': 'was good. &l26&rAnd God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
    and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
    air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing
    that creepeth upon'
  '14': 'the earth. &l27&rSo God created man in his own image, in the image of God
    created he him male and female created he them. &l28&rAnd God blessed them, and
    God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue
    it: and have'
  '15': dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. &l29&rAnd God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the
  '16': 'which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat. &l30&rAnd
    to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing
    that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green
    herb for meat: and'
  '17': it was so. &l31&rAnd God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
  '18': Chapter 2/nThus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. &l2&rAnd on the seventh day God ended the work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. &l3&rAnd God blessed the seventh day,
  '19': 'and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which
    God created and made. &l4&rThese are the generations of the heavens and of the
    earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and
    the heavens. &l5&rAnd'
  '20': 'every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the
    field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth,
    and there was not a man to till the ground. &l6&rBut there went up a mist from
    the earth, and'
  '21': watered the whole face of the ground. &l7&rAnd the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul. &l8&rAnd the LORD God planted a garden, eastward in Eden and there he put the
  '22': man whom he had formed. &l9&rAnd out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. &l10&rAnd a river went
  '23': 'out of Eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted, and became
    into four heads. &l11&rThe name of the first is Pison that is it which compasseth
    the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold &l12&rAnd the gold of that land
    is good: there is'
  '24': 'bdellium and the onyx stone. &l13&rAnd the name of the second river is Gihon:
    the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. &l14&rAnd the name
    of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria.
    And the fourth'
  '25': 'river is Euphrates. &l15&rAnd the LORD God took the man, and put him into
    the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. &l16&rAnd the LORD God commanded
    the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: &l17&rBut
    of the tree of the'
  '26': 'knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that
    thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. &l18&rAnd the LORD God said, It is
    not good that the man should be alone I will make him an help meet for him. &l19&rAnd
    out of the ground'
  '27': 'the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air and
    brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
    every living creature, that was the name thereof. &l20&rAnd Adam gave names to
    all cattle, and to'
  '28': 'the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was
    not found an help meet for him. &l21&rAnd the LORD God caused a deep sleep to
    fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
    instead thereof'
  '29': '&l22&rAnd the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman,
    and brought her unto the man. &l23&rAnd Adam said, This is now bone of my bones,
    and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
    Man. &l24&rTherefore'
  '30': 'shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife:
    and they shall be one flesh. &l25&rAnd they were both naked, the man and his wife,
    and were not ashamed.'
  '31': Chapter 3/nNow the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden? &l2&rAnd the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the
  '32': 'fruit of the trees of the garden: &l3&rBut of the fruit of the tree which
    is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither
    shall ye touch it, lest ye die. &l4&rAnd the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall
    not surely die:'
  '33': '&l5&rFor God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall
    be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. &l6&rAnd when the woman
    saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and
    a tree to be'
  '34': desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat. &l7&rAnd the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
  '35': 'themselves aprons. &l8&rAnd they heard the voice of the LORD God walking
    in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from
    the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. &l9&rAnd the LORD
    God called unto Adam,'
  '36': and said unto him, Where art thou? &l10&rAnd he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked and I hid myself. &l11&rAnd he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that
  '37': thou shouldest not eat? &l12&rAnd the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. &l13&rAnd the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and
  '38': 'I did eat. &l14&rAnd the LORD God said unto the serpant, Because thou hast
    done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field
    upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
    &l15&rAnd I will put'
  '39': enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. &l16&rUnto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and
  '40': 'thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. &l17&rAnd
    unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and
    hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat
    of it: cursed is the'
  '41': ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life &l18&rThorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field &l19&rIn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the
  '42': 'ground for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt
    thou return. &l20&rAnd Adam called his wife''s name Eve because she was the mother
    of all living. &l21&rUnto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats
    of skins, and'
  '43': 'clothed them. &l22&rAnd the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one
    of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also
    of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: &l23&rTherefore the LORD God
    sent him forth from'
  '44': the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. &l24&rSo he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
  '45': Chapter 4/nAnd Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD &l2&rAnd she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. &l3&rAnd in process of time
  '46': 'it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering
    unto the LORD. &l4&rAnd Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and
    of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: &l5&rBut
    unto Cain and to'
  '47': his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his counterance fell. &l6&rAnd the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy counterance fallen? &l7&rIf thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well,
  '48': 'sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt
    rule over him. &l8&rAnd Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,
    when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew
    him. &l9&rAnd the'
  '49': 'LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not:
    Am I my brother''s keeper? &l10&rAnd he said, What hast thou done? the voice of
    thy brother''s blood crieth unto me from the ground. &l11&rAnd now art thou cursed
    from the earth, which'
  '50': hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; &l12&rWhen thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

  '1': Chapter 4 Cont./n&l13&rAnd Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear. &l14&rBehold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the
  '2': earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. &l15&rAnd the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should
  '3': kill him. &l16&rAnd Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. &l17&rAnd Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch; and he builded a city, after the name of his son, Enoch. &l18&rAnd unto
  '4': 'Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael:
    and Methusael begat Lamech. &l19&rAnd Lamech took unto him two wives: the name
    of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. &l20&rAnd Adah bare Jabal:
    he was the father'
  '5': 'of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle. &l21&rAnd his brother''s
    name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. &l22&rAnd
    Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and
    iron: and'
  '6': the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah. &l23&rAnd Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. &l24&rIf Cain shall be avenged
  '7': 'sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. &l25&rAnd Adam knew his wife
    again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed
    me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. &l26&rAnd to Seth, to him also
    there was'
  '8': 'born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name
    of the LORD.'
  '9': Chapter 5/nThis is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; &l2&rMale and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. &l3&rAnd
  '10': 'Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness,
    after his image; and called his name Seth: &l4&rAnd the days of Adam after he
    had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: &l5&rAnd
    all the days'
  '11': 'that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. &l6&rAnd
    Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: &l7&rAnd Seth lived after
    he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: &l8&rAnd
    all the days of'
  '12': 'Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died. &l9&rAnd Enos lived
    ninety years, and begat Cainan: &l10&rAnd Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight
    hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: &l11&rAnd all the days
    of Enos were nine'
  '13': 'hundred and five years: and he died. &l12&rAnd Cainan lived seventy years,
    and begat Mahalaleel: &l13&rAnd Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred
    and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: &l14&rAnd all the days of Cainan
    were nine'
  '14': 'hundred and ten years: and he died. &l15&rAnd Mahalaleel lived sixty and
    five years, and begat Jared: &l16&rAnd Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight
    hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: &l17&rAnd all the days
    of Mahalaleel were'
  '15': 'eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died. &l18&rAnd Jared lived an
    hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: &l19&rAnd Jared lived after he
    begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: &l20&rAnd all the
    days of Jared were'
  '16': 'nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died. &l21&rAnd Enoch lived sixty
    and five years, and begat Methuselah: &l22&rAnd Enoch walked with God after he
    begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: &l23&rAnd
    all the days of Enoch'
  '17': 'were three hundred sixty and five years: &l24&rAnd Enoch walked with God:
    and he was not; for God took him. &l25&rAnd Methuselah lived an hundred eighty
    and seven years, and begat Lamech. &l26&rAnd Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech
    seven hundred'
  '18': 'eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: &l27&rAnd all the days
    of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years, and he died. &l28&rAnd Lamech
    lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: &l29&rAnd he called his
    name Noah,'
  '19': 'saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands,
    because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. &l30&rAnd Lamech lived after
    he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:
    &l31&rAnd all the'
  '20': 'days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died. &l32&rAnd
    Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.'
  '21': Chapter 6/nAnd it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, &l2&rThat the sons of God saw tha daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. &l3&rAnd the
  '22': 'LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is
    flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. &l4&rThere were giants
    in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in
    unto the daughters of'
  '23': men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. &l5&rAnd God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
  '24': '&l6&rAnd it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved
    him at his heart. &l7&rAnd the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created
    from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the
    fowls of the'
  '25': 'air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. &l8&rBut Noah found grace
    in the eyes of the LORD. &l9&rThese are the generations of Noah: Noah was just
    a man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. &l10&rAnd Noah
    begat three sons, Shem,'
  '26': Ham, and Japheth. &l11&rThe earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. &l12&rAnd God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. &l13&rAnd God said unto Noah, The
  '27': end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. &l14&rMake thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with
  '28': 'pitch. &l15&rAnd this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length
    of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and
    the height of it thirty cubits. &l16&rA window shalt thou make to the ark, and
    in a cubit shalt thou'
  '29': finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side therof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. &l17&rAnd, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of
  '30': life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die. &l18&rBut with thee will I establish my convenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. &l19&rAnd of every living thing
  '31': of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. &l20&rOf fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every
  '32': sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. &l21&rAnd take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. &l22&rThus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
  '33': he.
  '34': 'Chapter 7/nAnd the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into
    the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. &l2&rOf
    every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female:
    and of beasts that are not'
  '35': clean by two, the male and his female. &l3&rOf fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. &l4&rFor yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and
  '36': every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. &l5&rAnd Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. &l6&rAnd Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. &l7&rAnd Noah went
  '37': in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. &l8&rOf clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, &l9&rThere went in two
  '38': and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. &l10&rAnd it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. &l11&rIn the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
  '39': seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. &l12&rAnd the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. &l13&rIn the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and
  '40': Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; &l14&rThey, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
  '41': kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. &l15&rAnd they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life. &l16&rAnd they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded
  '42': 'him: and the LORD shut him in. &l17&rAnd the flood was forty days upon the
    earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above
    the earth. &l18&rAnd the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
    earth; and the ark went'
  '43': upon the face of the waters. &l19&rAnd the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. &l20&rFifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. &l21&rAnd
  '44': 'all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and
    of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every
    man: &l22&rAll in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the
    dry land, died.'
  '45': '&l23&rAnd every living subtance was destroyed which was upon the face of
    the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of heaven;
    and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they
    that were with him in'
  '46': the ark. &l24&rAnd the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
  '47': 'Chapter 8/nAnd God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle
    that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and
    the waters asswaged; &l2&rThe fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven
    were stopped,'
  '48': 'and the rain from heaven was restrained; &l3&rAnd the waters returned from
    off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the
    waters were abated. &l4&rAnd the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth
    day of the month,'
  '49': 'upon the mountains of Ararat. &l5&rAnd the waters decreased continually until

    of the mountains seen. &l6&rAnd it came to pass at the end of forty days, that
    Noah opened the'
  '50': 'window of the ark which he had made: &l7&rAnd he sent forth a raven, which
    went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. &l8&rAlso
    he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face
    of the ground;'

  '1': 'Chapter 8 Cont./n&l9&rBut the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot,
    and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the
    whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto
    him into the ark.'
  '2': '&l10&rAnd he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove
    out of the ark; &l11&rAnd the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in
    her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated
    from off the earth.'
  '3': '&l12&rAnd he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned
    not again unto him any more. &l13&rAnd it came to pass in the six hundredth and
    first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried
    up from off'
  '4': 'the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold,
    the face of the ground was dry. &l14&rAnd in the second month, on the seven and
    twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. &l15&rAnd God spake unto Noah,
    saying, &l16&rGo'
  '5': forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. &l17&rBring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that
  '6': 'they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon
    the earth. &l18&rAnd Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons''
    wives with him: &l19&rEvery beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever
    creepeth upon'
  '7': the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. &l20&rAnd Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. &l21&rAnd the Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the
  '8': Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. &l22&rWhile the earth remaineth, seedtime
  '9': and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
  '10': Chapter 9/nAnd God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. &l2&rAnd the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth
  '11': upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. &l3&rEvery moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. &l4&rBut flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood
  '12': thereof, shall ye not eat. &l5&rAnd surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. &l6&rWhoso sheddeth man's blood, by
  '13': 'man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. &l7&rAnd
    you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply
    therein. &l8&rAnd God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, &l9&rAnd
    I, behold, I'
  '14': establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; &l10&rAnd with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
  '15': '&l11&rAnd I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh
    be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be
    a flood to destroy the earth. &l12&rAnd God said, This is the token of the covenant
    which I make between'
  '16': 'me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
    &l13&rI do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant
    between me and the earth. &l14&rAnd it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud
    over the earth,'
  '17': 'that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: &l15&rAnd I will remember my covenant,
    which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters
    shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. &l16&rAnd the bow shall be
    in the cloud;'
  '18': and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. &l17&rAnd God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all
  '19': 'flesh that is upon the earth. &l18&rAnd the sons of Noah, that went forth
    of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
    &l19&rThese are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
    &l20&rAnd Noah began'
  '20': 'to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: &l21&rAnd he drank of the
    wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. &l22&rAnd Ham, the
    father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
    &l23&rAnd Shem'
  '21': and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. &l24&rAnd Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his
  '22': younger son had done unto him. &l25&rAnd he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. &l26&rAnd he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. &l27&rGod shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall
  '23': 'dwell in the tents of Shem; and "Canaan shall be his servant. &l28&rAnd Noah
    lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. &l29&rAnd all the days of
    Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.'
  '24': 'Chapter 10/nNow these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,
    and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. &l2&rThe sons of Japheth;
    Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. &l3&rAnd
    the sons of'
  '25': Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. &l4&rAnd the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. &l5&rBy these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
  '26': '&l6&rAnd the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. &l7&rAnd
    the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and
    the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. &l8&rAnd Cush begat Nimrod: he began to
    be a mighty one in the'
  '27': 'earth. &l9&rHe was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said,
    Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. &l10&rAnd the beginning of his
    kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. &l11&rOut
    of that land'
  '28': 'went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
    &l12&rAnd Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. &l13&rAnd
    Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, &l14&rAnd Pathrusim,
    and Casluhim, (out of'
  '29': whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. &l15&rAnd Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, &l16&rAnd the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, &l17&rAnd the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, &l18&rAnd the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the
  '30': 'Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
    &l19&rAnd the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar,
    unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even
    unto Lasha.'
  '31': '&l20&rThese are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues,
    in their countries, and in their nations. &l21&rUnto Shem also, the father of
    all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children
    born. &l22&rThe'
  '32': 'children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. &l23&rAnd
    the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. &l24&rAnd Arphaxad begat
    Salah; and Salah begat Eber. &l25&rAnd unto Eber were born two sons: the name
    of one was Peleg;'
  '33': for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. &l26&rAnd Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, &l27&rAnd Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, &l28&rAnd Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, &l29&rAnd Ophir, and
  '34': 'Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan. &l30&rAnd their dwelling
    was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. &l31&rThese are
    the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after
    their nations.'
  '35': ' &l32&rThese are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,
    in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the
    flood.'
  '36': Chapter 11/nAnd the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. &l2&rAnd it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. &l3&rAnd they said one to another, Go to, let us make
  '37': brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. &l4&rAnd they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the
  '38': 'face of the whole earth. &l5&rAnd the Lord came down to see the city and
    the tower, which the children of men builded. &l6&rAnd the Lord said, Behold,
    the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do:
    and now nothing will be'
  '39': 'restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. &l7&rGo to, let us
    go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another''s
    speech. &l8&rSo the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all
    the earth: and'
  '40': 'they left off to build the city. &l9&rTherefore is the name of it called
    Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and
    from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. &l10&rThese
    are the'
  '41': 'generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two
    years after the flood: &l11&rAnd Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred
    years, and begat sons and daughters. &l12&rAnd Arphaxad lived five and thirty
    years, and begat'
  '42': 'Salah: &l13&rAnd Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
    years, and begat sons and daughters. &l14&rAnd Salah lived thirty years, and begat
    Eber: &l15&rAnd Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years,
    and begat sons and'
  '43': 'daughters. &l16&rAnd Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: &l17&rAnd
    Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons
    and daughters. &l18&rAnd Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: &l19&rAnd Peleg
    lived after he'
  '44': 'begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. &l20&rAnd
    Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: &l21&rAnd Reu lived after he
    begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. &l22&rAnd
    Serug lived thirty'
  '45': 'years, and begat Nahor: &l23&rAnd Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred
    years, and begat sons and daughters. &l24&rAnd Nahor lived nine and twenty years,
    and begat Terah: &l25&rAnd Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen
    years, and'
  '46': 'begat sons and daughters. &l26&rAnd Terah lived seventy years, and begat
    Abram, Nahor, and Haran. &l27&rNow these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat
    Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. &l28&rAnd Haran died before his
    father Terah in the'
  '47': 'land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. &l29&rAnd Abram and Nahor took
    them wives: the name of Abram''s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor''s wife,
    Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
    &l30&rBut Sarai was'
  '48': barren; she had no child. &l31&rAnd Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came
  '49': 'unto Haran, and dwelt there. &l32&rAnd the days of Terah were two hundred
    and five years: and Terah died in Haran.'
  '50': 'Chapter 12/nNow the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
    and from thy kindred, and from thy father''s house, unto a land that I will shew

    will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and "in thee
    shall all families of the'
  '2': 'earth be blessed. &l4&rSo Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him;
    and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed
    out of Haran. &l5&rAnd Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother''s son,
    and all their substance'
  '3': that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. &l6&rAnd Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the
  '4': 'Canaanite was then in the land. &l7&rAnd the Lord appeared unto Abram, and
    said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto
    the Lord, who appeared unto him. &l8&rAnd he removed from thence unto a mountain
    on the east of Bethel,'
  '5': 'and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and
    there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
    &l9&rAnd Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. &l10&rAnd there was
    a famine in the land:'
  '6': 'and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous
    in the land. &l11&rAnd it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,
    that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman
    to look upon:'
  '7': '&l12&rTherefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee,
    that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save
    thee alive. &l13&rSay, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
    me for thy sake; and'
  '8': 'my soul shall live because of thee. &l14&rAnd it came to pass, that, when
    Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
    &l15&rThe princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and
    the woman was taken'
  '9': 'into Pharaoh''s house. &l16&rAnd he entreated Abram well for her sake: and
    he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she
    asses, and camels. &l17&rAnd the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great
    plagues because of'
  '10': 'Sarai Abram''s wife. &l18&rAnd Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this
    that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
    &l19&rWhy saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife:
    now therefore behold'
  '11': 'thy wife, take her, and go thy way. &l20&rAnd Pharaoh commanded his men concerning
    him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.'
  '12': Chapter 13/nAnd Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south. &l2&rAnd Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. &l3&rAnd he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the
  '13': 'place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; &l4&rUnto
    the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram
    called on the name of the Lord. &l5&rAnd Lot also, which went with Abram, had
    flocks, and herds,'
  '14': 'and tents. &l6&rAnd the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
    together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
    &l7&rAnd there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram''s cattle and the herdmen
    of Lot''s cattle:'
  '15': and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. &l8&rAnd Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. &l9&rIs not the whole land before thee?
  '16': 'separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand,
    then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will
    go to the left. &l10&rAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of
    Jordan, that it was well'
  '17': 'watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as
    the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. &l11&rThen
    Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated
    themselves the'
  '18': one from the other. &l12&rAbram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom. &l13&rBut the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly. &l14&rAnd the Lord said unto
  '19': 'Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and
    look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and
    westward: &l15&rFor all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and
    to thy seed for ever.'
  '20': '&l16&rAnd I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man
    can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. &l17&rArise,
    walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will
    give it unto thee.'
  '21': ' &l18&rThen Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre,
    which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.'
  '22': Chapter 14/nAnd it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations; &l2&rThat these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah,
  '23': and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. &l3&rAll these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. &l4&rTwelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. &l5&rAnd in the
  '24': fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, &l6&rAnd the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
  '25': ' &l7&rAnd they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote
    all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.
    &l8&rAnd there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king
    of Admah, and'
  '26': the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim; &l9&rWith Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four
  '27': kings with five. &l10&rAnd the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. &l11&rAnd they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and
  '28': went their way. &l12&rAnd they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. &l13&rAnd there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and
  '29': 'brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram. &l14&rAnd when Abram
    heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born
    in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan. &l15&rAnd
    he divided himself'
  '30': against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. &l16&rAnd he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the
  '31': people. &l17&rAnd the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale. &l18&rAnd Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread
  '32': 'and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. &l19&rAnd he blessed
    him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and
    earth: &l20&rAnd blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies
    into thy hand. And he'
  '33': gave him tithes of all. &l21&rAnd the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. &l22&rAnd Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and
  '34': 'earth, &l23&rThat I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
    that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have
    made Abram rich: &l24&rSave only that which the young men have eaten, and the
    portion of the men which'
  '35': went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
  '36': 'Chapter 15/nAfter these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a
    vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
    &l2&rAnd Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless,
    and the steward of my'
  '37': 'house is this Eliezer of Damascus? &l3&rAnd Abram said, Behold, to me thou
    hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. &l4&rAnd, behold,
    the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but
    he that shall come'
  '38': 'forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. &l5&rAnd he brought him
    forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be
    able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. &l6&rAnd he believed
    in the Lord; and'
  '39': he counted it to him for righteousness. &l7&rAnd he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. &l8&rAnd he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? &l9&rAnd he said
  '40': unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. &l10&rAnd he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against
  '41': 'another: but the birds divided he not. &l11&rAnd when the fowls came down
    upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. &l12&rAnd when the sun was going down,
    a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
    &l13&rAnd he said'
  '42': 'unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land
    that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred
    years; &l14&rAnd also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward
    shall they'
  '43': 'come out with great substance. &l15&rAnd thou shalt go to thy fathers in
    peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. &l16&rBut in the fourth generation
    they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
    &l17&rAnd it came to'
  '44': pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. &l18&rIn the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of
  '45': 'Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: &l19&rThe Kenites, and the
    Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, &l20&rAnd the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and
    the Rephaims, &l21&rAnd the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites,
    and the Jebusites.'
  '46': 'Chapter 16/nNow Sarai Abram''s wife bare him no children: and she had an
    handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. &l2&rAnd Sarai said unto Abram, Behold
    now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid;
    it may be that I may'
  '47': obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. &l3&rAnd Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. &l4&rAnd he went in
  '48': 'unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her
    mistress was despised in her eyes. &l5&rAnd Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be
    upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had
    conceived, I was'
  '49': 'despised in her eyes: the Lord judge between me and thee. &l6&rBut Abram
    said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee.
    And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. &l7&rAnd the angel
    of the Lord found'
  '50': her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. &l8&rAnd he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

  '1': Chapter 16 Cont./n&l9&rAnd the angel of the Lord said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. &l10&rAnd the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
  '2': '&l11&rAnd the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with child
    and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the Lord hath heard
    thy affliction. &l12&rAnd he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every
    man, and every'
  '3': 'man''s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
    &l13&rAnd she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest
    me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me? &l14&rWherefore
    the well was'
  '4': 'called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. &l15&rAnd Hagar
    bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son''s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.
    &l16&rAnd Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.'
  '5': Chapter 17/nAnd when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. &l2&rAnd I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
  '6': '&l3&rAnd Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, &l4&rAs
    for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
    &l5&rNeither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham;
    for a'
  '7': father of many nations have I made thee. &l6&rAnd I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. &l7&rAnd I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations
  '8': for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. &l8&rAnd I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their
  '9': God. &l9&rAnd God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. &l10&rThis is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be
  '10': circumcised. &l11&rAnd ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. &l12&rAnd he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in
  '11': 'the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.
    &l13&rHe that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must
    needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting
    covenant. &l14&rAnd'
  '12': the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant. &l15&rAnd God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall
  '13': 'her name be. &l16&rAnd I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her:
    yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall
    be of her. &l17&rThen Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
    heart, Shall a child'
  '14': be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? &l18&rAnd Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! &l19&rAnd God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his
  '15': 'name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting
    covenant, and with his seed after him. &l20&rAnd as for Ishmael, I have heard
    thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply
    him exceedingly; twelve'
  '16': princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. &l21&rBut my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. &l22&rAnd he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
  '17': '&l23&rAnd Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house,
    and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham''s
    house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God
    had said unto him.'
  '18': '&l24&rAnd Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised
    in the flesh of his foreskin. &l25&rAnd Ishmael his son was thirteen years old,
    when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. &l26&rIn the selfsame day
    was Abraham'
  '19': circumcised, and Ishmael his son. &l27&rAnd all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
  '20': 'Chapter 18/nAnd the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he
    sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; &l2&rAnd he lift up his eyes and
    looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet
    them from the tent door,'
  '21': 'and bowed himself toward the ground, &l3&rAnd said, My Lord, if now I have
    found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: &l4&rLet
    a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves
    under the tree:'
  '22': '&l5&rAnd I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after
    that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said,
    So do, as thou hast said. &l6&rAnd Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah,
    and said, Make ready'
  '23': quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. &l7&rAnd Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. &l8&rAnd he took butter, and milk, and the calf
  '24': which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. &l9&rAnd they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. &l10&rAnd he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to
  '25': the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. &l11&rNow Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. &l12&rTherefore
  '26': Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? &l13&rAnd the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? &l14&rIs any thing too hard
  '27': for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. &l15&rThen Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. &l16&rAnd the men rose up
  '28': 'from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring
    them on the way. &l17&rAnd the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing
    which I do; &l18&rSeeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation,
    and all the'
  '29': nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? &l19&rFor I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath
  '30': spoken of him. &l20&rAnd the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; &l21&rI will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if
  '31': 'not, I will know. &l22&rAnd the men turned their faces from thence, and went
    toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord. &l23&rAnd Abraham drew near,
    and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? &l24&rPeradventure
    there be fifty'
  '32': 'righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place
    for the fifty righteous that are therein? &l25&rThat be far from thee to do after
    this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should
    be as the wicked,'
  '33': 'that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? &l26&rAnd
    the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will
    spare all the place for their sakes. &l27&rAnd Abraham answered and said, Behold
    now, I have'
  '34': 'taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: &l28&rPeradventure
    there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for
    lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy
    it.'
  '35': '&l29&rAnd he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall
    be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty''s sake. &l30&rAnd
    he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure
    there shall thirty be'
  '36': 'found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. &l31&rAnd
    he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure
    there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty''s
    sake. &l32&rAnd'
  '37': 'he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once:
    Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for
    ten''s sake. &l33&rAnd the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing
    with Abraham: and Abraham'
  '38': returned unto his place.
  '39': 'Chapter 19/nAnd there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
    gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself
    with his face toward the ground; &l2&rAnd he said, Behold now, my lords, turn
    in, I pray you, into your'
  '40': servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. &l3&rAnd he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into
  '41': 'his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they
    did eat. &l4&rBut before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom,
    compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
    &l5&rAnd they'
  '42': called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. &l6&rAnd Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, &l7&rAnd said, I pray you, brethren, do not so
  '43': 'wickedly. &l8&rBehold now, I have two daughters which have not known man;
    let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your
    eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow
    of my roof. &l9&rAnd'
  '44': 'they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn,
    and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them.
    And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
    &l10&rBut the men'
  '45': 'put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to
    the door. &l11&rAnd they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
    blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
    &l12&rAnd the men'
  '46': 'said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and
    thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
    &l13&rFor we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before
    the face of the'
  '47': Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it. &l14&rAnd Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons
  '48': in law. &l15&rAnd when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. &l16&rAnd while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand,
  '49': 'and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the
    Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without
    the city. &l17&rAnd it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
    that he said, Escape for'
  '50': 'thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape
    to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. &l18&rAnd Lot said unto them, Oh, not
    so, my Lord:'

  '1': 'Chapter 19 Cont./n&l19&rBehold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight,
    and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my
    life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
    &l20&rBehold now,'
  '2': 'this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape
    thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. &l21&rAnd he said unto
    him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow
    this city, for'
  '3': the which thou hast spoken. &l22&rHaste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. &l23&rThe sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. &l24&rThen the Lord rained
  '4': upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven; &l25&rAnd he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. &l26&rBut his wife looked back from behind him,
  '5': 'and she became a pillar of salt. &l27&rAnd Abraham gat up early in the morning
    to the place where he stood before the Lord: &l28&rAnd he looked toward Sodom
    and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke
    of the country'
  '6': went up as the smoke of a furnace. &l29&rAnd it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. &l30&rAnd Lot went
  '7': 'up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him;
    for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
    &l31&rAnd the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is
    not a man in the'
  '8': 'earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: &l32&rCome, let
    us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve
    seed of our father. &l33&rAnd they made their father drink wine that night: and
    the firstborn went in,'
  '9': 'and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when
    she arose. &l34&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto
    the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine
    this night also;'
  '10': 'and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
    &l35&rAnd they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose,
    and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
    &l36&rThus were'
  '11': 'both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. &l37&rAnd the first
    born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites
    unto this day. &l38&rAnd the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
    Benammi: the same is'
  '12': the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
  '13': 'Chapter 20/nAnd Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and
    dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. &l2&rAnd Abraham said
    of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took
    Sarah. &l3&rBut God'
  '14': 'came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art
    but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man''s wife.
    &l4&rBut Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also
    a righteous nation?'
  '15': '&l5&rSaid he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said,
    He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have
    I done this. &l6&rAnd God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
    this in the integrity'
  '16': 'of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore
    suffered I thee not to touch her. &l7&rNow therefore restore the man his wife;
    for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou
    restore her not, know'
  '17': 'thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. &l8&rTherefore
    Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all
    these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. &l9&rThen Abimelech
    called Abraham, and'
  '18': said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. &l10&rAnd Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that
  '19': thou hast done this thing? &l11&rAnd Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. &l12&rAnd yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my
  '20': mother; and she became my wife. &l13&rAnd it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
  '21': '&l14&rAnd Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants,
    and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. &l15&rAnd Abimelech
    said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. &l16&rAnd
    unto Sarah he said,'
  '22': 'Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he
    is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:
    thus she was reproved. &l17&rSo Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech,
    and his wife,'
  '23': and his maidservants; and they bare children. &l18&rFor the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.
  '24': Chapter 21/nAnd the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken. &l2&rFor Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. &l3&rAnd Abraham called the name of his
  '25': son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. &l4&rAnd Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. &l5&rAnd Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. &l6&rAnd Sarah said, God
  '26': 'hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me. &l7&rAnd
    she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children
    suck? for I have born him a son in his old age. &l8&rAnd the child grew, and was
    weaned: and Abraham'
  '27': 'made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned. &l9&rAnd Sarah saw
    the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. &l10&rWherefore
    she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this
    bondwoman'
  '28': shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. &l11&rAnd the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. &l12&rAnd God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that
  '29': Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. &l13&rAnd also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed. &l14&rAnd Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle
  '30': 'of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child,
    and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
    &l15&rAnd the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one
    of the shrubs.'
  '31': '&l16&rAnd she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as
    it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she
    sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. &l17&rAnd God heard the
    voice of the lad; and'
  '32': the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. &l18&rArise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
  '33': '&l19&rAnd God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went,
    and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. &l20&rAnd God was with
    the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. &l21&rAnd
    he dwelt in the'
  '34': 'wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
    &l22&rAnd it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain
    of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
    &l23&rNow'
  '35': 'therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with
    me, nor with my son, nor with my son''s son: but according to the kindness that
    I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast
    sojourned. &l24&rAnd'
  '36': Abraham said, I will swear. &l25&rAnd Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. &l26&rAnd Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I
  '37': of it, but to day. &l27&rAnd Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. &l28&rAnd Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. &l29&rAnd Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe
  '38': lambs which thou hast set by themselves? &l30&rAnd he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. &l31&rWherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware
  '39': 'both of them. &l32&rThus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech
    rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the
    land of the Philistines. &l33&rAnd Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called
    there on the name'
  '40': of the Lord, the everlasting God. &l34&rAnd Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
  '41': 'Chapter 22/nAnd it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham,
    and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. &l2&rAnd he said,
    Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the
    land of Moriah;'
  '42': and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. &l3&rAnd Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt
  '43': offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. &l4&rThen on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. &l5&rAnd Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go
  '44': yonder and worship, and come again to you. &l6&rAnd Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. &l7&rAnd Isaac spake unto Abraham his
  '45': 'father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said,
    Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? &l8&rAnd
    Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so
    they went both of'
  '46': them together. &l9&rAnd they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. &l10&rAnd Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took
  '47': 'the knife to slay his son. &l11&rAnd the angel of the Lord called unto him
    out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. &l12&rAnd he
    said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for
    now I know that thou'
  '48': 'fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
    &l13&rAnd Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram
    caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered
    him up for a burnt'
  '49': 'offering in the stead of his son. &l14&rAnd Abraham called the name of that
    place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall
    be seen. &l15&rAnd the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the
    second time,'
  '50': '&l16&rAnd said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou
    hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:'

  '1': Chapter 22 Cont./n&l17&rThat in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; &l18&rAnd in thy seed shall
  '2': all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. &l19&rSo Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. &l20&rAnd it came to pass after these things, that it
  '3': was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; &l21&rHuz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, &l22&rAnd Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. &l23&rAnd Bethuel
  '4': 'begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham''s brother. &l24&rAnd
    his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash,
    and Maachah.'
  '5': 'Chapter 23/nAnd Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these
    were the years of the life of Sarah. &l2&rAnd Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same
    is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep
    for her. &l3&rAnd'
  '6': 'Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,
    &l4&rI am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace
    with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. &l5&rAnd the children of Heth
    answered'
  '7': 'Abraham, saying unto him, &l6&rHear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince
    among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold
    from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. &l7&rAnd Abraham
    stood up, and bowed'
  '8': himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. &l8&rAnd he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, &l9&rThat he may give me the
  '9': 'cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as
    much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace
    amongst you. &l10&rAnd Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the
    Hittite answered'
  '10': 'Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in
    at the gate of his city, saying, &l11&rNay, my lord, hear me: the field give I
    thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons
    of my people give I it'
  '11': 'thee: bury thy dead. &l12&rAnd Abraham bowed down himself before the people
    of the land. &l13&rAnd he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
    land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee
    money for the field;'
  '12': 'take it of me, and I will bury my dead there. &l14&rAnd Ephron answered Abraham,
    saying unto him, &l15&rMy lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred
    shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
    &l16&rAnd Abraham'
  '13': hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. &l17&rAnd the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before
  '14': Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure &l18&rUnto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the
  '15': 'gate of his city. &l19&rAnd after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in
    the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land
    of Canaan. &l20&rAnd the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto
    Abraham for a'
  '16': possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.
  '17': 'Chapter 24/nAnd Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the Lord had
    blessed Abraham in all things. &l2&rAnd Abraham said unto his eldest servant of
    his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my
    thigh: &l3&rAnd I'
  '18': 'will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth,
    that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites,
    among whom I dwell: &l4&rBut thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred,
    and take a wife'
  '19': 'unto my son Isaac. &l5&rAnd the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman
    will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again
    unto the land from whence thou camest? &l6&rAnd Abraham said unto him, Beware
    thou that thou'
  '20': bring not my son thither again. &l7&rThe Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before
  '21': 'thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. &l8&rAnd if the
    woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my
    oath: only bring not my son thither again. &l9&rAnd the servant put his hand under
    the thigh of'
  '22': 'Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. &l10&rAnd the
    servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the
    goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto
    the city of Nahor.'
  '23': '&l11&rAnd he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of
    water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.
    &l12&rAnd he said O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed
    this day, and shew'
  '24': 'kindness unto my master Abraham. &l13&rBehold, I stand here by the well of
    water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: &l14&rAnd
    let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher,
    I pray thee, that I'
  '25': 'may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also:
    let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby
    shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. &l15&rAnd it came
    to pass, before he had'
  '26': 'done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son
    of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham''s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
    &l16&rAnd the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man
    known her: and'
  '27': 'she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up. &l17&rAnd
    the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water
    of thy pitcher. &l18&rAnd she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down
    her pitcher upon her'
  '28': hand, and gave him drink. &l19&rAnd when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. &l20&rAnd she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw
  '29': water, and drew for all his camels. &l21&rAnd the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not. &l22&rAnd it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a
  '30': 'shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;
    &l23&rAnd said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in
    thy father''s house for us to lodge in? &l24&rAnd she said unto him, I am the
    daughter of Bethuel'
  '31': the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. &l25&rShe said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. &l26&rAnd the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the Lord. &l27&rAnd he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my
  '32': 'master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his
    truth: I being in the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master''s brethren.
    &l28&rAnd the damsel ran, and told them of her mother''s house these things. &l29&rAnd
    Rebekah had a'
  '33': 'brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the
    well. &l30&rAnd it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his
    sister''s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus
    spake the man unto me;'
  '34': that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. &l31&rAnd he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels. &l32&rAnd the man came into the
  '35': 'house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels,
    and water to wash his feet, and the men''s feet that were with him. &l33&rAnd
    there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have
    told mine errand.'
  '36': 'And he said, Speak on. &l34&rAnd he said, I am Abraham''s servant. &l35&rAnd
    the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given
    him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants,
    and camels, and'
  '37': 'asses. &l36&rAnd Sarah my master''s wife bare a son to my master when she
    was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. &l37&rAnd my master made
    me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the
    Canaanites, in whose land'
  '38': 'I dwell: &l38&rBut thou shalt go unto my father''s house, and to my kindred,
    and take a wife unto my son. &l39&rAnd I said unto my master, Peradventure the
    woman will not follow me. &l40&rAnd he said unto me, The Lord, before whom I walk,
    will send his'
  '39': 'angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son
    of my kindred, and of my father''s house: &l41&rThen shalt thou be clear from
    this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou
    shalt be clear from'
  '40': 'my oath. &l42&rAnd I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord God of
    my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: &l43&rBehold, I stand
    by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth
    to draw water,'
  '41': 'and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to
    drink; &l44&rAnd she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy
    camels: let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my master''s
    son. &l45&rAnd before'
  '42': 'I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher
    on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto
    her, Let me drink, I pray thee. &l46&rAnd she made haste, and let down her pitcher
    from her'
  '43': 'shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank,
    and she made the camels drink also. &l47&rAnd I asked her, and said, Whose daughter
    art thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor''s son, whom Milcah bare
    unto him: and I'
  '44': put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. &l48&rAnd I bowed down my head, and worshipped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.
  '45': '&l49&rAnd now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and
    if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. &l50&rThen
    Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the Lord: we cannot
    speak unto thee'
  '46': bad or good. &l51&rBehold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the Lord hath spoken. &l52&rAnd it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the Lord, bowing himself to the
  '47': 'earth. &l53&rAnd the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of
    gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to
    her mother precious things. &l54&rAnd they did eat and drink, he and the men that
    were with him, and'
  '48': tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. &l55&rAnd her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. &l56&rAnd he said unto them, Hinder
  '49': me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. &l57&rAnd they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. &l58&rAnd they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I
  '50': will go. &l59&rAnd they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.

  '1': Chapter 24 Cont./n&l60&rAnd they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. &l61&rAnd Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon
  '2': 'the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his
    way. &l62&rAnd Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the
    south country. &l63&rAnd Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:
    and he lifted up'
  '3': his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming. &l64&rAnd Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. &l65&rFor she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant
  '4': 'had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.
    &l66&rAnd the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. &l67&rAnd Isaac
    brought her into his mother Sarah''s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his
    wife; and he loved her:'
  '5': and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
  '6': Chapter 25/nThen again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. &l2&rAnd she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. &l3&rAnd Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and
  '7': Leummim. &l4&rAnd the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. &l5&rAnd Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. &l6&rBut unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave
  '8': gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. &l7&rAnd these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. &l8&rThen Abraham gave up the ghost, and
  '9': died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. &l9&rAnd his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; &l10&rThe field
  '10': 'which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and
    Sarah his wife. &l11&rAnd it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God
    blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. &l12&rNow these are
    the generations of'
  '11': 'Ishmael, Abraham''s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah''s handmaid, bare
    unto Abraham: &l13&rAnd these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names,
    according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar,
    and Adbeel, and'
  '12': 'Mibsam, &l14&rAnd Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, &l15&rHadar, and Tema, Jetur,
    Naphish, and Kedemah: &l16&rThese are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their
    names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their
    nations. &l17&rAnd'
  '13': 'these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven
    years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. &l18&rAnd
    they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward
    Assyria: and he'
  '14': 'died in the presence of all his brethren. &l19&rAnd these are the generations
    of Isaac, Abraham''s son: Abraham begat Isaac: &l20&rAnd Isaac was forty years
    old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram,
    the sister to'
  '15': 'Laban the Syrian. &l21&rAnd Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife, because
    she was barren: and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
    &l22&rAnd the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so,
    why am I thus?'
  '16': And she went to enquire of the Lord. &l23&rAnd the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the
  '17': younger. &l24&rAnd when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. &l25&rAnd the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. &l26&rAnd after that came his brother out, and his hand
  '18': 'took hold on Esau''s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore
    years old when she bare them. &l27&rAnd the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning
    hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. &l28&rAnd
    Isaac loved'
  '19': 'Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. &l29&rAnd
    Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: &l30&rAnd Esau
    said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint:
    therefore was his'
  '20': 'name called Edom. &l31&rAnd Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
    &l32&rAnd Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this
    birthright do to me? &l33&rAnd Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware
    unto him: and he sold'
  '21': 'his birthright unto Jacob. &l34&rThen Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of
    lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised
    his birthright.'
  '22': Chapter 26/nAnd there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. &l2&rAnd the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the
  '23': 'land which I shall tell thee of: &l3&rSojourn in this land, and I will be
    with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give
    all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy
    father; &l4&rAnd I will'
  '24': make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; &l5&rBecause that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes,
  '25': 'and my laws. &l6&rAnd Isaac dwelt in Gerar: &l7&rAnd the men of the place
    asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She
    is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because
    she was fair to'
  '26': look upon. &l8&rAnd it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. &l9&rAnd Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a
  '27': surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. &l10&rAnd Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou
  '28': 'shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. &l11&rAnd Abimelech charged all
    his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put
    to death. &l12&rThen Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an
    hundredfold: and the'
  '29': 'Lord blessed him. &l13&rAnd the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew
    until he became very great: &l14&rFor he had possession of flocks, and possession
    of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. &l15&rFor
    all the wells'
  '30': which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. &l16&rAnd Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. &l17&rAnd Isaac departed thence,
  '31': 'and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. &l18&rAnd Isaac
    digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham
    his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and
    he called their'
  '32': 'names after the names by which his father had called them. &l19&rAnd Isaac''s
    servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. &l20&rAnd
    the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac''s herdmen, saying, The water is ours:
    and he called'
  '33': 'the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. &l21&rAnd they digged
    another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. &l22&rAnd
    he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not:
    and he'
  '34': called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. &l23&rAnd he went up from thence to Beersheba. &l24&rAnd the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham
  '35': 'thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply
    thy seed for my servant Abraham''s sake. &l25&rAnd he builded an altar there,
    and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac''s
    servants digged a'
  '36': well. &l26&rThen Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. &l27&rAnd Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? &l28&rAnd they said,
  '37': 'We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee: and we said, Let there be now
    an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with
    thee; &l29&rThat thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as
    we have done unto thee'
  '38': 'nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed
    of the Lord. &l30&rAnd he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. &l31&rAnd
    they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent
    them away, and'
  '39': 'they departed from him in peace. &l32&rAnd it came to pass the same day,
    that Isaac''s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged,
    and said unto him, We have found water. &l33&rAnd he called it Shebah: therefore
    the name of the'
  '40': 'city is Beersheba unto this day. &l34&rAnd Esau was forty years old when
    he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter
    of Elon the Hittite: &l35&rWhich were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.'
  '41': 'Chapter 27/nAnd it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were
    dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him,
    My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. &l2&rAnd he said, Behold now,
    I am old, I know not'
  '42': 'the day of my death: &l3&rNow therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy
    quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; &l4&rAnd
    make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that
    my soul may bless'
  '43': thee before I die. &l5&rAnd Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. &l6&rAnd Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
  '44': '&l7&rBring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless
    thee before the Lord before my death. &l8&rNow therefore, my son, obey my voice
    according to that which I command thee. &l9&rGo now to the flock, and fetch me
    from thence two good'
  '45': 'kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such
    as he loveth: &l10&rAnd thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and
    that he may bless thee before his death. &l11&rAnd Jacob said to Rebekah his mother,
    Behold, Esau my'
  '46': 'brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: &l12&rMy father peradventure
    will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse
    upon me, and not a blessing. &l13&rAnd his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy
    curse, my son: only'
  '47': 'obey my voice, and go fetch me them. &l14&rAnd he went, and fetched, and
    brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father
    loved. &l15&rAnd Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were
    with her in the house,'
  '48': 'and put them upon Jacob her younger son: &l16&rAnd she put the skins of the
    kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: &l17&rAnd she
    gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of
    her son Jacob.'
  '49': '&l18&rAnd he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here
    am I; who art thou, my son? &l19&rAnd Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy
    first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and
    eat of my venison,'
  '50': that thy soul may bless me. &l20&rAnd Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord thy God brought it to me.

  '1': Chapter 27 Cont./n&l21&rAnd Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not. &l22&rAnd Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but
  '2': 'the hands are the hands of Esau. &l23&rAnd he discerned him not, because his
    hands were hairy, as his brother Esau''s hands: so he blessed him. &l24&rAnd he
    said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. &l25&rAnd he said, Bring it
    near to me, and I'
  '3': 'will eat of my son''s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought
    it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank. &l26&rAnd
    his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. &l27&rAnd
    he came near, and kissed'
  '4': 'him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See,
    the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed: &l28&rTherefore
    God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of
    corn'
  '5': 'and wine: &l29&rLet people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord
    over thy brethren, and let thy mother''s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every
    one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee. &l30&rAnd it came
    to pass, as soon as'
  '6': Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. &l31&rAnd he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his
  '7': father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. &l32&rAnd Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau. &l33&rAnd Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is
  '8': he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed. &l34&rAnd when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto
  '9': 'his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father. &l35&rAnd he said, Thy brother
    came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. &l36&rAnd he said, Is not
    he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away
    my birthright;'
  '10': and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? &l37&rAnd Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and
  '11': 'wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? &l38&rAnd
    Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even
    me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. &l39&rAnd Isaac
    his father'
  '12': answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; &l40&rAnd by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that
  '13': 'thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck. &l41&rAnd Esau hated Jacob because
    of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart,
    The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
    &l42&rAnd these'
  '14': 'words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called
    Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching
    thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee. &l43&rNow therefore, my son,
    obey my voice; arise,'
  '15': 'flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; &l44&rAnd tarry with him a few days,
    until thy brother''s fury turn away; &l45&rUntil thy brother''s anger turn away
    from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and
    fetch thee from'
  '16': 'thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? &l46&rAnd Rebekah
    said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob
    take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters
    of the land, what'
  '17': good shall my life do me?
  '18': Chapter 28/nAnd Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. &l2&rArise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of
  '19': the daughers of Laban thy mother's brother. &l3&rAnd God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; &l4&rAnd give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou
  '20': 'mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto
    Abraham. &l5&rAnd Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,
    son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob''s and Esau''s mother.
    &l6&rWhen Esau saw that'
  '21': Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan; &l7&rAnd that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother,
  '22': and was gone to Padanaram; &l8&rAnd Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; &l9&rThen went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be
  '23': his wife. &l10&rAnd Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. &l11&rAnd he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down
  '24': 'in that place to sleep. &l12&rAnd he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up
    on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God
    ascending and descending on it. &l13&rAnd, behold, the Lord stood above it, and
    said, I am the Lord God'
  '25': 'of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest,
    to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; &l14&rAnd thy seed shall be as the dust
    of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to
    the north, and to the'
  '26': 'south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be
    blessed. &l15&rAnd, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither
    thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee,
    until I have'
  '27': done that which I have spoken to thee of. &l16&rAnd Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. &l17&rAnd he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and
  '28': 'this is the gate of heaven. &l18&rAnd Jacob rose up early in the morning,
    and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar,
    and poured oil upon the top of it. &l19&rAnd he called the name of that place
    Bethel: but the name of'
  '29': that city was called Luz at the first. &l20&rAnd Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, &l21&rSo that I come again to my father's house in peace; then
  '30': 'shall the Lord be my God: &l22&rAnd this stone, which I have set for a pillar,
    shall be God''s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the
    tenth unto thee.'
  '31': 'Chapter 29/nThen Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
    people of the east. &l2&rAnd he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo,
    there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered
    the flocks: and a'
  '32': 'great stone was upon the well''s mouth. &l3&rAnd thither were all the flocks
    gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well''s mouth, and watered the sheep,
    and put the stone again upon the well''s mouth in his place. &l4&rAnd Jacob said
    unto them, My'
  '33': 'brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we. &l5&rAnd he said
    unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. &l6&rAnd
    he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel
    his daughter cometh with'
  '34': 'the sheep. &l7&rAnd he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that
    the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
    &l8&rAnd they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and
    till they roll the'
  '35': stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep. &l9&rAnd while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them. &l10&rAnd it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep
  '36': of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. &l11&rAnd Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. &l12&rAnd Jacob told Rachel that he was
  '37': 'her father''s brother, and that he was Rebekah''s son: and she ran and told
    her father. &l13&rAnd it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
    sister''s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and
    brought him to his'
  '38': house. And he told Laban all these things. &l14&rAnd Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. &l15&rAnd Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for
  '39': 'nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be? &l16&rAnd Laban had two daughters:
    the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. &l17&rLeah
    was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. &l18&rAnd Jacob loved
    Rachel; and'
  '40': 'said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. &l19&rAnd
    Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her
    to another man: abide with me. &l20&rAnd Jacob served seven years for Rachel;
    and they seemed unto'
  '41': him but a few days, for the love he had to her. &l21&rAnd Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. &l22&rAnd Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. &l23&rAnd it came to pass
  '42': 'in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and
    he went in unto her. &l24&rAnd Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid
    for an handmaid. &l25&rAnd it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was
    Leah: and he said'
  '43': to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? &l26&rAnd Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. &l27&rFulfil her week, and we
  '44': 'will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet
    seven other years. &l28&rAnd Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave
    him Rachel his daughter to wife also. &l29&rAnd Laban gave to Rachel his daughter
    Bilhah his handmaid'
  '45': 'to be her maid. &l30&rAnd he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also
    Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. &l31&rAnd when
    the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren. &l32&rAnd
    Leah conceived,'
  '46': 'and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the
    Lord hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me. &l33&rAnd
    she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the Lord hath heard I was
    hated, he hath'
  '47': 'therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon. &l34&rAnd
    she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be
    joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called
    Levi. &l35&rAnd'
  '48': 'she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the
    Lord: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.'
  '49': 'Chapter 30/nAnd when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied
    her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. &l2&rAnd Jacob''s
    anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God''s stead, who hath
    withheld from'
  '50': 'thee the fruit of the womb? &l3&rAnd she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go
    in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by
    her. &l4&rAnd she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto
    her.'

    for I have learned'
  '11': by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake. &l28&rAnd he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it. &l29&rAnd he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me. &l30&rFor it was little which thou hadst
  '12': 'before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the Lord hath
    blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house
    also? &l31&rAnd he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not
    give me any thing: if'
  '13': thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock. &l32&rI will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the
  '14': 'goats: and of such shall be my hire. &l33&rSo shall my righteousness answer
    for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every
    one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep,
    that shall be counted'
  '15': stolen with me. &l34&rAnd Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. &l35&rAnd he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white
  '16': 'in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of
    his sons. &l36&rAnd he set three days'' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and
    Jacob fed the rest of Laban''s flocks. &l37&rAnd Jacob took him rods of green
    poplar, and of the hazel and'
  '17': chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. &l38&rAnd he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive
  '18': when they came to drink. &l39&rAnd the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. &l40&rAnd Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the
  '19': flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. &l41&rAnd it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might
  '20': 'conceive among the rods. &l42&rBut when the cattle were feeble, he put them
    not in: so the feebler were Laban''s, and the stronger Jacob''s. &l43&rAnd the
    man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants,
    and camels, and'
  '21': asses.
  '22': Chapter 31/nAnd he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory. &l2&rAnd Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward
  '23': him as before. &l3&rAnd the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. &l4&rAnd Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, &l5&rAnd said unto them, I see your father's
  '24': countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me. &l6&rAnd ye know that with all my power I have served your father. &l7&rAnd your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not
  '25': 'to hurt me. &l8&rIf he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all
    the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire;
    then bare all the cattle ringstraked. &l9&rThus God hath taken away the cattle
    of your father, and'
  '26': given them to me. &l10&rAnd it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. &l11&rAnd the angel of God spake
  '27': 'unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I. &l12&rAnd he said,
    Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked,
    speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. &l13&rI
    am the God'

    unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy

    portion or'
  '29': 'inheritance for us in our father''s house? &l15&rAre we not counted of him
    strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. &l16&rFor
    all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children''s:

  '30': whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do. &l17&rThen Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; &l18&rAnd he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for
  '31': 'to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. &l19&rAnd Laban went to
    shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father''s. &l20&rAnd
    Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he
    fled. &l21&rSo he'
  '32': fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. &l22&rAnd it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. &l23&rAnd he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days'
  '33': journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. &l24&rAnd God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. &l25&rThen Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in
  '34': 'the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. &l26&rAnd
    Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares
    to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? &l27&rWherefore
    didst'
  '35': thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? &l28&rAnd hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly
  '36': 'in so doing. &l29&rIt is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the
    God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou
    speak not to Jacob either good or bad. &l30&rAnd now, though thou wouldest needs
    be gone, because thou'
  '37': 'sore longedst after thy father''s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my
    gods? &l31&rAnd Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I
    said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. &l32&rWith
    whomsoever thou findest'
  '38': 'thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine
    with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
    &l33&rAnd Laban went into Jacob''s tent, and into Leah''s tent, and into the two
    maidservants'' tents; but'
  '39': he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. &l34&rNow Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not. &l35&rAnd she said to
  '40': 'her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee;
    for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.
    &l36&rAnd Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to
    Laban, What is my'
  '41': trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? &l37&rWhereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
  '42': '&l38&rThis twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats
    have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. &l39&rThat
    which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my
    hand didst thou'
  '43': require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. &l40&rThus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. &l41&rThus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for
  '44': 'thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my
    wages ten times. &l42&rExcept the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the
    fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God
    hath seen mine'
  '45': 'affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight. &l43&rAnd
    Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these
    children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest
    is mine: and'
  '46': what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born? &l44&rNow therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee. &l45&rAnd Jacob took a stone, and set it up for
  '47': 'a pillar. &l46&rAnd Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they
    took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. &l47&rAnd
    Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. &l48&rAnd Laban said,
    This heap is a'
  '48': witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; &l49&rAnd Mizpah; for he said, The Lord watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. &l50&rIf thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other
  '49': 'wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt
    me and thee. &l51&rAnd Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
    pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: &l52&rThis heap be witness, and
    this pillar be witness,'
  '50': that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

    when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God''s host: and he called the name of that
    place Mahanaim. &l3&rAnd Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother
    unto the land of'
  '4': 'Seir, the country of Edom. &l4&rAnd he commanded them, saying, Thus shall
    ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with
    Laban, and stayed there until now: &l5&rAnd I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and
    menservants, and'

    sight. &l6&rAnd the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother
    Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. &l7&rThen
    Jacob was greatly'
  '6': 'afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the
    flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; &l8&rAnd said, If Esau come
    to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
    &l9&rAnd Jacob'
  '7': 'said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which
    saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well
    with thee: &l10&rI am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the
    truth, which'
  '8': 'thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;
    and now I am become two bands. &l11&rDeliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of
    my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite
    me, and the mother'
  '9': with the children. &l12&rAnd thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. &l13&rAnd he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau
  '10': his brother; &l14&rTwo hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, &l15&rThirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. &l16&rAnd he delivered them into the hand of his
  '11': servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. &l17&rAnd he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and
  '12': 'whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? &l18&rThen thou shalt
    say, They be thy servant Jacob''s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and,
    behold, also he is behind us. &l19&rAnd so commanded he the second, and the third,
    and all that'
  '13': followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. &l20&rAnd say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his
  '14': 'face; peradventure he will accept of me. &l21&rSo went the present over before
    him: and himself lodged that night in the company. &l22&rAnd he rose up that night,
    and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed
    over the'
  '15': ford Jabbok. &l23&rAnd he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. &l24&rAnd Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. &l25&rAnd when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he
  '16': touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. &l26&rAnd he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. &l27&rAnd he said unto him, What is
  '17': 'thy name? And he said, Jacob. &l28&rAnd he said, Thy name shall be called
    no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,
    and hast prevailed. &l29&rAnd Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee,
    thy name. And he'
  '18': 'said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him
    there. &l30&rAnd Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God
    face to face, and my life is preserved. &l31&rAnd as he passed over Penuel the
    sun rose upon him, and'
  '19': 'he halted upon his thigh. &l32&rTherefore the children of Israel eat not
    of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:
    because he touched the hollow of Jacob''s thigh in the sinew that shrank.'
  '20': Chapter 33/nAnd Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. &l2&rAnd he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and
  '21': Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. &l3&rAnd he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. &l4&rAnd Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and
  '22': 'kissed him: and they wept. &l5&rAnd he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women
    and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children
    which God hath graciously given thy servant. &l6&rThen the handmaidens came near,
    they and their'
  '23': 'children, and they bowed themselves. &l7&rAnd Leah also with her children
    came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they
    bowed themselves. &l8&rAnd he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which
    I met? And he said,'
  '24': 'These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. &l9&rAnd Esau said, I have
    enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. &l10&rAnd Jacob said, Nay,
    I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at
    my hand: for'
  '25': therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. &l11&rTake, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and
  '26': 'he took it. &l12&rAnd he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and
    I will go before thee. &l13&rAnd he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children
    are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should
    overdrive them'
  '27': 'one day, all the flock will die. &l14&rLet my lord, I pray thee, pass over
    before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth
    before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
    &l15&rAnd Esau'
  '28': said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. &l16&rSo Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. &l17&rAnd Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house,
  '29': 'and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called
    Succoth. &l18&rAnd Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land
    of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.
    &l19&rAnd he bought a'
  '30': parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. &l20&rAnd he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.
  '31': Chapter 34/nAnd Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. &l2&rAnd when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. &l3&rAnd
  '32': 'his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel,
    and spake kindly unto the damsel. &l4&rAnd Shechem spake unto his father Hamor,
    saying, Get me this damsel to wife. &l5&rAnd Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah
    his daughter: now'
  '33': 'his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until
    they were come. &l6&rAnd Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
    with him. &l7&rAnd the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:
    and the men were'
  '34': 'grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel
    in lying with Jacob''s daughter: which thing ought not to be done. &l8&rAnd Hamor
    communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter:
    I pray you give her'
  '35': 'him to wife. &l9&rAnd make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters
    unto us, and take our daughters unto you. &l10&rAnd ye shall dwell with us: and
    the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions
    therein. &l11&rAnd'
  '36': 'Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in
    your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. &l12&rAsk me never so much
    dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me
    the damsel to wife.'
  '37': '&l13&rAnd the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully,
    and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: &l14&rAnd they said unto
    them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised;
    for that were a'
  '38': 'reproach unto us: &l15&rBut in this will we consent unto you: If ye will
    be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised; &l16&rThen will we give our
    daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with
    you, and we will'
  '39': become one people. &l17&rBut if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. &l18&rAnd their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. &l19&rAnd the young man deferred not to do the thing, because
  '40': 'he had delight in Jacob''s daughter: and he was more honourable than all
    the house of his father. &l20&rAnd Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate
    of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, &l21&rThese men
    are peaceable with us;'
  '41': therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. &l22&rOnly herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with
  '42': us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. &l23&rShall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. &l24&rAnd unto Hamor and
  '43': unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. &l25&rAnd it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and
  '44': Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. &l26&rAnd they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. &l27&rThe sons of Jacob
  '45': came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. &l28&rThey took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, &l29&rAnd all their wealth, and all their
  '46': 'little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that
    was in the house. &l30&rAnd Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me
    to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and
    the Perizzites: and I'
  '47': being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. &l31&rAnd they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
  '48': 'Chapter 35/nAnd God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:
    and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from
    the face of Esau thy brother. &l2&rThen Jacob said unto his household, and to
    all that were with'
  '49': 'him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change
    your garments: &l3&rAnd let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there
    an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me
    in the way which I'
  '50': went. &l4&rAnd they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

    the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons
    of Jacob. &l6&rSo Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
    Bethel, he and all the'
  '2': 'people that were with him. &l7&rAnd he built there an altar, and called the

    God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. &l14&rAnd Jacob set
    up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and
    he poured a drink'
  '6': 'offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. &l15&rAnd Jacob called the name
    of the place where God spake with him, Bethel. &l16&rAnd they journeyed from Bethel;
    and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she
    had hard'

    said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. &l18&rAnd it came to pass,
    as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni:
    but his father'
  '8': 'called him Benjamin. &l19&rAnd Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath,
    which is Bethlehem. &l20&rAnd Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar
    of Rachel''s grave unto this day. &l21&rAnd Israel journeyed, and spread his tent
    beyond'
  '9': 'the tower of Edar. &l22&rAnd it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land,
    that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father''s concubine: and Israel heard
    it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: &l23&rThe sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob''s
    firstborn, and'
  '10': 'Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: &l24&rThe sons of

  '12': 'gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old
    and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.'
  '13': Chapter 36/nNow these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. &l2&rEsau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; &l3&rAnd Bashemath Ishmael's
  '14': 'daughter, sister of Nebajoth. &l4&rAnd Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath
    bare Reuel; &l5&rAnd Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the
    sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan. &l6&rAnd Esau took
    his wives, and'
  '15': his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. &l7&rFor their riches were more
  '16': 'than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers
    could not bear them because of their cattle. &l8&rThus dwelt Esau in mount Seir:

  '23': of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. &l22&rAnd the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. &l23&rAnd the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. &l24&rAnd these are
  '24': 'the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found
    the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father. &l25&rAnd
    the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
    &l26&rAnd these are'
  '25': the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran. &l27&rThe children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan. &l28&rThe children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran. &l29&rThese are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan,

    these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.
    &l31&rAnd these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned
    any king over'
  '27': 'the children of Israel. &l32&rAnd Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and
    the name of his city was Dinhabah. &l33&rAnd Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah
    of Bozrah reigned in his stead. &l34&rAnd Jobab died, and Husham of the land of
    Temani reigned in'
  '28': 'his stead. &l35&rAnd Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian
    in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.
    &l36&rAnd Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. &l37&rAnd Samlah
    died, and'
  '29': 'Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead. &l38&rAnd Saul died,
    and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. &l39&rAnd Baalhanan the
    son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was
    Pau; and his wife''s name'
  '30': was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab. &l40&rAnd these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, &l41&rDuke Aholibamah,
  '31': 'duke Elah, duke Pinon, &l42&rDuke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, &l43&rDuke
    Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations
    in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.'
  '32': Chapter 37/nAnd Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. &l2&rThese are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah,
  '33': 'and with the sons of Zilpah, his father''s wives: and Joseph brought unto
    his father their evil report. &l3&rNow Israel loved Joseph more than all his children,
    because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.
    &l4&rAnd when his'
  '34': 'brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they
    hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. &l5&rAnd Joseph dreamed a dream,
    and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. &l6&rAnd he said
    unto them, Hear, I'
  '35': 'pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: &l7&rFor, behold, we were binding
    sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold,
    your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. &l8&rAnd his brethren
    said to'
  '36': him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. &l9&rAnd he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream
  '37': 'more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance
    to me. &l10&rAnd he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father
    rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall
    I and thy mother and'
  '38': thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? &l11&rAnd his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. &l12&rAnd his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. &l13&rAnd Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy
  '39': brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. &l14&rAnd he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him
  '40': 'out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. &l15&rAnd a certain man
    found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him,
    saying, What seekest thou? &l16&rAnd he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray
    thee, where they feed'
  '41': their flocks. &l17&rAnd the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. &l18&rAnd when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired
  '42': 'against him to slay him. &l19&rAnd they said one to another, Behold, this
    dreamer cometh. &l20&rCome now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into
    some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see
    what will become of'
  '43': his dreams. &l21&rAnd Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. &l22&rAnd Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid
  '44': him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. &l23&rAnd it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; &l24&rAnd they took him, and cast him into a
  '45': 'pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. &l25&rAnd they sat
    down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company
    of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and
    myrrh, going to'
  '46': carry it down to Egypt. &l26&rAnd Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? &l27&rCome, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And
  '47': 'his brethren were content. &l28&rThen there passed by Midianites merchantmen;
    and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites
    for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. &l29&rAnd Reuben
    returned'
  '48': unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. &l30&rAnd he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? &l31&rAnd they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the
  '49': 'coat in the blood; &l32&rAnd they sent the coat of many colours, and they
    brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it
    be thy son''s coat or no. &l33&rAnd he knew it, and said, It is my son''s coat;
    an evil beast hath'
  '50': devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. &l34&rAnd Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.

  '1': Chapter 37 Cont./n&l35&rAnd all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him. &l36&rAnd the Midianites sold him into
  '2': Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.
  '3': Chapter 38/nAnd it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. &l2&rAnd Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went
  '4': 'in unto her. &l3&rAnd she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name
    Er. &l4&rAnd she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
    &l5&rAnd she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah:
    and he was at Chezib,'
  '5': when she bare him. &l6&rAnd Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. &l7&rAnd Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him. &l8&rAnd Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry
  '6': her, and raise up seed to thy brother. &l9&rAnd Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. &l10&rAnd the thing
  '7': 'which he did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew him also. &l11&rThen said
    Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father''s house, till
    Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren
    did. And Tamar'
  '8': went and dwelt in her father's house. &l12&rAnd in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. &l13&rAnd it was told Tamar, saying,
  '9': Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. &l14&rAnd she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was
  '10': grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. &l15&rWhen Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face. &l16&rAnd he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not
  '11': that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? &l17&rAnd he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? &l18&rAnd he said, What pledge
  '12': shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. &l19&rAnd she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the
  '13': 'garments of her widowhood. &l20&rAnd Judah sent the kid by the hand of his
    friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman''s hand: but he found
    her not. &l21&rThen he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot,
    that was openly by'
  '14': the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place. &l22&rAnd he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place. &l23&rAnd Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we
  '15': 'be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. &l24&rAnd
    it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar
    thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child
    by whoredom. And'
  '16': 'Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. &l25&rWhen she was brought
    forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am
    I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet,
    and bracelets, and'
  '17': staff. &l26&rAnd Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. &l27&rAnd it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her
  '18': 'womb. &l28&rAnd it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
    his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying,
    This came out first. &l29&rAnd it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that,
    behold, his brother'
  '19': 'came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee:
    therefore his name was called Pharez. &l30&rAnd afterward came out his brother,
    that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.'
  '20': Chapter 39/nAnd Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. &l2&rAnd the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a
  '21': 'prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. &l3&rAnd
    his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he
    did to prosper in his hand. &l4&rAnd Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served
    him: and he made'
  '22': him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. &l5&rAnd it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the
  '23': blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. &l6&rAnd he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured. &l7&rAnd it
  '24': came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. &l8&rBut he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that
  '25': 'he hath to my hand; &l9&rThere is none greater in this house than I; neither
    hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then
    can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? &l10&rAnd it came to pass,
    as she spake to'
  '26': Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. &l11&rAnd it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. &l12&rAnd she
  '27': 'caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in
    her hand, and fled, and got him out. &l13&rAnd it came to pass, when she saw that
    he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, &l14&rThat she called
    unto the men of her'
  '28': 'house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto
    us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
    &l15&rAnd it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried,
    that he left his'
  '29': 'garment with me, and fled, and got him out. &l16&rAnd she laid up his garment
    by her, until his lord came home. &l17&rAnd she spake unto him according to these
    words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto
    me to mock me:'
  '30': '&l18&rAnd it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left
    his garment with me, and fled out. &l19&rAnd it came to pass, when his master
    heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner
    did thy servant to me;'
  '31': 'that his wrath was kindled. &l20&rAnd Joseph''s master took him, and put
    him into the prison, a place where the king''s prisoners were bound: and he was
    there in the prison. &l21&rBut the Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy,
    and gave him favour in the'
  '32': sight of the keeper of the prison. &l22&rAnd the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. &l23&rThe keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that
  '33': was under his hand; because the Lord was with him, and that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper.
  '34': Chapter 40/nAnd it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. &l2&rAnd Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the
  '35': 'chief of the bakers. &l3&rAnd he put them in ward in the house of the captain
    of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. &l4&rAnd the
    captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued
    a season in'
  '36': ward. &l5&rAnd they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison. &l6&rAnd Joseph came in unto them in
  '37': the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad. &l7&rAnd he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day? &l8&rAnd they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and
  '38': there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. &l9&rAnd the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; &l10&rAnd in the vine
  '39': 'were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot
    forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: &l11&rAnd Pharaoh''s
    cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh''s cup,
    and I gave the cup'
  '40': 'into Pharaoh''s hand. &l12&rAnd Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation
    of it: The three branches are three days: &l13&rYet within three days shall Pharaoh
    lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh''s
    cup'
  '41': 'into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. &l14&rBut
    think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto
    me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: &l15&rFor
    indeed I was'
  '42': 'stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing
    that they should put me into the dungeon. &l16&rWhen the chief baker saw that
    the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and,
    behold, I had three'
  '43': 'white baskets on my head: &l17&rAnd in the uppermost basket there was of
    all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket
    upon my head. &l18&rAnd Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof:
    The three'
  '44': 'baskets are three days: &l19&rYet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up
    thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat
    thy flesh from off thee. &l20&rAnd it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh''s
    birthday, that he'
  '45': 'made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief
    butler and of the chief baker among his servants. &l21&rAnd he restored the chief
    butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh''s hand: &l22&rBut
    he hanged the'
  '46': 'chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. &l23&rYet did not the chief
    butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.'
  '47': 'Chapter 41/nAnd it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
    dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. &l2&rAnd, behold, there came up out
    of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
    &l3&rAnd, behold,'
  '48': seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. &l4&rAnd the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
  '49': '&l5&rAnd he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of
    corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. &l6&rAnd, behold, seven thin ears
    and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. &l7&rAnd the seven thin ears
    devoured the seven'
  '50': rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

  '1': 'Chapter 41 Cont./n&l8&rAnd it came to pass in the morning that his spirit
    was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the
    wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could
    interpret them unto'
  '2': 'Pharaoh. &l9&rThen spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember
    my faults this day: &l10&rPharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward
    in the captain of the guard''s house, both me and the chief baker: &l11&rAnd we
    dreamed a dream'
  '3': in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. &l12&rAnd there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man
  '4': 'according to his dream he did interpret. &l13&rAnd it came to pass, as he

    it.'
  '6': '&l16&rAnd Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give
    Pharaoh an answer of peace. &l17&rAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold,
    I stood upon the bank of the river: &l18&rAnd, behold, there came up out of the
    river seven'
  '7': 'kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: &l19&rAnd, behold,
    seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed,
    such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: &l20&rAnd the lean and
    the ill'
  '8': 'favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: &l21&rAnd when they had
    eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still
    ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. &l22&rAnd I saw in my dream, and,
    behold, seven'
  '9': 'ears came up in one stalk, full and good: &l23&rAnd, behold, seven ears, withered,
    thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: &l24&rAnd the thin
    ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there
    was none that'
  '10': 'could declare it to me. &l25&rAnd Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of
    Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. &l26&rThe seven
    good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream
    is one. &l27&rAnd the'
  '11': 'seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years;
    and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
    &l28&rThis is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to
    do he sheweth unto'
  '12': 'Pharaoh. &l29&rBehold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout
    all the land of Egypt: &l30&rAnd there shall arise after them seven years of famine;
    and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall
    consume the land;'
  '13': ' &l31&rAnd the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine
    following; for it shall be very grievous. &l32&rAnd for that the dream was doubled
    unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will
    shortly bring'
  '14': it to pass. &l33&rNow therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. &l34&rLet Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
  '15': years. &l35&rAnd let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. &l36&rAnd that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall
  '16': be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. &l37&rAnd the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. &l38&rAnd Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the
  '17': 'Spirit of God is? &l39&rAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath
    shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: &l40&rThou
    shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled:
    only in the'
  '18': throne will I be greater than thou. &l41&rAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. &l42&rAnd Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a
  '19': 'gold chain about his neck; &l43&rAnd he made him to ride in the second chariot
    which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over
    all the land of Egypt. &l44&rAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without
    thee shall'
  '20': no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. &l45&rAnd Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. &l46&rAnd Joseph was
  '21': thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. &l47&rAnd in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. &l48&rAnd he gathered up
  '22': 'all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid
    up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every
    city, laid he up in the same. &l49&rAnd Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the
    sea, very much, until'
  '23': 'he left numbering; for it was without number. &l50&rAnd unto Joseph were
    born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah
    priest of On bare unto him. &l51&rAnd Joseph called the name of the firstborn
    Manasseh: For'
  '24': 'God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father''s house.
    &l52&rAnd the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to
    be fruitful in the land of my affliction. &l53&rAnd the seven years of plenteousness,
    that was in the'
  '25': 'land of Egypt, were ended. &l54&rAnd the seven years of dearth began to come,
    according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the
    land of Egypt there was bread. &l55&rAnd when all the land of Egypt was famished,
    the people cried'
  '26': 'to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph;
    what he saith to you, do. &l56&rAnd the famine was over all the face of the earth:
    and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine
    waxed sore'
  '27': in the land of Egypt. &l57&rAnd all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.
  '28': 'Chapter 42/nNow when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto
    his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? &l2&rAnd he said, Behold, I have heard
    that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence;
    that we may live,'
  '29': and not die. &l3&rAnd Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. &l4&rBut Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. &l5&rAnd the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those
  '30': 'that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. &l6&rAnd Joseph was
    the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land:
    and Joseph''s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces
    to the earth.'
  '31': '&l7&rAnd Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange
    unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye?
    And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. &l8&rAnd Joseph knew his brethren,
    but they knew'
  '32': not him. &l9&rAnd Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. &l10&rAnd they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. &l11&rWe are all one
  '33': man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. &l12&rAnd he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. &l13&rAnd they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the
  '34': 'youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. &l14&rAnd Joseph said
    unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: &l15&rHereby
    ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except
    your youngest brother'
  '35': 'come hither. &l16&rSend one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye
    shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth
    in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. &l17&rAnd he put them
    all together'
  '36': 'into ward three days. &l18&rAnd Joseph said unto them the third day, This
    do, and live; for I fear God: &l19&rIf ye be true men, let one of your brethren
    be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
    houses: &l20&rBut bring'
  '37': your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. &l21&rAnd they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we
  '38': would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. &l22&rAnd Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. &l23&rAnd they knew not that
  '39': Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. &l24&rAnd he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. &l25&rThen Joseph
  '40': 'commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man''s money
    into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
    &l26&rAnd they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. &l27&rAnd
    as one of them opened'
  '41': 'his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for,
    behold, it was in his sack''s mouth. &l28&rAnd he said unto his brethren, My money
    is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and
    they were afraid,'
  '42': saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? &l29&rAnd they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, &l30&rThe man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took
  '43': 'us for spies of the country. &l31&rAnd we said unto him, We are true men;
    we are no spies: &l32&rWe be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not,
    and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. &l33&rAnd
    the man, the lord of the'
  '44': 'country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one
    of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households,
    and be gone: &l34&rAnd bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know
    that ye are no spies,'
  '45': 'but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall
    traffick in the land. &l35&rAnd it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that,
    behold, every man''s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their
    father saw the'
  '46': 'bundles of money, they were afraid. &l36&rAnd Jacob their father said unto
    them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and
    ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me. &l37&rAnd Reuben
    spake unto his father,'
  '47': 'saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my
    hand, and I will bring him to thee again. &l38&rAnd he said, My son shall not
    go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall
    him by the way in'
  '48': the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
  '49': Chapter 43/nAnd the famine was sore in the land. &l2&rAnd it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. &l3&rAnd Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did
  '50': 'solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
    be with you. &l4&rIf thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
    thee food:'

    whether ye had yet a'
  '2': 'brother? &l7&rAnd they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of
    our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we
    told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he
    would say, Bring your'

    me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou,

  '4': 'bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame
    for ever: &l10&rFor except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second

    take of the'
  '5': 'best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present,
    a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: &l12&rAnd

    also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: &l14&rAnd God Almighty give
    you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin.
    If I be bereaved of'
  '7': my children, I am bereaved. &l15&rAnd the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. &l16&rAnd when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his
  '8': house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. &l17&rAnd the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. &l18&rAnd the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's
  '9': house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. &l19&rAnd they came near to the steward of
  '10': 'Joseph''s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, &l20&rAnd
    said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: &l21&rAnd it came
    to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every
    man''s money was'
  '11': 'in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it
    again in our hand. &l22&rAnd other money have we brought down in our hands to
    buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. &l23&rAnd he said, Peace

  '12': 'your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks:
    I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. &l24&rAnd the man brought
    the men into Joseph''s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet;
    and he gave their'
  '13': 'asses provender. &l25&rAnd they made ready the present against Joseph came
    at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. &l26&rAnd when Joseph
    came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house,
    and bowed themselves'
  '14': to him to the earth. &l27&rAnd he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? &l28&rAnd they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their
  '15': heads, and made obeisance. &l29&rAnd he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. &l30&rAnd Joseph made haste; for
  '16': 'his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he
    entered into his chamber, and wept there. &l31&rAnd he washed his face, and went
    out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. &l32&rAnd they set on for
    him by himself, and'
  '17': 'for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by
    themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that
    is an abomination unto the Egyptians. &l33&rAnd they sat before him, the firstborn
    according to his'
  '18': 'birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled
    one at another. &l34&rAnd he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
    Benjamin''s mess was five times so much as any of their''s. And they drank, and
    were merry with him.'
  '19': Chapter 44/nAnd he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. &l2&rAnd put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn
  '20': money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. &l3&rAs soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. &l4&rAnd when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow
  '21': after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? &l5&rIs not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. &l6&rAnd he overtook them, and he spake
  '22': 'unto them these same words. &l7&rAnd they said unto him, Wherefore saith
    my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this
    thing: &l8&rBehold, the money, which we found in our sacks'' mouths, we brought
    again unto thee out of the'
  '23': 'land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord''s house silver
    or gold? &l9&rWith whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and
    we also will be my lord''s bondmen. &l10&rAnd he said, Now also let it be according
    unto your words: he'
  '24': 'with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. &l11&rThen
    they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man
    his sack. &l12&rAnd he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest:
    and the cup'
  '25': 'was found in Benjamin''s sack. &l13&rThen they rent their clothes, and laded
    every man his ass, and returned to the city. &l14&rAnd Judah and his brethren
    came to Joseph''s house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the
    ground. &l15&rAnd Joseph'
  '26': said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? &l16&rAnd Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy
  '27': 'servants: behold, we are my lord''s servants, both we, and he also with whom
    the cup is found. &l17&rAnd he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man
    in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you
    up in peace unto'
  '28': 'your father. &l18&rThen Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let
    thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord''s ears, and let not thine anger
    burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. &l19&rMy lord asked his
    servants, saying,'
  '29': Have ye a father, or a brother? &l20&rAnd we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. &l21&rAnd thou saidst unto thy
  '30': 'servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. &l22&rAnd
    we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave
    his father, his father would die. &l23&rAnd thou saidst unto thy servants, Except
    your youngest'
  '31': brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. &l24&rAnd it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. &l25&rAnd our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food. &l26&rAnd we said, We cannot go
  '32': 'down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may
    not see the man''s face, except our youngest brother be with us. &l27&rAnd thy
    servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: &l28&rAnd
    the one went out from'
  '33': 'me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: &l29&rAnd
    if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my
    gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. &l30&rNow therefore when I come to thy servant
    my father, and'
  '34': 'the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad''s life;
    &l31&rIt shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he
    will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our
    father with sorrow to'
  '35': the grave. &l32&rFor thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. &l33&rNow therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my
  '36': lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. &l34&rFor how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.
  '37': 'Chapter 45/nThen Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood
    by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man
    with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. &l2&rAnd he wept
    aloud: and the'
  '38': Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. &l3&rAnd Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. &l4&rAnd Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me,
  '39': 'I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom
    ye sold into Egypt. &l5&rNow therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves,
    that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. &l6&rFor

    there shall neither be earing nor harvest. &l7&rAnd God sent me before you to
    preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
    &l8&rSo now it'

    in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children,
    and thy children''s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou
    hast: &l11&rAnd there'
  '43': will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty. &l12&rAnd, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. &l13&rAnd
  '44': ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. &l14&rAnd he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. &l15&rMoreover he kissed all
  '45': 'his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with
    him. &l16&rAnd the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh''s house, saying, Joseph''s
    brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. &l17&rAnd Pharaoh
    said unto Joseph,'
  '46': 'Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto
    the land of Canaan; &l18&rAnd take your father and your households, and come unto
    me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat
    of the land.'
  '47': '&l19&rNow thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land
    of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and
    come. &l20&rAlso regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt
    is your''s. &l21&rAnd the'
  '48': 'children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the
    commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. &l22&rTo all of them
    he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces
    of silver, and five'
  '49': 'changes of raiment. &l23&rAnd to his father he sent after this manner; ten
    asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and

  '12': born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. &l21&rAnd the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. &l22&rThese are the sons of
  '13': 'Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. &l23&rAnd
    the sons of Dan; Hushim. &l24&rAnd the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and
    Jezer, and Shillem. &l25&rThese are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto
    Rachel his daughter, and'
  '14': 'she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven. &l26&rAll the souls
    that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob''s
    sons'' wives, all the souls were threescore and six; &l27&rAnd the sons of Joseph,
    which were born him in'
  '15': 'Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into
    Egypt, were threescore and ten. &l28&rAnd he sent Judah before him unto Joseph,
    to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. &l29&rAnd
    Joseph made ready'
  '16': his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. &l30&rAnd Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet
  '17': alive. &l31&rAnd Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; &l32&rAnd the men are shepherds, for
  '18': their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. &l33&rAnd it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? &l34&rThat ye shall say, Thy servants'
  '19': 'trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and
    also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd
    is an abomination unto the Egyptians.'
  '20': Chapter 47/nThen Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen. &l2&rAnd he took some of his
  '21': brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. &l3&rAnd Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers. &l4&rThey said morever unto Pharaoh, For to
  '22': 'sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their
    flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee,
    let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen. &l5&rAnd Pharaoh spake unto Joseph,
    saying, Thy'
  '23': 'father and thy brethren are come unto thee: &l6&rThe land of Egypt is before
    thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land
    of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them,
    then make them'
  '24': 'rulers over my cattle. &l7&rAnd Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set
    him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. &l8&rAnd Pharaoh said unto Jacob,
    How old art thou? &l9&rAnd Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my
    pilgrimage are an'
  '25': 'hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life
    been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers
    in the days of their pilgrimage. &l10&rAnd Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out
    from before'
  '26': Pharaoh. &l11&rAnd Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. &l12&rAnd Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
  '27': father's household, with bread, according to their families. &l13&rAnd there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. &l14&rAnd Joseph gathered up all
  '28': 'the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan,
    for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh''s house.
    &l15&rAnd when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all
    the Egyptians came'
  '29': 'unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence?
    for the money faileth. &l16&rAnd Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give
    you for your cattle, if money fail. &l17&rAnd they brought their cattle unto Joseph:
    and Joseph'
  '30': 'gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle
    of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle
    for that year. &l18&rWhen that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
    and said unto'
  '31': 'him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord
    also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord,
    but our bodies, and our lands: &l19&rWherefore shall we die before thine eyes,
    both we and our land?'
  '32': 'buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto
    Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not
    desolate. &l20&rAnd Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians
    sold every man'
  '33': 'his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh''s.
    &l21&rAnd as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders
    of Egypt even to the other end thereof. &l22&rOnly the land of the priests bought
    he not;'
  '34': 'for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their
    portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands. &l23&rThen
    Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land
    for Pharaoh: lo, here'
  '35': is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. &l24&rAnd it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and
  '36': 'for food for your little ones. &l25&rAnd they said, Thou hast saved our lives:
    let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh''s servants.
    &l26&rAnd Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh
    should have the'
  '37': fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's. &l27&rAnd Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly. &l28&rAnd Jacob lived in the land of
  '38': 'Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and
    seven years. &l29&rAnd the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called
    his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put,
    I pray thee, thy hand'
  '39': 'under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee,
    in Egypt: &l30&rBut I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
    Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast
    said. &l31&rAnd he'
  '40': said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
  '41': 'Chapter 48/nAnd it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,
    Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
    &l2&rAnd one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and
    Israel'
  '42': strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. &l3&rAnd Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, &l4&rAnd said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a
  '43': multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. &l5&rAnd now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and
  '44': Simeon, they shall be mine. &l6&rAnd thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. &l7&rAnd as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan
  '45': 'in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and
    I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem. &l8&rAnd Israel
    beheld Joseph''s sons, and said, Who are these? &l9&rAnd Joseph said unto his
    father, They are my'
  '46': sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. &l10&rNow the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced
  '47': 'them. &l11&rAnd Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:
    and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. &l12&rAnd Joseph brought them out from
    between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. &l13&rAnd
    Joseph took them'
  '48': both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. &l14&rAnd Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and
  '49': his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. &l15&rAnd he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, &l16&rThe
  '50': Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

    hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father''s
    hand, to remove it from Ephraim''s head unto Manasseh''s head. &l18&rAnd Joseph
    said unto his father, Not'

  '21': Heth. &l33&rAnd when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.

    for him; for so are'
  '23': 'fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned
    for him threescore and ten days. &l4&rAnd when the days of his mourning were past,
    Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your
    eyes, speak, I'
  '24': 'pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, &l5&rMy father made me swear, saying,
    Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there
    shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father,
    and I will come'
  '25': 'again. &l6&rAnd Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he
    made thee swear. &l7&rAnd Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went
    up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of
    the land of Egypt,'
  '26': '&l8&rAnd all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father''s house:
    only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land
    of Goshen. &l9&rAnd there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it
    was a very great'
  '27': 'company. &l10&rAnd they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
    Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he
    made a mourning for his father seven days. &l11&rAnd when the inhabitants of the
    land, the Canaanites,'
  '28': 'saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning
    to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond
    Jordan. &l12&rAnd his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: &l13&rFor
    his sons'
  '29': carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. &l14&rAnd Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his
  '30': brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. &l15&rAnd when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we
  '31': 'did unto him. &l16&rAnd they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father
    did command before he died, saying, &l17&rSo shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive,
    I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto
    thee evil: and'
  '32': now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. &l18&rAnd his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. &l19&rAnd Joseph said
  '33': 'unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? &l20&rBut as for you,
    ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it
    is this day, to save much people alive. &l21&rNow therefore fear ye not: I will
    nourish you, and your'
  '34': 'little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. &l22&rAnd
    Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father''s house: and Joseph lived an hundred
    and ten years. &l23&rAnd Joseph saw Ephraim''s children of the third generation:
    the children also of'
  '35': 'Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph''s knees. &l24&rAnd
    Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring
    you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
    Jacob. &l25&rAnd Joseph'
  '36': 'took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you,
    and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. &l26&rSo Joseph died, being an hundred
    and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.'
