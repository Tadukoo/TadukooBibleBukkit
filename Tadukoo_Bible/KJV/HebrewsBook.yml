  '1': 'Chapter 1

    God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers
    by the prophets, &l2&rHath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom
    he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; &l3&rWho
    being'
  '2': 'the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding
    all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat
    down on the right hand of the Majesty on high: &l4&rBeing made so much better
    than the angels,'
  '3': as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. &l5&rFor unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? &l6&rAnd again,
  '4': when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. &l7&rAnd of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. &l8&rBut unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God,
  '5': 'is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
    &l9&rThou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy
    God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. &l10&rAnd,
    Thou, Lord, in'
  '6': 'the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the
    works of thine hands: &l11&rThey shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all
    shall wax old as doth a garment; &l12&rAnd as a vesture shalt thou fold them up,
    and they shall be'
  '7': 'changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. &l13&rBut to
    which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine
    enemies thy footstool? &l14&rAre they not all ministering spirits, sent forth
    to minister for them'
  '8': who shall be heirs of salvation?
  '9': 'Chapter 2

    Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard,
    lest at any time we should let them slip. &l2&rFor if the word spoken by angels
    was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence'
  '10': of reward; &l3&rHow shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; &l4&rGod also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers
  '11': miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will? &l5&rFor unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. &l6&rBut one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or
  '12': 'the son of man that thou visitest him? &l7&rThou madest him a little lower
    than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over
    the works of thy hands: &l8&rThou hast put all things in subjection under his
    feet. For in that he'
  '13': put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him. &l9&rBut we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that
  '14': he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. &l10&rFor it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. &l11&rFor both he
  '15': 'that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause
    he is not ashamed to call them brethren, &l12&rSaying, I will declare thy name
    unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. &l13&rAnd
    again, I will'
  '16': put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. &l14&rForasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the
  '17': power of death, that is, the devil; &l15&rAnd deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. &l16&rFor verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. &l17&rWherefore in all things
  '18': it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. &l18&rFor in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to
  '19': succour them that are tempted.
  '20': 'Chapter 3

    Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle
    and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; &l2&rWho was faithful to him
    that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house. &l3&rFor this
    man was'
  '21': counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. &l4&rFor every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God. &l5&rAnd Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a
  '22': servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; &l6&rBut Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. &l7&rWherefore (as the Holy Ghost
  '23': 'saith, To day if ye will hear his voice, &l8&rHarden not your hearts, as
    in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: &l9&rWhen your
    fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. &l10&rWherefore I
    was grieved with that'
  '24': generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. &l11&rSo I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) &l12&rTake heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from
  '25': the living God. &l13&rBut exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. &l14&rFor we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
  '26': '&l15&rWhile it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
    hearts, as in the provocation. &l16&rFor some, when they had heard, did provoke:
    howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. &l17&rBut with whom was he grieved
    forty years? was'
  '27': it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? &l18&rAnd to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? &l19&rSo we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
  '28': 'Chapter 4

    Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest,
    any of you should seem to come short of it. &l2&rFor unto us was the gospel preached,
    as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed'
  '29': 'with faith in them that heard it. &l3&rFor we which have believed do enter
    into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my
    rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. &l4&rFor
    he spake in a'
  '30': certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. &l5&rAnd in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. &l6&rSeeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was
  '31': 'first preached entered not in because of unbelief: &l7&rAgain, he limiteth
    a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To
    day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. &l8&rFor if Jesus had given
    them rest, then'
  '32': would he not afterward have spoken of another day. &l9&rThere remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. &l10&rFor he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. &l11&rLet us labour therefore to enter
  '33': into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. &l12&rFor the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a
  '34': 'discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. &l13&rNeither is there
    any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened
    unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. &l14&rSeeing then that we have a
    great high priest,'
  '35': that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. &l15&rFor we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
  '36': '&l16&rLet us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
    obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'
  '37': 'Chapter 5

    For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining
    to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: &l2&rWho can have
    compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he'
  '38': himself also is compassed with infirmity. &l3&rAnd by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. &l4&rAnd no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. &l5&rSo also Christ
  '39': glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. &l6&rAs he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. &l7&rWho in the days of his flesh,
  '40': when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; &l8&rThough he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; &l9&rAnd
  '41': being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; &l10&rCalled of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec. &l11&rOf whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.
  '42': '&l12&rFor when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one
    teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become
    such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. &l13&rFor every one that useth
    milk is'
  '43': 'unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. &l14&rBut strong
    meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have
    their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.'
  '44': 'Chapter 6

    Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto
    perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and
    of faith toward God, &l2&rOf the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands,
    and of'
  '45': resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. &l3&rAnd this will we do, if God permit. &l4&rFor it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, &l5&rAnd have tasted
  '46': the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, &l6&rIf they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. &l7&rFor the earth which drinketh in the
  '47': 'rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom
    it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: &l8&rBut that which beareth thorns
    and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned. &l9&rBut,
    beloved, we'
  '48': are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. &l10&rFor God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do
  '49': 'minister. &l11&rAnd we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence
    to the full assurance of hope unto the end: &l12&rThat ye be not slothful, but
    followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. &l13&rFor
    when God made'
  '50': promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, &l14&rSaying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. &l15&rAnd so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

    &l16&rFor men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to
    them an end of all strife. &l17&rWherein God, willing more abundantly to shew
    unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an
    oath:'
  '2': '&l18&rThat by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to
    lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold
    upon the hope set before us: &l19&rWhich hope we have as an anchor of the soul,
    both sure and stedfast,'
  '3': and which entereth into that within the veil; &l20&rWhither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
  '4': 'Chapter 7

    For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham
    returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; &l2&rTo whom also
    Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness,'
  '5': and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; &l3&rWithout father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually. &l4&rNow consider how
  '6': great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. &l5&rAnd verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that
  '7': 'is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: &l6&rBut
    he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed
    him that had the promises. &l7&rAnd without all contradiction the less is blessed
    of the better.'
  '8': ' &l8&rAnd here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of
    whom it is witnessed that he liveth. &l9&rAnd as I may so say, Levi also, who
    receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. &l10&rFor he was yet in the loins of
    his father, when'
  '9': Melchisedec met him. &l11&rIf therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order
  '10': of Aaron? &l12&rFor the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. &l13&rFor he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. &l14&rFor it is evident that our
  '11': 'Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
    &l15&rAnd it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec
    there ariseth another priest, &l16&rWho is made, not after the law of a carnal'
  '12': commandment, but after the power of an endless life. &l17&rFor he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. &l18&rFor there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
  '13': ' &l19&rFor the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better
    hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God. &l20&rAnd inasmuch as not without
    an oath he was made priest: &l21&r(For those priests were made without an oath;
    but this with an oath'
  '14': by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) &l22&rBy so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. &l23&rAnd they truly were many priests, because they were not
  '15': 'suffered to continue by reason of death: &l24&rBut this man, because he continueth
    ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. &l25&rWherefore he is able also to save
    them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
    intercession'
  '16': for them. &l26&rFor such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; &l27&rWho needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for
  '17': 'the people''s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. &l28&rFor
    the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath,
    which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.'
  '18': 'Chapter 8

    Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest,
    who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; &l2&rA
    minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched,'
  '19': 'and not man. &l3&rFor every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:
    wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. &l4&rFor
    if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests
    that offer'
  '20': 'gifts according to the law: &l5&rWho serve unto the example and shadow of
    heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the
    tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern
    shewed to thee in the'
  '21': mount. &l6&rBut now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. &l7&rFor if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought
  '22': 'for the second. &l8&rFor finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days
    come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel
    and with the house of Judah: &l9&rNot according to the covenant that I made with
    their fathers in'
  '23': the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. &l10&rFor this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith
  '24': 'the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts:
    and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: &l11&rAnd they
    shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know
    the Lord: for all'
  '25': shall know me, from the least to the greatest. &l12&rFor I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. &l13&rIn that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth
  '26': and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.
  '27': 'Chapter 9

    Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly
    sanctuary. &l2&rFor there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick,
    and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. &l3&rAnd'
  '28': after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; &l4&rWhich had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables
  '29': of the covenant; &l5&rAnd over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly. &l6&rNow when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.
  '30': ' &l7&rBut into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not
    without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:
    &l8&rThe Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was
    not yet made manifest,'
  '31': 'while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: &l9&rWhich was a figure for
    the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could
    not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; &l10&rWhich
    stood'
  '32': only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. &l11&rBut Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is
  '33': to say, not of this building; &l12&rNeither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. &l13&rFor if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
  '34': 'sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: &l14&rHow
    much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself
    without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living
    God? &l15&rAnd'
  '35': for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. &l16&rFor where a
  '36': 'testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.
    &l17&rFor a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength
    at all while the testator liveth. &l18&rWhereupon neither the first testament
    was dedicated'
  '37': without blood. &l19&rFor when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, &l20&rSaying, This is
  '38': the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. &l21&rMoreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. &l22&rAnd almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no
  '39': remission. &l23&rIt was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. &l24&rFor Christ is not entered into the holy places made with
  '40': 'hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to
    appear in the presence of God for us: &l25&rNor yet that he should offer himself
    often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of
    others; &l26&rFor then'
  '41': 'must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once
    in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
    &l27&rAnd as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
    &l28&rSo'
  '42': Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
  '43': 'Chapter 10

    For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of
    the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually
    make the comers thereunto perfect. &l2&rFor then would they not have ceased to'
  '44': be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. &l3&rBut in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. &l4&rFor it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take
  '45': 'away sins. &l5&rWherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
    and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: &l6&rIn burnt
    offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. &l7&rThen said I,
    Lo, I come (in the'
  '46': volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. &l8&rAbove when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; &l9&rThen said he, Lo,
  '47': I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. &l10&rBy the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. &l11&rAnd every priest standeth daily ministering and
  '48': 'offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
    &l12&rBut this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat
    down on the right hand of God; &l13&rFrom henceforth expecting till his enemies
    be made his footstool.'
  '49': '&l14&rFor by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
    &l15&rWhereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said
    before, &l16&rThis is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,
    saith the Lord,'
  '50': I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; &l17&rAnd their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. &l18&rNow where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.

  '6': he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? &l30&rFor we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. &l31&rIt is a fearful
  '7': thing to fall into the hands of the living God. &l32&rBut call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; &l33&rPartly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions;
  '8': and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. &l34&rFor ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. &l35&rCast not
  '9': away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. &l36&rFor ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. &l37&rFor yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not
  '10': 'tarry. &l38&rNow the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back,
    my soul shall have no pleasure in him. &l39&rBut we are not of them who draw back
    unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.'
  '11': 'Chapter 11

    Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
    &l2&rFor by it the elders obtained a good report. &l3&rThrough faith we understand
    that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen'
  '12': 'were not made of things which do appear. &l4&rBy faith Abel offered unto
    God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he
    was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
    &l5&rBy faith Enoch'
  '13': 'was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God
    had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he
    pleased God. &l6&rBut without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
    cometh to God must'
  '14': believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. &l7&rBy faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became
  '15': heir of the righteousness which is by faith. &l8&rBy faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. &l9&rBy faith he sojourned in the land of
  '16': 'promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and
    Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: &l10&rFor he looked for a city
    which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. &l11&rThrough faith also
    Sara herself received'
  '17': strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. &l12&rTherefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the
  '18': sand which is by the sea shore innumerable. &l13&rThese all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
  '19': '&l14&rFor they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
    &l15&rAnd truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came
    out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. &l16&rBut now they desire
    a better country,'
  '20': 'that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God:
    for he hath prepared for them a city. &l17&rBy faith Abraham, when he was tried,
    offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten
    son, &l18&rOf'
  '21': 'whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: &l19&rAccounting
    that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received
    him in a figure. &l20&rBy faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things
    to come. &l21&rBy'
  '22': faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff. &l22&rBy faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
  '23': '&l23&rBy faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents,
    because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king''s
    commandment. &l24&rBy faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called
    the son of'
  '24': 'Pharaoh''s daughter; &l25&rChoosing rather to suffer affliction with the
    people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; &l26&rEsteeming
    the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had
    respect unto the'
  '25': 'recompence of the reward. &l27&rBy faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the
    wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. &l28&rThrough
    faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed
    the firstborn should'
  '26': 'touch them. &l29&rBy faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land:
    which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. &l30&rBy faith the walls of Jericho
    fell down, after they were compassed about seven days. &l31&rBy faith the harlot
    Rahab perished'
  '27': 'not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.
    &l32&rAnd what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon,
    and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of
    the prophets:'
  '28': '&l33&rWho through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained
    promises, stopped the mouths of lions. &l34&rQuenched the violence of fire, escaped
    the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight,
    turned to flight'
  '29': 'the armies of the aliens. &l35&rWomen received their dead raised to life
    again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain
    a better resurrection: &l36&rAnd others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings,
    yea, moreover of'
  '30': 'bonds and imprisonment: &l37&rThey were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were
    tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins;
    being destitute, afflicted, tormented; &l38&r(Of whom the world was not worthy:)
    they wandered'
  '31': 'in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. &l39&rAnd
    these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
    &l40&rGod having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should
    not be made'
  '32': perfect.
  '33': 'Chapter 12

    Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses,
    let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and
    let us run with patience the race that is set before us, &l2&rLooking unto Jesus
    the'
  '34': author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. &l3&rFor consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest
  '35': ye be wearied and faint in your minds. &l4&rYe have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. &l5&rAnd ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when
  '36': 'thou art rebuked of him: &l6&rFor whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and
    scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. &l7&rIf ye endure chastening, God dealeth
    with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? &l8&rBut
    if ye be without'
  '37': 'chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
    &l9&rFurthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave
    them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits,
    and live?'
  '38': '&l10&rFor they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure;
    but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. &l11&rNow no
    chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward
    it yieldeth'
  '39': the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. &l12&rWherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; &l13&rAnd make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it
  '40': 'rather be healed. &l14&rFollow peace with all men, and holiness, without
    which no man shall see the Lord: &l15&rLooking diligently lest any man fail of
    the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby
    many be defiled;'
  '41': '&l16&rLest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one
    morsel of meat sold his birthright. &l17&rFor ye know how that afterward, when
    he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of
    repentance, though he'
  '42': sought it carefully with tears. &l18&rFor ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, &l19&rAnd the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard
  '43': 'intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: &l20&r(For
    they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch
    the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart: &l21&rAnd so
    terrible was the sight,'
  '44': that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:) &l22&rBut ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, &l23&rTo the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which
  '45': are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, &l24&rAnd to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. &l25&rSee that ye refuse
  '46': 'not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake
    on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh
    from heaven: &l26&rWhose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised,
    saying, Yet once more I'
  '47': shake not the earth only, but also heaven. &l27&rAnd this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. &l28&rWherefore we receiving a kingdom
  '48': 'which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably
    with reverence and godly fear: &l29&rFor our God is a consuming fire.'
  '49': 'Chapter 13

    Let brotherly love continue. &l2&rBe not forgetful to entertain strangers: for
    thereby some have entertained angels unawares. &l3&rRemember them that are in
    bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves
    also in'
  '50': 'the body. &l4&rMarriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
    whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.'

    &l5&rLet your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things
    as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. &l6&rSo
    that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what'

  '5': without the gate. &l13&rLet us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. &l14&rFor here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. &l15&rBy him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is,
