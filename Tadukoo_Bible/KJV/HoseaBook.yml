  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The word of the Lord that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah,
    Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son
    of Joash, king of Israel. &l2&rThe beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea.
    And'
  '2': 'the Lord said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children
    of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord.
    &l3&rSo he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare
    him a son.'
  '3': '&l4&rAnd the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while,
    and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause
    to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. &l5&rAnd it shall come to pass at
    that day, that I'
  '4': 'will break the bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel. &l6&rAnd she conceived
    again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for
    I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them
    away. &l7&rBut I'
  '5': will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. &l8&rNow when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son. &l9&rThen said
  '6': 'God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your
    God. &l10&rYet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the
    sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in
    the place where it'
  '7': was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. &l11&rThen shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up
  '8': 'out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.'
  '9': 'Chapter 2

    Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah. &l2&rPlead with
    your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her
    therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between
    her'
  '10': breasts; &l3&rLest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst. &l4&rAnd I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.
  '11': ' &l5&rFor their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath
    done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread
    and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink. &l6&rTherefore, behold,
    I will hedge up'
  '12': 'thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
    &l7&rAnd she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and
    she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and
    return to my first'
  '13': husband; for then was it better with me than now. &l8&rFor she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal. &l9&rTherefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof,
  '14': and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness. &l10&rAnd now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand. &l11&rI will also cause all her mirth
  '15': 'to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn
    feasts. &l12&rAnd I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath
    said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them
    a forest, and the'
  '16': beasts of the field shall eat them. &l13&rAnd I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the Lord.
  '17': '&l14&rTherefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness,
    and speak comfortably unto her. &l15&rAnd I will give her her vineyards from thence,
    and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the
    days of her'
  '18': youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. &l16&rAnd it shall be at that day, saith the Lord, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali. &l17&rFor I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they
  '19': 'shall no more be remembered by their name. &l18&rAnd in that day will I make
    a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven,
    and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword
    and the battle'
  '20': out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely. &l19&rAnd I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. &l20&rI will even betroth thee unto me in
  '21': 'faithfulness: and thou shalt know the Lord. &l21&rAnd it shall come to pass
    in that day, I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the heavens, and they shall
    hear the earth; &l22&rAnd the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the
    oil; and they shall'
  '22': hear Jezreel. &l23&rAnd I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.
  '23': 'Chapter 3

    Then said the Lord unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an
    adulteress, according to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel, who
    look to other gods, and love flagons of wine. &l2&rSo I bought her to me for fifteen'
  '24': 'pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:
    &l3&rAnd I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play
    the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.
    &l4&rFor the children'
  '25': 'of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and
    without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:
    &l5&rAfterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God,
    and David'
  '26': their king; and shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter days.
  '27': 'Chapter 4

    Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel: for the Lord hath a controversy
    with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge
    of God in the land. &l2&rBy swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing,'
  '28': and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. &l3&rTherefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be
  '29': 'taken away. &l4&rYet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people
    are as they that strive with the priest. &l5&rTherefore shalt thou fall in the
    day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy
    thy mother. &l6&rMy'
  '30': 'people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge,
    I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast
    forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. &l7&rAs they were
    increased, so'
  '31': 'they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame. &l8&rThey
    eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity. &l9&rAnd
    there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways,
    and reward'
  '32': 'them their doings. &l10&rFor they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall
    commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed
    to the Lord. &l11&rWhoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. &l12&rMy
    people ask counsel'
  '33': 'at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms
    hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. &l13&rThey
    sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under
    oaks'
  '34': 'and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your
    daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery. &l14&rI
    will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when
    they commit adultery:'
  '35': 'for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots:
    therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall. &l15&rThough thou, Israel,
    play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither
    go ye up to'
  '36': 'Bethaven, nor swear, The Lord liveth. &l16&rFor Israel slideth back as a
    backsliding heifer: now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place. &l17&rEphraim
    is joined to idols: let him alone. &l18&rTheir drink is sour: they have committed
    whoredom'
  '37': 'continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye. &l19&rThe wind hath
    bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.'
  '38': 'Chapter 5

    Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house
    of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah,
    and a net spread upon Tabor. &l2&rAnd the revolters are profound to make'
  '39': 'slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all. &l3&rI know Ephraim,
    and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and
    Israel is defiled. &l4&rThey will not frame their doings to turn unto their God:
    for the spirit of'
  '40': 'whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord. &l5&rAnd
    the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim
    fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them. &l6&rThey shall go with
    their flocks and'
  '41': 'with their herds to seek the Lord; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn
    himself from them. &l7&rThey have dealt treacherously against the Lord: for they
    have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.
    &l8&rBlow'
  '42': 'ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven,
    after thee, O Benjamin. &l9&rEphraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among
    the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. &l10&rThe princes
    of Judah were'
  '43': 'like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon
    them like water. &l11&rEphraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he
    willingly walked after the commandment. &l12&rTherefore will I be unto Ephraim
    as a moth, and to the'
  '44': 'house of Judah as rottenness. &l13&rWhen Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah
    saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet
    could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound. &l14&rFor I will be unto Ephraim
    as a lion, and as'
  '45': 'a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will
    take away, and none shall rescue him. &l15&rI will go and return to my place,
    till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they
    will seek me early.'
  '46': 'Chapter 6

    Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us;
    he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. &l2&rAfter two days will he revive us:
    in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. &l3&rThen
    shall we'
  '47': 'know, if we follow on to know the Lord: his going forth is prepared as the
    morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain
    unto the earth. &l4&rO Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall
    I do unto thee? for your'
  '48': 'goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away. &l5&rTherefore
    have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth:
    and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth. &l6&rFor I desired mercy,
    and not'
  '49': 'sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. &l7&rBut they
    like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against
    me. &l8&rGilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.
    &l9&rAnd as'
  '50': 'troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the
    way by consent: for they commit lewdness. &l10&rI have seen an horrible thing
    in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.'

    When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered,
    and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh
    in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without. &l2&rAnd they consider not in their
    hearts'
  '3': 'that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them
    about; they are before my face. &l3&rThey make the king glad with their wickedness,
    and the princes with their lies. &l4&rThey are all adulterers, as an oven heated
    by the baker,'
  '4': who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened. &l5&rIn the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners. &l6&rFor they have made ready their heart like an
  '5': 'oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the
    morning it burneth as a flaming fire. &l7&rThey are all hot as an oven, and have
    devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that

    of Israel testifieth'

    all this. &l11&rEphraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to
    Egypt, they go to Assyria. &l12&rWhen they shall go, I will spread my net upon
    them; I will bring them'
  '8': 'down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation
    hath heard. &l13&rWoe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto

    yet they have spoken'
  '9': 'lies against me. &l14&rAnd they have not cried unto me with their heart, when
    they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they
    rebel against me. &l15&rThough I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do
    they imagine'

    tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.'
  '11': 'Chapter 8

    Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the

    O Samaria, hath cast'
  '13': 'thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they
    attain to innocency? &l6&rFor from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore
    it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. &l7&rFor they
    have sown the'

    yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up. &l8&rIsrael

    pleasure. &l9&rFor'

    them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes. &l11&rBecause
    Ephraim'
  '16': hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin. &l12&rI have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing. &l13&rThey sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the Lord

    the house of his God.'
  '24': '&l9&rThey have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore

    When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. &l2&rAs

  '1': 'Chapter 12 Cont.

    &l9&rAnd I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee
    to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast. &l10&rI have also
    spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by'
  '2': 'the ministry of the prophets. &l11&rIs there iniquity in Gilead? surely they
    are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps
    in the furrows of the fields. &l12&rAnd Jacob fled into the country of Syria,
    and Israel served for a'
  '3': 'wife, and for a wife he kept sheep. &l13&rAnd by a prophet the Lord brought
    Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. &l14&rEphraim provoked
    him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his
    reproach shall his'

  '5': 'Chapter 13

    When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended
    in Baal, he died. &l2&rAnd now they sin more and more, and have made them molten
    images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of
    it'

    the calves. &l3&rTherefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early
    dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the
    floor, and as the'
  '7': 'smoke out of the chimney. &l4&rYet I am the Lord thy God from the land of
    Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me. &l5&rI
    did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought. &l6&rAccording
    to their pasture, so'
  '8': 'were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore
    have they forgotten me. &l7&rTherefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard
    by the way will I observe them: &l8&rI will meet them as a bear that is bereaved
    of her whelps,'
  '9': 'and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a
    lion: the wild beast shall tear them. &l9&rO Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself;
    but in me is thine help. &l10&rI will be thy king: where is any other that may
    save thee in all thy'
  '10': cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes? &l11&rI gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath. &l12&rThe iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid. &l13&rThe sorrows of a travailing woman shall come
  '11': 'upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of
    the breaking forth of children. &l14&rI will ransom them from the power of the
    grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave,
    I will be thy'

    among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up
    from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be
    dried up: he'

    desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword:
    their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped
    up.'

    O israel, return unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
