ch7v1: And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
ch7v2: And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.

ch7v4: And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
ch7v5: Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
ch7v6: 'Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:'
ch7v7: Thus saith the Lord God, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
ch7v8: For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.
ch7v9: And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
ch7v10: Moreover the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying,
ch7v11: Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
ch7v12: But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.
ch7v13: And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
ch7v14: Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
ch7v15: Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
ch7v16: For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.

ch7v18: And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
ch7v19: And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.

ch7v22: 'And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.'
ch7v23: And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.
ch7v24: With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
ch7v25: 'And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.'

ch8v3: And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the Lord to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.
ch8v4: For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
ch8v5: The Lord spake also unto me again, saying,
ch8v6: Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
ch8v7: 'Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:'

ch8v13: Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.

ch28v16: 'Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.'
ch28v17: 'Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.'

ch28v26: For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.
ch28v27: For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
ch28v28: Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.
ch28v29: This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.

ch31v1: Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the Lord!

ch32v1: Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.

ch32v3: And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
ch32v4: The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
ch32v5: The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.
ch32v6: For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the Lord, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
ch32v7: 'The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.'

ch32v13: 'Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:'
ch32v14: Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
ch32v15: Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.
ch32v16: Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
ch32v17: And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.
ch32v18: And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;
ch32v19: When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.
ch32v20: Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.

ch33v1: Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.

ch33v13: Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.

ch36v1: Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.
ch36v2: And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
ch36v3: Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
ch36v4: And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
ch36v5: 'I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?'
ch36v6: 'Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.'
ch36v7: 'But if thou say to me, We trust in the Lord our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?'
ch36v8: Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
ch36v9: How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
ch36v10: And am I now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it? the Lord said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
ch36v11: 'Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews'' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.'
ch36v12: But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
ch36v13: Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
ch36v14: 'Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.'

ch58v4: 'Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.'
ch58v5: Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?
ch58v6: Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?
ch58v7: Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?

ch59v1: 'Behold, the Lord''s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:'
ch59v2: But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.
ch59v3: For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.
ch59v4: 'None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.'
ch59v5: 'They hatch cockatrice'' eggs, and weave the spider''s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.'
ch59v6: 'Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.'
ch59v7: 'Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.'
ch59v8: 'The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.'
ch59v9: 'Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.'
ch59v10: 'We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.'
ch59v11: 'We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.'
ch59v12: 'For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;'
ch59v13: In transgressing and lying against the Lord, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
ch59v14: 'And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.'
ch59v15: 'Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.'
ch59v16: 'And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.'
ch59v17: For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.
ch59v18: According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.
ch59v19: So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.
ch59v20: And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord.

ch60v11: Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.
ch60v12: For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
ch60v13: The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.

ch61v1: The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;
ch61v2: To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
ch61v3: To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.
ch61v4: And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
ch61v5: And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
ch61v6: 'But ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.'
ch61v7: 'For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.'
ch61v8: For I the Lord love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
ch61v9: 'And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed.'
ch61v10: I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
ch61v11: For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

ch63v1: Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
ch63v2: Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?
ch63v3: 'I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.'
ch63v4: For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.
ch63v5: 'And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.'
ch63v6: And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.
ch63v7: I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the Lord, and the praises of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.

ch63v11: Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?
ch63v12: That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?
ch63v13: That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?
ch63v14: 'As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.'

ch64v1: Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,
ch64v2: As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!
ch64v3: When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.
ch64v4: For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
ch64v5: 'Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.'
ch64v6: But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
ch64v7: 'And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.'

ch65v1: 'I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.'
ch65v2: I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;
ch65v3: A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;
ch65v4: Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
ch65v5: Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
ch65v6: 'Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,'
ch65v7: 'Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the Lord, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.'
ch65v8: 'Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants'' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.'
ch65v9: 'And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.'
ch65v10: And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
ch65v11: But ye are they that forsake the Lord, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.
ch65v12: 'Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.'
ch65v13: 'Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:'
ch65v14: Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
ch65v15: 'And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:'
ch65v16: That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
ch65v17: 'For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.'
ch65v18: 'But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.'

ch65v20: 'There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.'
ch65v21: And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
ch65v22: 'They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.'
ch65v23: They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.
ch65v24: And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
ch65v25: 'The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent''s meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.'

ch66v1: 'Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?'
ch66v2: 'For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.'
ch66v3: He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.
ch66v4: 'I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.'
ch66v5: 'Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name''s sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.'
ch66v6: A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies.
ch66v7: Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.
ch66v8: Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
ch66v9: 'Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.'
ch66v10: 'Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:'
ch66v11: That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
ch66v12: 'For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.'
ch66v13: As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
ch66v14: 'And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the Lord shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.'
ch66v15: For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
ch66v16: 'For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many.'
ch66v17: They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.
ch66v18: 'For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.'
ch66v19: And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
ch66v20: And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord.
ch66v21: And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the Lord.
ch66v22: For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain.
ch66v23: And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord.
ch66v24: 'And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.'
