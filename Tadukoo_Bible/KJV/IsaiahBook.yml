  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem
    in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. &l2&rHear,
    O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and'
  '2': 'brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. &l3&rThe ox knoweth
    his owner, and the ass his master''s crib: but Israel doth not know, my people
    doth not consider. &l4&rAh sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed
    of evildoers, children'
  '3': 'that are corrupters: they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy
    One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward. &l5&rWhy should ye be stricken
    any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole
    heart faint.'
  '4': '&l6&rFrom the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in
    it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed,
    neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment. &l7&rYour country is desolate,
    your cities are'
  '5': 'burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it
    is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. &l8&rAnd the daughter of Zion is left
    as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged
    city. &l9&rExcept the'
  '6': Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah. &l10&rHear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. &l11&rTo what
  '7': 'purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord: I am
    full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight
    not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. &l12&rWhen ye come
    to appear before me, who'
  '8': hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? &l13&rBring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. &l14&rYour new
  '9': 'moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me;
    I am weary to bear them. &l15&rAnd when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide
    mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands
    are full of blood.'
  '10': '&l16&rWash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before
    mine eyes; cease to do evil; &l17&rLearn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the
    oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. &l18&rCome now, and let
    us reason together,'
  '11': 'saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as
    snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. &l19&rIf ye be willing
    and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: &l20&rBut if ye refuse and rebel,
    ye shall be'
  '12': 'devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. &l21&rHow
    is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness
    lodged in it; but now murderers. &l22&rThy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed
    with water:'
  '13': '&l23&rThy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth
    gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth
    the cause of the widow come unto them. &l24&rTherefore saith the Lord, the Lord
    of hosts, the'
  '14': 'mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge
    me of mine enemies: &l25&rAnd I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge
    away thy dross, and take away all thy tin: &l26&rAnd I will restore thy judges
    as at the first, and thy'
  '15': 'counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city
    of righteousness, the faithful city. &l27&rZion shall be redeemed with judgment,
    and her converts with righteousness. &l28&rAnd the destruction of the transgressors
    and of the'
  '16': sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed. &l29&rFor they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. &l30&rFor ye shall be as an oak whose leaf
  '17': fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water. &l31&rAnd the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.
  '18': 'Chapter 2

    The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. &l2&rAnd
    it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord''s house
    shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the'
  '19': 'hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. &l3&rAnd many people shall go
    and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of
    the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:
    for out of Zion'
  '20': 'shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. &l4&rAnd
    he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall
    beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation
    shall not lift up sword'
  '21': against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. &l5&rO house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord. &l6&rTherefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers
  '22': 'like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
    &l7&rTheir land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their
    treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their
    chariots:'
  '23': '&l8&rTheir land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own
    hands, that which their own fingers have made: &l9&rAnd the mean man boweth down,
    and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not. &l10&rEnter into
    the rock, and hide'
  '24': thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty. &l11&rThe lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. &l12&rFor the day of the Lord of hosts
  '25': 'shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that
    is lifted up; and he shall be brought low: &l13&rAnd upon all the cedars of Lebanon,
    that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, &l14&rAnd upon all
    the high'
  '26': mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up, &l15&rAnd upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, &l16&rAnd upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. &l17&rAnd the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the
  '27': 'haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the Lord alone shall be exalted
    in that day. &l18&rAnd the idols he shall utterly abolish. &l19&rAnd they shall
    go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the
    Lord, and for the'
  '28': glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. &l20&rIn that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; &l21&rTo go into the clefts of
  '29': 'the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the Lord, and
    for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. &l22&rCease
    ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted
    of ?'
  '30': 'Chapter 3

    For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from
    Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.
    &l2&rThe mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the'
  '31': prudent, and the ancient, &l3&rThe captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. &l4&rAnd I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. &l5&rAnd the people
  '32': 'shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour:
    the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against
    the honourable. &l6&rWhen a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of
    his father, saying,'
  '33': 'Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:
    &l7&rIn that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house
    is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people. &l8&rFor Jerusalem
    is ruined,'
  '34': 'and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the
    Lord, to provoke the eyes of his glory. &l9&rThe shew of their countenance doth
    witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe
    unto their soul! for'
  '35': 'they have rewarded evil unto themselves. &l10&rSay ye to the righteous, that
    it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. &l11&rWoe
    unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be
    given him.'
  '36': '&l12&rAs for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over
    them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way
    of thy paths. &l13&rThe Lord standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.
    &l14&rThe Lord'
  '37': 'will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes
    thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
    &l15&rWhat mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the
    poor? saith the'
  '38': 'Lord God of hosts. &l16&rMoreover the Lord saith, Because the daughters of
    Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking
    and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: &l17&rTherefore
    the Lord will smite'
  '39': with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will discover their secret parts. &l18&rIn that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the
  '40': moon, &l19&rThe chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, &l20&rThe bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, &l21&rThe rings, and nose jewels, &l22&rThe changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles,
  '41': and the wimples, and the crisping pins, &l23&rThe glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. &l24&rAnd it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair
  '42': baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty. &l25&rThy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. &l26&rAnd her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.
  '43': 'Chapter 4

    And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our
    own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take
    away our reproach. &l2&rIn that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful
    and'
  '44': glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel. &l3&rAnd it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written
  '45': 'among the living in Jerusalem: &l4&rWhen the Lord shall have washed away
    the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem
    from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
    &l5&rAnd the Lord will'
  '46': 'create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies,
    a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon
    all the glory shall be a defence. &l6&rAnd there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow
    in the day time from'
  '47': the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.
  '48': 'Chapter 5

    Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard.
    My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: &l2&rAnd he fenced it,
    and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and
    built a'
  '49': 'tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked
    that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. &l3&rAnd
    now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt
    me and my vineyard.'
  '50': '&l4&rWhat could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done
    in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it
    forth wild grapes?'

    &l5&rAnd now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take
    away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof,
    and it shall be trodden down: &l6&rAnd I will lay it waste: it shall not be'
  '2': 'pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also
    command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. &l7&rFor the vineyard of the
    Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:
    and he looked for'
  '3': judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry. &l8&rWoe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth! &l9&rIn mine ears said the Lord of
  '4': hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant. &l10&rYea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah. &l11&rWoe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they
  '5': 'may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!

    &l14&rTherefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure:

    into it. &l15&rAnd the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall
    be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled: &l16&rBut the Lord of
    hosts shall be'

  '9': 'sin as it were with a cart rope: &l19&rThat say, Let him make speed, and hasten
    his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw
    nigh and come, that we may know it! &l20&rWoe unto them that call evil good, and
    good evil;'

  '11': 'strength to mingle strong drink: &l23&rWhich justify the wicked for reward,

    the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root
    shall be as'

    away the law of the Lord of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
    &l25&rTherefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath
    stretched forth'
  '13': 'his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble,
    and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger
    is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. &l26&rAnd he will lift
    up an ensign to the'
  '14': 'nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and,
    behold, they shall come with speed swiftly: &l27&rNone shall be weary nor stumble
    among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins
    be loosed, nor the'

    bows bent, their horses'' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels
    like a whirlwind: &l29&rTheir roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like
    young lions: yea,'
  '16': 'they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe,
    and none shall deliver it. &l30&rAnd in that day they shall roar against them
    like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and

  '18': 'Chapter 6

    In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high
    and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. &l2&rAbove it stood the seraphims:
    each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered'
  '19': 'his feet, and with twain he did fly. &l3&rAnd one cried unto another, and
    said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
    &l4&rAnd the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house
    was filled with'
  '20': 'smoke. &l5&rThen said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of
    unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes
    have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. &l6&rThen flew one of the seraphims unto
    me, having a live'
  '21': 'coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: &l7&rAnd
    he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine
    iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. &l8&rAlso I heard the voice of the
    Lord, saying, Whom'
  '22': shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. &l9&rAnd he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. &l10&rMake the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy,
  '23': and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. &l11&rThen said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses
  '24': 'without man, and the land be utterly desolate, &l12&rAnd the Lord have removed
    men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. &l13&rBut
    yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil
    tree, and as an'
  '25': 'oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy
    seed shall be the substance thereof.'
  '26': 'Chapter 7

    And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah,
    king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king
    of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against'
  '27': it. &l2&rAnd it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind. &l3&rThen said the Lord unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz,
  '28': thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field; &l4&rAnd say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce
  '29': anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. &l5&rBecause Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying, &l6&rLet us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king
  '30': 'in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal: &l7&rThus saith the Lord God,
    It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass. &l8&rFor the head of Syria
    is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five
    years shall Ephraim be'
  '31': broken, that it be not a people. &l9&rAnd the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established. &l10&rMoreover the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying, &l11&rAsk thee a sign of
  '32': the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above. &l12&rBut Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. &l13&rAnd he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God
  '33': also? &l14&rTherefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. &l15&rButter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. &l16&rFor before
  '34': the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings. &l17&rThe Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day
  '35': that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria. &l18&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. &l19&rAnd
  '36': they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes. &l20&rIn the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the
  '37': 'king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume
    the beard. &l21&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish
    a young cow, and two sheep; &l22&rAnd it shall come to pass, for the abundance
    of milk that they'
  '38': 'shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat
    that is left in the land. &l23&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that every
    place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it
    shall even be for'
  '39': 'briers and thorns. &l24&rWith arrows and with bows shall men come thither;
    because all the land shall become briers and thorns. &l25&rAnd on all hills that
    shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers
    and thorns: but it'
  '40': shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.
  '41': 'Chapter 8

    Moreover the Lord said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a
    man''s pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz. &l2&rAnd I took unto me faithful witnesses
    to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. &l3&rAnd I
    went'
  '42': unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the Lord to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz. &l4&rFor before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be
  '43': taken away before the king of Assyria. &l5&rThe Lord spake also unto me again, saying, &l6&rForasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son; &l7&rNow therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up
  '44': 'upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria,
    and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all
    his banks: &l8&rAnd he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over,
    he shall reach even'
  '45': 'to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of
    thy land, O Immanuel. &l9&rAssociate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be
    broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and
    ye shall be broken in'
  '46': 'pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. &l10&rTake counsel
    together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand:
    for God is with us. &l11&rFor the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and
    instructed me that'
  '47': I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, &l12&rSay ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. &l13&rSanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear,
  '48': and let him be your dread. &l14&rAnd he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. &l15&rAnd many among them shall stumble, and
  '49': fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken. &l16&rBind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. &l17&rAnd I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. &l18&rBehold, I and the children
  '50': whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.

    &l19&rAnd when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits,
    and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their
    God? for the living to the dead? &l20&rTo the law and to the testimony: if'
  '2': 'they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in
    them. &l21&rAnd they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it
    shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves,
    and curse their king and'
  '3': their God, and look upward. &l22&rAnd they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.
  '4': 'Chapter 9

    Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the
    first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward
    did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee'
  '5': 'of the nations. &l2&rThe people that walked in darkness have seen a great
    light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the
    light shined. &l3&rThou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy:
    they joy before thee'
  '6': according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. &l4&rFor thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian. &l5&rFor every battle of the warrior is with
  '7': 'confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning
    and fuel of fire. &l6&rFor unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and
    the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful,
    Counsellor, The'
  '8': mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. &l7&rOf the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth
  '9': even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. &l8&rThe Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. &l9&rAnd all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of
  '10': 'heart, &l10&rThe bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones:
    the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars. &l11&rTherefore
    the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies
    together;'
  '11': '&l12&rThe Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour
    Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand
    is stretched out still. &l13&rFor the people turneth not unto him that smiteth
    them, neither do they'
  '12': seek the Lord of hosts. &l14&rTherefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day. &l15&rThe ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. &l16&rFor the leaders of this people
  '13': 'cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed. &l17&rTherefore
    the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their
    fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every
    mouth speaketh'
  '14': 'folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched
    out still. &l18&rFor wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers
    and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount
    up like the lifting'
  '15': 'up of smoke. &l19&rThrough the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened,
    and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.
    &l20&rAnd he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on
    the left hand,'
  '16': 'and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his
    own arm: &l21&rManasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall
    be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched
    out still.'
  '17': 'Chapter 10

    Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which
    they have prescribed; &l2&rTo turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take
    away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and
    that'
  '18': they may rob the fatherless! &l3&rAnd what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory? &l4&rWithout me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and
  '19': they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. &l5&rO Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation. &l6&rI will send him against an hypocritical nation,
  '20': and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. &l7&rHowbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy
  '21': and cut off nations not a few. &l8&rFor he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings? &l9&rIs not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus? &l10&rAs my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did
  '22': excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; &l11&rShall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? &l12&rWherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on
  '23': 'Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria,
    and the glory of his high looks. &l13&rFor he saith, By the strength of my hand
    I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds
    of the people,'
  '24': 'and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like
    a valiant man: &l14&rAnd my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people:
    and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there
    was none that moved'
  '25': the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped. &l15&rShall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff
  '26': should lift up itself, as if it were no wood. &l16&rTherefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire. &l17&rAnd the light of Israel shall be for a fire,
  '27': 'and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and
    his briers in one day; &l18&rAnd shall consume the glory of his forest, and of
    his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer
    fainteth. &l19&rAnd'
  '28': the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them. &l20&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but
  '29': 'shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. &l21&rThe remnant
    shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God. &l22&rFor though
    thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return:
    the consumption'
  '30': decreed shall overflow with righteousness. &l23&rFor the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land. &l24&rTherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the
  '31': 'Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against
    thee, after the manner of Egypt. &l25&rFor yet a very little while, and the indignation
    shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction. &l26&rAnd the Lord of hosts
    shall stir'
  '32': 'up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of
    Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner
    of Egypt. &l27&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be
    taken away from off thy'
  '33': 'shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed
    because of the anointing. &l28&rHe is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at
    Michmash he hath laid up his carriages: &l29&rThey are gone over the passage:
    they have taken up their'
  '34': 'lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled. &l30&rLift up thy
    voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.
    &l31&rMadmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.
    &l32&rAs yet shall he'
  '35': 'remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the
    daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. &l33&rBehold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts,
    shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down,
    and the haughty'
  '36': shall be humbled. &l34&rAnd he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
  '37': 'Chapter 11

    And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall
    grow out of his roots: &l2&rAnd the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the
    spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit
    of'
  '38': 'knowledge and of the fear of the Lord; &l3&rAnd shall make him of quick understanding
    in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither
    reprove after the hearing of his ears: &l4&rBut with righteousness shall he judge
    the'
  '39': 'poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite
    the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he
    slay the wicked. &l5&rAnd righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
    faithfulness the girdle'
  '40': of his reins. &l6&rThe wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. &l7&rAnd the cow and the bear shall feed; their young
  '41': 'ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. &l8&rAnd
    the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall
    put his hand on the cockatrice'' den. &l9&rThey shall not hurt nor destroy in
    all my holy'
  '42': 'mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the
    waters cover the sea. &l10&rAnd in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which
    shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his
    rest shall be'
  '43': glorious. &l11&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from
  '44': Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. &l12&rAnd he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. &l13&rThe envy also of
  '45': 'Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim
    shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim. &l14&rBut they shall fly
    upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of
    the east together:'
  '46': they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them. &l15&rAnd the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the
  '47': seven streams, and make men go over dryshod. &l16&rAnd there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

  '17': of beauty, unto the residue of his people, &l6&rAnd for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate. &l7&rBut they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the
  '18': way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment. &l8&rFor all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there
  '19': is no place clean. &l9&rWhom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. &l10&rFor precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon

    they would not hear.'

    upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little;
    that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken. &l14&rWherefore
    hear'
  '22': the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem. &l15&rBecause ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto
  '23': 'us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:

    forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and
    by night: and it'
  '26': 'shall be a vexation only to understand the report. &l20&rFor the bed is shorter
    than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that
    he can wrap himself in it. &l21&rFor the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim,
    he shall be'

    and bring to pass his act, his strange act. &l22&rNow therefore be ye not mockers,
    lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a
    consumption, even'
  '28': determined upon the whole earth. &l23&rGive ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech. &l24&rDoth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground? &l25&rWhen he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast
  '29': abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place? &l26&rFor his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him. &l27&rFor the fitches are not threshed with a threshing
  '30': instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod. &l28&rBread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor
  '31': bruise it with his horsemen. &l29&rThis also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.

  '22': 'Chapter 36

    Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib
    king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.
    &l2&rAnd the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king'
  '23': Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field. &l3&rThen came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
  '24': '&l4&rAnd Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the
    great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
    &l5&rI say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength
    for war: now on'
  '25': 'whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? &l6&rLo, thou trustest
    in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go
    into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in
    him. &l7&rBut if thou'
  '26': 'say to me, We trust in the Lord our God: is it not he, whose high places
    and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem,
    Ye shall worship before this altar? &l8&rNow therefore give pledges, I pray thee,
    to my master the king'
  '27': of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. &l9&rHow then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for
  '28': horsemen? &l10&rAnd am I now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it? the Lord said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it. &l11&rThen said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the
  '29': 'Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews''
    language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall. &l12&rBut Rabshakeh
    said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath
    he not sent me to the'
  '30': men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you? &l13&rThen Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. &l14&rThus
  '31': 'saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to
    deliver you. &l15&rNeither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, The
    Lord will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of
    the king of Assyria.'
  '32': '&l16&rHearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an
    agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his
    vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his
    own cistern;'
  '33': '&l17&rUntil I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land
    of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. &l18&rBeware lest Hezekiah persuade
    you, saying, the Lord will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered
    his land out'
  '34': of the hand of the king of Assyria? &l19&rWhere are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? &l20&rWho are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of
  '35': 'my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? &l21&rBut
    they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king''s commandment
    was, saying, Answer him not. &l22&rThen came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that
    was over the household,'
  '36': and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
  '37': 'Chapter 37

    And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and
    covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord. &l2&rAnd
    he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders
    of'
  '38': 'the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
    &l3&rAnd they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble,
    and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there
    is not strength'
  '39': 'to bring forth. &l4&rIt may be the Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
    whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and
    will reprove the words which the Lord thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy
    prayer for the'
  '40': remnant that is left. &l5&rSo the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. &l6&rAnd Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of
  '41': Assyria have blasphemed me. &l7&rBehold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. &l8&rSo Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
  '42': 'against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. &l9&rAnd
    he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war
    with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, &l10&rThus
    shall ye speak'
  '43': to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. &l11&rBehold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying
  '44': them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? &l12&rHave the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar? &l13&rWhere is the king of Hamath, and the king
  '45': 'of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? &l14&rAnd
    Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and
    Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord. &l15&rAnd
    Hezekiah'
  '46': 'prayed unto the Lord, saying, &l16&rO Lord of hosts, God of Israel, that
    dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the
    kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth. &l17&rIncline thine ear,
    O Lord, and hear; open'
  '47': 'thine eyes, O Lord, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which
    hath sent to reproach the living God. &l18&rOf a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria
    have laid waste all the nations, and their countries, &l19&rAnd have cast their
    gods into the fire:'
  '48': 'for they were no gods, but the work of men''s hands, wood and stone: therefore
    they have destroyed them. &l20&rNow therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his
    hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord, even
    thou only.'
  '49': '&l21&rThen Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith
    the Lord God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king
    of Assyria: &l22&rThis is the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning him;

    you of them. &l10&rSing'
  '21': unto the Lord a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. &l11&rLet the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar
  '22': 'doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the
    top of the mountains. &l12&rLet them give glory unto the Lord, and declare his
    praise in the islands. &l13&rThe Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall
    stir up jealousy like'
  '23': 'a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.
    &l14&rI have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself:
    now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once. &l15&rI
    will make waste'
  '24': 'mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers
    islands, and I will dry up the pools. &l16&rAnd I will bring the blind by a way
    that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will
    make darkness light'
  '25': before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them. &l17&rThey shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods. &l18&rHear, ye
  '26': deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. &l19&rWho is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the Lord's servant? &l20&rSeeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears,
  '27': 'but he heareth not. &l21&rThe Lord is well pleased for his righteousness''
    sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable. &l22&rBut this is a people
    robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in
    prison houses: they'
  '28': are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. &l23&rWho among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come? &l24&rWho gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the Lord, he against
  '29': 'whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they
    obedient unto his law. &l25&rTherefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his

    and'
  '32': 'through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through
    the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
    &l3&rFor I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt
    for thy ransom,'
  '33': 'Ethiopia and Seba for thee. &l4&rSince thou wast precious in my sight, thou
    hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee,

    that I am he:'
  '37': 'before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. &l11&rI,
    even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. &l12&rI have declared,
    and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore
    ye are my'

    am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who
    shall let it? &l14&rThus saith the Lord, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;
    For your sake I have'
  '39': sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. &l15&rI am the Lord, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King. &l16&rThus saith the Lord, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty
  '40': 'waters; &l17&rWhich bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the
    power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they
    are quenched as tow. &l18&rRemember ye not the former things, neither consider
    the things of old.'
  '41': '&l19&rBehold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye
    not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
    &l20&rThe beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because
    I give waters in the'
  '42': wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen. &l21&rThis people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise. &l22&rBut thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel. &l23&rThou
  '43': hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense. &l24&rThou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither
  '44': 'hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me
    to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities. &l25&rI, even
    I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not
    remember thy sins.'
  '45': '&l26&rPut me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou
    mayest be justified. &l27&rThy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have
    transgressed against me. &l28&rTherefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary,

    Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen: &l2&rThus saith

    are in'
  '35': 'their paths. &l8&rThe way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment
    in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall

    us: we wait'

    &l10&rWe grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes:
    we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.
    &l11&rWe roar all like'

    for salvation, but it is far off from us. &l12&rFor our transgressions are multiplied
    before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with
    us; and as for'
  '38': our iniquities, we know them; &l13&rIn transgressing and lying against the Lord, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. &l14&rAnd judgment is turned away backward, and
  '39': 'justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity
    cannot enter. &l15&rYea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh
    himself a prey: and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.
    &l16&rAnd he saw'
  '40': 'that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore
    his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. &l17&rFor
    he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his
    head; and he'

  '43': from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord. &l21&rAs for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor
  '44': out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.

  '1': 'Chapter 65 Cont.

    &l9&rAnd I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor
    of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell
    there. &l10&rAnd Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place'
  '2': for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. &l11&rBut ye are they that forsake the Lord, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number. &l12&rTherefore will I
  '3': 'number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because
    when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil
    before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not. &l13&rTherefore
    thus saith the Lord'
  '4': 'God, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants
    shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye
    shall be ashamed: &l14&rBehold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye
    shall cry for'
  '5': 'sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. &l15&rAnd ye shall
    leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord God shall slay thee,
    and call his servants by another name: &l16&rThat he who blesseth himself in the
    earth shall bless'
  '6': 'himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear
    by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they
    are hid from mine eyes. &l17&rFor, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth:
    and the former'
  '7': 'shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. &l18&rBut be ye glad and rejoice
    for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing,
    and her people a joy. &l19&rAnd I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people:
    and the voice of'
  '8': 'weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. &l20&rThere
    shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled
    his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an
    hundred years old'
  '9': 'shall be accursed. &l21&rAnd they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and
    they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. &l22&rThey shall not build,
    and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of
    a tree are the'
  '10': days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. &l23&rThey shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them. &l24&rAnd it shall come to pass,
  '11': 'that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I
    will hear. &l25&rThe wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
    eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent''s meat. They shall
    not hurt nor destroy in all'
  '12': my holy mountain, saith the Lord.
  '13': 'Chapter 66

    Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where
    is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest? &l2&rFor
    all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the'
  '14': 'Lord: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite
    spirit, and trembleth at my word. &l3&rHe that killeth an ox is as if he slew
    a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog''s neck; he that offereth
    an oblation, as'
  '15': if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations. &l4&rI also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because
  '16': 'when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they
    did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not. &l5&rHear
    the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you,
    that cast you out for'

    your joy, and they shall be ashamed. &l6&rA voice of noise from the city, a voice
    from the temple, a voice of the Lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies.
    &l7&rBefore she'
  '18': travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child. &l8&rWho hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion
  '19': 'travailed, she brought forth her children. &l9&rShall I bring to the birth,
    and not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord: shall I cause to bring forth, and
    shut the womb? saith thy God. &l10&rRejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with
    her, all ye that'
  '20': 'love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: &l11&rThat
    ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may
    milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. &l12&rFor thus saith
    the Lord, Behold, I'
  '21': 'will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like
    a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be
    dandled upon her knees. &l13&rAs one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort
    you; and ye shall be'
  '22': 'comforted in Jerusalem. &l14&rAnd when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice,
    and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the Lord shall be
    known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies. &l15&rFor,
    behold, the Lord will'
  '23': 'come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger
    with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. &l16&rFor by fire and by his sword
    will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many. &l17&rThey
    that'
  '24': 'sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree
    in the midst, eating swine''s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall
    be consumed together, saith the Lord. &l18&rFor I know their works and their thoughts:
    it shall come,'
  '25': that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory. &l19&rAnd I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the
  '26': isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles. &l20&rAnd they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in
  '27': litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord. &l21&rAnd I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith
  '28': the Lord. &l22&rFor as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain. &l23&rAnd it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to
  '29': 'another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. &l24&rAnd
    they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed
    against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched;
    and they shall'
  '30': be an abhorring unto all flesh.
