  '1': 'Chapter 1

    James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which
    are scattered abroad, greeting. &l2&rMy brethren, count it all joy when ye fall
    into divers temptations; &l3&rKnowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh'
  '2': patience. &l4&rBut let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. &l5&rIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. &l6&rBut let him
  '3': ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. &l7&rFor let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. &l8&rA double minded man is unstable in all his ways. &l9&rLet the
  '4': 'brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: &l10&rBut the rich, in
    that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. &l11&rFor
    the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and
    the flower'
  '5': 'thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall
    the rich man fade away in his ways. &l12&rBlessed is the man that endureth temptation:
    for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath
    promised to'
  '6': 'them that love him. &l13&rLet no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted
    of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: &l14&rBut
    every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. &l15&rThen
    when lust'
  '7': 'hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth
    forth death. &l16&rDo not err, my beloved brethren. &l17&rEvery good gift and
    every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with
    whom is no'
  '8': 'variableness, neither shadow of turning. &l18&rOf his own will begat he us
    with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
    &l19&rWherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to
    speak, slow to wrath:'
  '9': ' &l20&rFor the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. &l21&rWherefore
    lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness
    the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. &l22&rBut be ye doers of
    the word,'
  '10': 'and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. &l23&rFor if any be a hearer
    of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face
    in a glass: &l24&rFor he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
    forgetteth what'
  '11': manner of man he was. &l25&rBut whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. &l26&rIf any man among you seem to be religious, and
  '12': bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain. &l27&rPure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.
  '13': 'Chapter 2

    My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with
    respect of persons. &l2&rFor if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold
    ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; &l3&rAnd'
  '14': 'ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit
    thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here
    under my footstool: &l4&rAre ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become
    judges of evil'
  '15': thoughts? &l5&rHearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? &l6&rBut ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you
  '16': 'before the judgment seats? &l7&rDo not they blaspheme that worthy name by
    the which ye are called? &l8&rIf ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture,
    Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: &l9&rBut if ye have respect
    to persons, ye'
  '17': commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. &l10&rFor whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. &l11&rFor he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no
  '18': adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. &l12&rSo speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. &l13&rFor he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against
  '19': judgment. &l14&rWhat doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? &l15&rIf a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, &l16&rAnd one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed
  '20': 'and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful
    to the body; what doth it profit? &l17&rEven so faith, if it hath not works, is
    dead, being alone. &l18&rYea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works:
    shew me thy faith'
  '21': 'without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. &l19&rThou
    believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and
    tremble. &l20&rBut wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
    &l21&rWas not Abraham'
  '22': our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? &l22&rSeest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? &l23&rAnd the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was
  '23': 'imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
    &l24&rYe see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
    &l25&rLikewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had
    received the messengers,'
  '24': and had sent them out another way? &l26&rFor as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
  '25': 'Chapter 3

    My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
    &l2&rFor in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same
    is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body. &l3&rBehold, we put'
  '26': bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. &l4&rBehold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor
  '27': 'listeth. &l5&rEven so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
    Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! &l6&rAnd the tongue is a fire,
    a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the
    whole body, and'
  '28': 'setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. &l7&rFor
    every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea,
    is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: &l8&rBut the tongue can no man tame;
    it is an unruly'
  '29': evil, full of deadly poison. &l9&rTherewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. &l10&rOut of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
  '30': '&l11&rDoth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
    &l12&rCan the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs?
    so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. &l13&rWho is a wise man and
    endued with knowledge'
  '31': among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. &l14&rBut if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. &l15&rThis wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly,
  '32': sensual, devilish. &l16&rFor where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. &l17&rBut the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality,
  '33': and without hypocrisy. &l18&rAnd the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
  '34': 'Chapter 4

    From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your
    lusts that war in your members? &l2&rYe lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire
    to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask
    not.'
  '35': '&l3&rYe ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it
    upon your lusts. &l4&rYe adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship
    of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world
    is the enemy'
  '36': of God. &l5&rDo ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? &l6&rBut he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. &l7&rSubmit yourselves therefore to
  '37': 'God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. &l8&rDraw nigh to God,
    and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your
    hearts, ye double minded. &l9&rBe afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter
    be turned to'
  '38': mourning, and your joy to heaviness. &l10&rHumble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. &l11&rSpeak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and
  '39': 'judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law,
    but a judge. &l12&rThere is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy:
    who art thou that judgest another? &l13&rGo to now, ye that say, To day or to
    morrow we will go into'
  '40': 'such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: &l14&rWhereas
    ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour,
    that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. &l15&rFor that ye ought
    to'
  '41': 'say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that. &l16&rBut now
    ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. &l17&rTherefore to him
    that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.'
  '42': 'Chapter 5

    Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.
    &l2&rYour riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. &l3&rYour gold
    and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and'
  '43': 'shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for
    the last days. &l4&rBehold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
    fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which
    have reaped are'
  '44': entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. &l5&rYe have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. &l6&rYe have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you. &l7&rBe patient
  '45': 'therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman
    waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until
    he receive the early and latter rain. &l8&rBe ye also patient; stablish your hearts:
    for the coming'
  '46': 'of the Lord draweth nigh. &l9&rGrudge not one against another, brethren,
    lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. &l10&rTake,
    my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example
    of suffering'
  '47': affliction, and of patience. &l11&rBehold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. &l12&rBut above all things, my brethren, swear not,
  '48': 'neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let
    your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation. &l13&rIs any
    among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms. &l14&rIs
    any sick among you?'
  '49': 'let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing
    him with oil in the name of the Lord: &l15&rAnd the prayer of faith shall save
    the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they
    shall be forgiven'
  '50': him. &l16&rConfess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

    &l17&rElias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly
    that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years
    and six months. &l18&rAnd he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and'
  '2': the earth brought forth her fruit. &l19&rBrethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; &l20&rLet him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
