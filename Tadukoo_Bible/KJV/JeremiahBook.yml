  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth
    in the land of Benjamin: &l2&rTo whom the word of the Lord came in the days of
    Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. &l3&rIt
    came'
  '2': also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. &l4&rThen the word of the Lord came unto me,
  '3': 'saying, &l5&rBefore I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou
    camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet
    unto the nations. &l6&rThen said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for
    I am a child. &l7&rBut'
  '4': 'the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that
    I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. &l8&rBe not
    afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord. &l9&rThen
    the Lord put'
  '5': forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. &l10&rSee, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to
  '6': 'build, and to plant. &l11&rMoreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
    Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree. &l12&rThen
    said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform
    it. &l13&rAnd'
  '7': the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north. &l14&rThen the Lord said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of
  '8': the land. &l15&rFor, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the Lord; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and
  '9': against all the cities of Judah. &l16&rAnd I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands. &l17&rThou therefore gird up thy
  '10': 'loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed
    at their faces, lest I confound thee before them. &l18&rFor, behold, I have made
    thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the
    whole land,'
  '11': against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. &l19&rAnd they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.
  '12': 'Chapter 2

    Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, &l2&rGo and cry in the ears
    of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord; I remember thee, the kindness of thy
    youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness,
    in a'
  '13': 'land that was not sown. &l3&rIsrael was holiness unto the Lord, and the firstfruits
    of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them,
    saith the Lord. &l4&rHear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the
    families of'
  '14': 'the house of Israel: &l5&rThus saith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers
    found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and
    are become vain? &l6&rNeither said they, Where is the Lord that brought us up
    out of the land of'
  '15': Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt? &l7&rAnd I brought you into a plentiful country, to
  '16': 'eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled
    my land, and made mine heritage an abomination. &l8&rThe priests said not, Where
    is the Lord? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed
    against'
  '17': me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit. &l9&rWherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the Lord, and with your children's children will I plead. &l10&rFor pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto
  '18': Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing. &l11&rHath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit. &l12&rBe astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be
  '19': horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the Lord. &l13&rFor my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. &l14&rIs Israel a servant? is he
  '20': 'a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled? &l15&rThe young lions roared upon him,
    and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.
    &l16&rAlso the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.
    &l17&rHast thou'
  '21': not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way? &l18&rAnd now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the
  '22': 'waters of the river? &l19&rThine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy
    backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing
    and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not
    in thee, saith the'
  '23': Lord God of hosts. &l20&rFor of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot. &l21&rYet I had planted thee a noble
  '24': 'vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant
    of a strange vine unto me? &l22&rFor though thou wash thee with nitre, and take
    thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord God. &l23&rHow
    canst thou'
  '25': 'say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the
    valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
    &l24&rA wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure;
    in her occasion'
  '26': 'who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves;
    in her month they shall find her. &l25&rWithhold thy foot from being unshod, and
    thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved
    strangers, and after'
  '27': them will I go. &l26&rAs the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets. &l27&rSaying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me
  '28': 'forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in
    the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us. &l28&rBut where are
    thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the
    time of thy trouble:'
  '29': 'for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah. &l29&rWherefore
    will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the Lord. &l30&rIn
    vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword
    hath'
  '30': devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion. &l31&rO generation, see ye the word of the Lord. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee? &l32&rCan a maid forget her
  '31': ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number. &l33&rWhy trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways. &l34&rAlso in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the
  '32': 'poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.
    &l35&rYet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from
    me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned. &l36&rWhy
    gaddest thou'
  '33': 'about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as
    thou wast ashamed of Assyria. &l37&rYea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine
    hands upon thine head: for the Lord hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt
    not prosper in them.'
  '34': 'Chapter 3

    They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another
    man''s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted?
    but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith
    the'
  '35': Lord. &l2&rLift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness. &l3&rTherefore
  '36': the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed. &l4&rWilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth? &l5&rWill he reserve his anger
  '37': for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest. &l6&rThe Lord said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high
  '38': mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot. &l7&rAnd I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. &l8&rAnd I saw, when for all the causes whereby
  '39': backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also. &l9&rAnd it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled
  '40': the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks. &l10&rAnd yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the Lord. &l11&rAnd the Lord said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath
  '41': 'justified herself more than treacherous Judah. &l12&rGo and proclaim these
    words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord;
    and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the
    Lord, and I will not'
  '42': keep anger for ever. &l13&rOnly acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the Lord. &l14&rTurn, O
  '43': 'backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you: and I will
    take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion: &l15&rAnd
    I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge
    and'
  '44': 'understanding. &l16&rAnd it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and
    increased in the land, in those days, saith the Lord, they shall say no more,
    The ark of the covenant of the Lord: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall
    they remember it;'
  '45': 'neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more. &l17&rAt
    that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord; and all the nations
    shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the Lord, to Jerusalem: neither shall
    they walk any more'
  '46': after the imagination of their evil heart. &l18&rIn those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers. &l19&rBut I
  '47': said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me. &l20&rSurely as a wife treacherously departeth from her
  '48': 'husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith
    the Lord. &l21&rA voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications
    of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten
    the Lord their'
  '49': 'God. &l22&rReturn, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.
    Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the Lord our God. &l23&rTruly in vain
    is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly
    in the Lord our'

    If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return unto me: and if thou wilt
    put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove. &l2&rAnd
    thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness;
    and'
  '3': the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory. &l3&rFor thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. &l4&rCircumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the
  '4': 'foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest
    my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the

  '8': I, Ah, Lord God! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul. &l11&rAt that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the
  '9': 'wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse, &l12&rEven
    a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence

    &l14&rO Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved.
    How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? &l15&rFor a voice declareth
    from Dan, and'
  '11': publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim. &l16&rMake ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah. &l17&rAs keepers of a field, are they against
  '12': her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the Lord. &l18&rThy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart. &l19&rMy bowels, my bowels!
  '13': 'I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold
    my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm
    of war. &l20&rDestruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled:
    suddenly are my'
  '14': 'tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment. &l21&rHow long shall I see the
    standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet? &l22&rFor my people is foolish, they
    have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding:
    they are wise to do'
  '15': evil, but to do good they have no knowledge. &l23&rI beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. &l24&rI beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. &l25&rI beheld,
  '16': and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. &l26&rI beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by his fierce anger. &l27&rFor thus hath the
  '17': Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end. &l28&rFor this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.
  '18': '&l29&rThe whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen;
    they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be
    forsaken, and not a man dwell therein. &l30&rAnd when thou art spoiled, what wilt
    thou do? Though thou'
  '19': clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life. &l31&rFor I have heard a voice as of a
  '20': woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.
  '21': 'Chapter 5

    Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and

    hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made
    their faces harder'

    are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment
    of their God. &l5&rI will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them;
    for they have'
  '24': 'known the way of the Lord, and the judgment of their God: but these have

    that are no gods: when I'
  '26': 'had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves
    by troops in the harlots'' houses. &l8&rThey were as fed horses in the morning:

    things? saith the'

    ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements;
    for they are not the Lord''s. &l11&rFor the house of Israel and the house of Judah
    have dealt'
  '28': 'very treacherously against me, saith the Lord. &l12&rThey have belied the
    Lord, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we
    see sword nor famine: &l13&rAnd the prophets shall become wind, and the word is
    not in them: thus'
  '29': shall it be done unto them. &l14&rWherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them. &l15&rLo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O
  '30': 'house of Israel, saith the Lord: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient
    nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they
    say. &l16&rTheir quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men. &l17&rAnd
    they shall eat up'
  '31': 'thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat:
    they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and
    thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst,
    with the sword.'
  '32': '&l18&rNevertheless in those days, saith the Lord, I will not make a full
    end with you. &l19&rAnd it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth
    the Lord our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as
    ye have forsaken me,'
  '33': and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not your's. &l20&rDeclare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, &l21&rHear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes,
  '34': 'and see not; which have ears, and hear not: &l22&rFear ye not me? saith the
    Lord: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound
    of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves
    thereof toss'
  '35': themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it? &l23&rBut this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone. &l24&rNeither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the Lord our God, that
  '36': 'giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth
    unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest. &l25&rYour iniquities have turned
    away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you. &l26&rFor
    among my people are'
  '37': 'found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap,
    they catch men. &l27&rAs a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of
    deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. &l28&rThey are waxen
    fat, they shine: yea,'
  '38': 'they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause
    of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
    &l29&rShall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: shall not my soul be
    avenged on such a'
  '39': 'nation as this? &l30&rA wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the
    land; &l31&rThe prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their
    means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?'
  '40': 'Chapter 6

    O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem,
    and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for
    evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction. &l2&rI have likened the'
  '41': daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman. &l3&rThe shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place. &l4&rPrepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go
  '42': up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. &l5&rArise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces. &l6&rFor thus hath the Lord of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against
  '43': 'Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the
    midst of her. &l7&rAs a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her
    wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief
    and wounds. &l8&rBe'
  '44': 'thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make
    thee desolate, a land not inhabited. &l9&rThus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall
    throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer
    into the'
  '45': 'baskets. &l10&rTo whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?
    behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word
    of the Lord is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. &l11&rTherefore
    I am full of the fury'
  '46': 'of the Lord; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children
    abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with
    the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days. &l12&rAnd their
    houses shall be'
  '47': 'turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch
    out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord. &l13&rFor from the
    least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness;
    and from the'
  '48': prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. &l14&rThey have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. &l15&rWere they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were
  '49': 'not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among
    them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the

    &l18&rTherefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.
    &l19&rHear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit
    of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law,'
  '2': but rejected it. &l20&rTo what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me. &l21&rTherefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will lay
  '3': stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish. &l22&rThus saith the Lord, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from
  '4': the sides of the earth. &l23&rThey shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion. &l24&rWe have heard the fame
  '5': 'thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as
    of a woman in travail. &l25&rGo not forth into the field, nor walk by the way;

    gird thee with'

    son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us. &l27&rI

    and try their way.'
  '7': ' &l28&rThey are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are brass

  '11': throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; &l6&rIf ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to
  '12': 'your hurt: &l7&rThen will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land
    that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever. &l8&rBehold, ye trust in lying
    words, that cannot profit. &l9&rWill ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and
    swear falsely, and burn'

  '14': den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the Lord. &l12&rBut go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. &l13&rAnd now, because ye
  '15': have done all these works, saith the Lord, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not; &l14&rTherefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the
  '16': place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. &l15&rAnd I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim. &l16&rTherefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor
  '17': 'prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.

    they will not'
  '24': 'hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer
    thee. &l28&rBut thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the

    is cut off from their'
  '25': 'mouth. &l29&rCut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take
    up a lamentation on high places; for the Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation
    of his wrath. &l30&rFor the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith
    the Lord: they'
  '26': have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it. &l31&rAnd they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them
  '27': 'not, neither came it into my heart. &l32&rTherefore, behold, the days come,
    saith the Lord, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the
    son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till
    there be no place.'
  '28': '&l33&rAnd the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the
    heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away. &l34&rThen

  '33': Lord of hosts. &l4&rMoreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return? &l5&rWhy then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they
  '34': 'refuse to return. &l6&rI hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright:
    no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned
    to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle. &l7&rYea, the stork in the
    heaven knoweth her'

    nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they

  '43': 'the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is
    not the Lord in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger

    the summer is ended,'

    or shall'

  '2': gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee, &l3&rAnd say, Hear ye the word of the Lord, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which
  '3': whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle. &l4&rBecause they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place
  '4': 'with the blood of innocents; &l5&rThey have built also the high places of
    Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded
    not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind: &l6&rTherefore, behold, the days
    come, saith the'
  '5': Lord, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter. &l7&rAnd I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their
  '6': 'enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases
    will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the
    earth. &l8&rAnd I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that
    passeth thereby shall'
  '7': be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof. &l9&rAnd I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their
  '8': enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them. &l10&rThen shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, &l11&rAnd shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as
  '9': 'one breaketh a potter''s vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they
    shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury. &l12&rThus will I do
    unto this place, saith the Lord, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make
    this city as Tophet:'
  '10': '&l13&rAnd the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah,
    shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose
    roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out
    drink offerings unto'
  '11': other gods. &l14&rThen came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the Lord's house; and said to all the people, &l15&rThus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this
  '12': city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.
  '13': 'Chapter 20

    Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house
    of the Lord, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things. &l2&rThen Pashur smote
    Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of'
  '14': Benjamin, which was by the house of the Lord. &l3&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The Lord hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib. &l4&rFor thus saith the
  '15': 'Lord, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends:
    and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold
    it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall
    carry them captive'
  '16': into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword. &l5&rMoreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their
  '17': 'enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
    &l6&rAnd thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity:
    and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried
    there, thou, and all'
  '18': 'thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. &l7&rO Lord, thou hast deceived
    me, and I was deceived; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in
    derision daily, every one mocketh me. &l8&rFor since I spake, I cried out, I cried
    violence and'
  '19': spoil; because the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily. &l9&rThen I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary
  '20': with forbearing, and I could not stay. &l10&rFor I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him,
  '21': 'and we shall take our revenge on him. &l11&rBut the Lord is with me as a
    mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not
    prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting
    confusion shall'
  '22': 'never be forgotten. &l12&rBut, O Lord of hosts, that triest the righteous,
    and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto
    thee have I opened my cause. &l13&rSing unto the Lord, praise ye the Lord: for

    repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;
    &l17&rBecause he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been
    my grave, and her'

  '26': 'Chapter 21

    The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, when king Zedekiah sent unto
    him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest,
    saying, &l2&rEnquire, I pray thee, of the Lord for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king
    of Babylon'
  '27': 'maketh war against us; if so be that the Lord will deal with us according

    unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: &l4&rThus saith the Lord God of Israel;
    Behold, I will turn'
  '28': back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city. &l5&rAnd I myself will fight against you
  '29': 'with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury,
    and in great wrath. &l6&rAnd I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man
    and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence. &l7&rAnd afterward, saith the
    Lord, I will'

  '31': 'hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge
    of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy. &l8&rAnd
    unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I set before you
    the way of life, and'

    return unto me with'
  '37': their whole heart. &l8&rAnd as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the Lord, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in
  '38': 'the land of Egypt: &l9&rAnd I will deliver them to be removed into all the

  '7': shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink. &l29&rFor, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly
  '8': 'unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all
    the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. &l30&rTherefore prophesy
    thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from
    on high, and utter'
  '9': his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. &l31&rA noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a
  '10': controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. &l32&rThus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from
  '11': 'the coasts of the earth. &l33&rAnd the slain of the Lord shall be at that
    day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall
    not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.

  '12': 'shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the
    flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished;
    and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. &l35&rAnd the shepherds shall have no
    way to flee, nor the'
  '13': 'principal of the flock to escape. &l36&rA voice of the cry of the shepherds,
    and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath
    spoiled their pasture. &l37&rAnd the peaceable habitations are cut down because
    of the fierce anger'
  '14': 'of the Lord. &l38&rHe hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land
    is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce
    anger.'
  '15': 'Chapter 26

    In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came
    this word from the Lord, saying, &l2&rThus saith the Lord; Stand in the court
    of the Lord''s house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship
    in'
  '16': 'the Lord''s house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them;
    diminish not a word: &l3&rIf so be they will hearken, and turn every man from
    his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them
    because of the evil of'
  '17': their doings. &l4&rAnd thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you, &l5&rTo hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and
  '18': sending them, but ye have not hearkened; &l6&rThen will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth. &l7&rSo the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house
  '19': of the Lord. &l8&rNow it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die. &l9&rWhy hast
  '20': thou prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord. &l10&rWhen the princes of Judah heard these
  '21': things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the Lord, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord's house. &l11&rThen spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to
  '22': die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears. &l12&rThen spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have
  '23': 'heard. &l13&rTherefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the
    voice of the Lord your God; and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath
    pronounced against you. &l14&rAs for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me
    as seemeth good and'
  '24': 'meet unto you. &l15&rBut know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death,
    ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and
    upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the Lord hath sent me unto you to
    speak all these words in'
  '25': 'your ears. &l16&rThen said the princes and all the people unto the priests
    and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in
    the name of the Lord our God. &l17&rThen rose up certain of the elders of the
    land, and spake to all'
  '26': the assembly of the people, saying, &l18&rMicah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become
  '27': heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. &l19&rDid Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the Lord, and besought the Lord, and the Lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced
  '28': against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls. &l20&rAnd there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all
  '29': 'the words of Jeremiah. &l21&rAnd when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty
    men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death:
    but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; &l22&rAnd
    Jehoiakim the'
  '30': king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt. &l23&rAnd they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the
  '31': graves of the common people. &l24&rNevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
  '32': 'Chapter 27

    In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came
    this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, &l2&rThus saith the Lord to me;
    Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck, &l3&rAnd send them to the
    king'
  '33': of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah; &l4&rAnd command them to say unto their masters, Thus
  '34': saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; &l5&rI have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.
  '35': '&l6&rAnd now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
    the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him
    also to serve him. &l7&rAnd all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his
    son''s son, until the very'
  '36': 'time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve
    themselves of him. &l8&rAnd it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom
    which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will
    not put their neck under'
  '37': the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the Lord, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. &l9&rTherefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to
  '38': 'your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak
    unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: &l10&rFor they prophesy
    a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you
    out, and ye should'
  '39': perish. &l11&rBut the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the Lord; and they shall till it, and dwell therein. &l12&rI spake also to Zedekiah king of
  '40': Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. &l13&rWhy will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the Lord hath
  '41': 'spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? &l14&rTherefore
    hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall
    not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you. &l15&rFor I have
    not sent'
  '42': them, saith the Lord, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you. &l16&rAlso I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Hearken not
  '43': 'to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the
    vessels of the Lord''s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon:
    for they prophesy a lie unto you. &l17&rHearken not unto them; serve the king
    of Babylon, and live:'
  '44': wherefore should this city be laid waste? &l18&rBut if they be prophets, and if the word of the Lord be with them, let them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king
  '45': of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon. &l19&rFor thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city. &l20&rWhich Nebuchadnezzar
  '46': king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; &l21&rYea, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that
  '47': remain in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem; &l22&rThey shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the Lord; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this

    place, and carried them to Babylon: &l4&rAnd I will bring again to this place'
  '2': 'Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah,
    that went into Babylon, saith the Lord: for I will break the yoke of the king

    presence of the'
  '3': 'priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of
    the Lord, &l6&rEven the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the Lord do so: the Lord
    perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the
    Lord''s house, and all'
  '4': that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place. &l7&rNevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people; &l8&rThe prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against
  '5': many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. &l9&rThe prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him. &l10&rThen
  '6': Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it. &l11&rAnd Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of
  '7': all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. &l12&rThen the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
  '8': '&l13&rGo and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast broken
    the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron. &l14&rFor thus
    saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the
    neck of all these'
  '9': 'nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall
    serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also. &l15&rThen said
    the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The Lord hath
    not sent thee; but'
  '10': 'thou makest this people to trust in a lie. &l16&rTherefore thus saith the
    Lord; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou

    Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem
    unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests,

  '14': Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying, &l4&rThus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be

    your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. &l9&rFor they prophesy falsely unto
    you in my name: I'
  '18': have not sent them, saith the Lord. &l10&rFor thus saith the Lord, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. &l11&rFor I know the thoughts that I think

  '22': in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity; &l17&rThus saith the Lord of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they
  '23': are so evil. &l18&rAnd I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the
  '24': 'nations whither I have driven them: &l19&rBecause they have not hearkened
    to my words, saith the Lord, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets,
    rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the Lord. &l20&rHear
    ye therefore the'

    to Babylon: &l21&rThus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the
    son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto
    you in my name; Behold,'
  '26': I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; &l22&rAnd of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The Lord make thee like Zedekiah and like
  '27': Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; &l23&rBecause they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am
  '28': a witness, saith the Lord. &l24&rThus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, &l25&rThus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to
  '29': Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, &l26&rThe Lord hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the Lord, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a
  '30': 'prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks. &l27&rNow
    therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself
    a prophet to you? &l28&rFor therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This
    captivity is long:'
  '31': build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them. &l29&rAnd Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. &l30&rThen came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, &l31&rSend to all them of the
  '32': 'captivity, saying, Thus saith the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite;
    Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused
    you to trust in a lie: &l32&rTherefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will punish

    them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess
    it. &l4&rAnd these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel and concerning
    Judah. &l5&rFor'

  '37': 'into paleness? &l7&rAlas! for that day is great, so that none is like it:
    it is even the time of Jacob''s trouble, but he shall be saved out of it. &l8&rFor
    it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will break
    his yoke from off thy'

    of him: &l9&rBut they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom
    I will raise up unto them. &l10&rTherefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob,
    saith the Lord;'
  '39': 'neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy
    seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in
    rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid. &l11&rFor I am with thee,
    saith the Lord, to save'
  '40': 'thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee,
    yet I will not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and
    will not leave thee altogether unpunished. &l12&rFor thus saith the Lord, Thy
    bruise is incurable,'
  '41': 'and thy wound is grievous. &l13&rThere is none to plead thy cause, that thou
    mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. &l14&rAll thy lovers have
    forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of
    an enemy, with the'

    thy sins were increased. &l15&rWhy criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow
    is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased,
    I have done these'

  '44': will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after. &l18&rThus saith the Lord; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents,
  '45': 'and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon
    her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof. &l19&rAnd

  '8': 'together to the goodness of the Lord, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil,
    and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered
    garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all. &l13&rThen shall the virgin
    rejoice in the'

    joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. &l14&rAnd
    I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied
    with my'
  '10': goodness, saith the Lord. &l15&rThus saith the Lord; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. &l16&rThus saith the Lord; Refrain thy voice
  '11': 'from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded,
    saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. &l17&rAnd

    to their own border.'
  '12': '&l18&rI have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised
    me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me,

    was turned, I'

    my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly
    remember'
  '14': 'him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy
    upon him, saith the Lord. &l21&rSet thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set
    thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O
    virgin of Israel,'
  '15': turn again to these thy cities. &l22&rHow long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man. &l23&rThus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use

  '19': and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the Lord. &l29&rIn those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge. &l30&rBut every one shall die for his own
  '20': 'iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on
    edge. &l31&rBehold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant
    with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: &l32&rNot according to
    the covenant that I'
  '21': 'made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring
    them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an
    husband unto them, saith the Lord: &l33&rBut this shall be the covenant that I
    will make with the house'
  '22': of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. &l34&rAnd they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother,
  '23': 'saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them
    unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity,
    and I will remember their sin no more. &l35&rThus saith the Lord, which giveth
    the sun for a light by'
  '24': 'day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,
    which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of hosts is his name:
    &l36&rIf those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed
    of Israel also'
  '25': shall cease from being a nation before me for ever. &l37&rThus saith the Lord; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the Lord.
  '26': '&l38&rBehold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the city shall be built
    to the Lord from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner. &l39&rAnd
    the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and
    shall compass about to'
  '27': Goath. &l40&rAnd the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the Lord; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for
  '28': ever.
  '29': 'Chapter 32

    The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king
    of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. &l2&rFor then the king
    of Babylon''s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in
    the'
  '30': court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house. &l3&rFor Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he
  '31': shall take it; &l4&rAnd Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; &l5&rAnd he
  '32': 'shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him,
    saith the Lord: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper. &l6&rAnd
    Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, &l7&rBehold, Hanameel
    the son of Shallum'
  '33': 'thine uncle shall come unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth:
    for the right of redemption is thine to buy it. &l8&rSo Hanameel mine uncle''s
    son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord, and
    said unto me, Buy'
  '34': 'my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin:
    for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for
    thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord. &l9&rAnd I bought the
    field of Hanameel'
  '35': my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. &l10&rAnd I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. &l11&rSo I took the evidence of the
  '36': 'purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and
    that which was open: &l12&rAnd I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch
    the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle''s
    son, and in the presence'
  '37': of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison. &l13&rAnd I charged Baruch before them, saying, &l14&rThus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence
  '38': of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days. &l15&rFor thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again
  '39': in this land. &l16&rNow when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the Lord, saying, &l17&rAh Lord God! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there
  '40': 'is nothing too hard for thee: &l18&rThou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands,
    and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children
    after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the Lord of hosts, is his name, &l19&rGreat
    in counsel, and'
  '41': 'mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of
    men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his
    doings: &l20&rWhich hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto
    this day, and in Israel,'
  '42': and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day; &l21&rAnd hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror; &l22&rAnd
  '43': hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; &l23&rAnd they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou
  '44': 'commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come
    upon them: &l24&rBehold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and
    the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because
    of the sword, and of'
  '45': 'the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass;
    and, behold, thou seest it. &l25&rAnd thou hast said unto me, O Lord God, Buy
    thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand
    of the Chaldeans.'
  '46': '&l26&rThen came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, &l27&rBehold,
    I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me? &l28&rTherefore
    thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans,
    and into'
  '47': 'the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it: &l29&rAnd
    the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city,
    and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal,
    and poured out'
  '48': 'drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger. &l30&rFor the children
    of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth:
    for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their
    hands,'
  '49': saith the Lord. &l31&rFor this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face, &l32&rBecause of all the evil of the children of Israel and
  '50': of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

    them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive
    instruction. &l34&rBut they set their abominations in the house, which is called'
  '2': by my name, to defile it. &l35&rAnd they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind,
  '3': that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. &l36&rAnd now therefore thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine,

  '7': '&l42&rFor thus saith the Lord; Like as I have brought all this great evil

    Moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was
    yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying, &l2&rThus saith the Lord the maker
    thereof, the Lord that formed it, to establish it; the Lord is his name; &l3&rCall'
  '11': unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. &l4&rFor thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by
  '12': the mounts, and by the sword; &l5&rThey come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city. &l6&rBehold, I
  '13': will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. &l7&rAnd I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. &l8&rAnd I will
  '14': cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. &l9&rAnd it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour
  '15': 'before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I
    do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all
    the prosperity that I procure unto it. &l10&rThus saith the Lord; Again there
    shall be heard in this'
  '16': place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast, &l11&rThe voice of joy, and the voice of gladness,

    that shall say, Praise the Lord of hosts: for the Lord is good; for his mercy
    endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the
    house of the Lord. For'
  '18': I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the Lord. &l12&rThus saith the Lord of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds
  '19': causing their flocks to lie down. &l13&rIn the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under

  '21': 'cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute
    judgment and righteousness in the land. &l16&rIn those days shall Judah be saved,
    and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be
    called, The Lord'
  '22': our righteousness. &l17&rFor thus saith the Lord; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel; &l18&rNeither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do
  '23': sacrifice continually. &l19&rAnd the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, saying, &l20&rThus saith the Lord; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season; &l21&rThen may
  '24': 'also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have
    a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
    &l22&rAs the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured:
    so will I'
  '25': multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me. &l23&rMoreover the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, &l24&rConsiderest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the Lord hath chosen, he
  '26': hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them. &l25&rThus saith the Lord; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; &l26&rThen
  '27': 'will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that I will not
    take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob:

    The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
    and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the
    people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,'
  '29': '&l2&rThus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king

    the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire: &l3&rAnd thou
    shalt not escape out'

  '31': 'of Judah; Thus saith the Lord of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword: &l5&rBut
    thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings
    which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament
    thee, saying,'
  '32': Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the Lord. &l6&rThen Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, &l7&rWhen the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that
  '33': 'were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities
    remained of the cities of Judah. &l8&rThis is the word that came unto Jeremiah
    from the Lord, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people
    which were at'
  '34': Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; &l9&rThat every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother. &l10&rNow when all the
  '35': princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go. &l11&rBut
  '36': afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. &l12&rTherefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, &l13&rThus
  '37': saith the Lord, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying, &l14&rAt the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath
  '38': 'been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let
    him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined
    their ear. &l15&rAnd ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming
    liberty'
  '39': 'every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house
    which is called by my name: &l16&rBut ye turned and polluted my name, and caused
    every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty
    at their pleasure,'
  '40': 'to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants
    and for handmaids. &l17&rTherefore thus saith the Lord; Ye have not hearkened
    unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his
    neighbour: behold, I'
  '41': proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. &l18&rAnd I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed
  '42': the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof, &l19&rThe princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which
  '43': 'passed between the parts of the calf; &l20&rI will even give them into the

  '44': '&l21&rAnd Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand

    Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his
    precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you: &l19&rTherefore
    thus saith the Lord'
  '10': of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.
  '11': 'Chapter 36

    And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
    Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, &l2&rTake thee
    a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee
    against'
  '12': Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day. &l3&rIt may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every
  '13': 'man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. &l4&rThen
    Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah
    all the words of the Lord, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.
    &l5&rAnd'
  '14': 'Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house
    of the Lord: &l6&rTherefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written
    from my mouth, the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in the Lord''s
    house upon the'
  '15': 'fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that
    come out of their cities. &l7&rIt may be they will present their supplication
    before the Lord, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the
    anger and the fury that'
  '16': the Lord hath pronounced against this people. &l8&rAnd Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord's house. &l9&rAnd it came to pass in the fifth year of
  '17': Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem. &l10&rThen read Baruch in the book the words
  '18': of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the Lord's house, in the ears of all the people. &l11&rWhen Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of
  '19': 'Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord, &l12&rThen
    he went down into the king''s house, into the scribe''s chamber: and, lo, all
    the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah,
    and Elnathan the son of'
  '20': Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. &l13&rThen Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. &l14&rTherefore all the princes
  '21': sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto
  '22': them. &l15&rAnd they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears. &l16&rNow it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the
  '23': king of all these words. &l17&rAnd they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth? &l18&rThen Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
  '24': '&l19&rThen said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah;
    and let no man know where ye be. &l20&rAnd they went in to the king into the court,
    but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all
    the words in the'
  '25': 'ears of the king. &l21&rSo the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he
    took it out of Elishama the scribe''s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears
    of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king. &l22&rNow
    the king sat in'
  '26': 'the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning
    before him. &l23&rAnd it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four
    leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the
    hearth, until all'
  '27': the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth. &l24&rYet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. &l25&rNevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
  '28': 'intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not
    hear them. &l26&rBut the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah
    the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe
    and Jeremiah the'
  '29': 'prophet: but the Lord hid them. &l27&rThen the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah,
    after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the
    mouth of Jeremiah, saying, &l28&rTake thee again another roll, and write in it
    all the former'
  '30': words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. &l29&rAnd thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall
  '31': 'certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence
    man and beast? &l30&rTherefore thus saith the Lord of Jehoiakim king of Judah;
    He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be
    cast out in the day to'
  '32': the heat, and in the night to the frost. &l31&rAnd I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against
  '33': 'them; but they hearkened not. &l32&rThen took Jeremiah another roll, and
    gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth
    of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned
    in the fire: and there'
  '34': were added besides unto them many like words.
  '35': 'Chapter 37

    And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim,
    whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. &l2&rBut neither
    he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words'
  '36': of the Lord, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah. &l3&rAnd Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the Lord our God for us. &l4&rNow Jeremiah came in
  '37': 'and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison. &l5&rThen
    Pharaoh''s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged
    Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem. &l6&rThen came
    the word of the'
  '38': Lord unto the prophet Jeremiah saying, &l7&rThus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their
  '39': 'own land. &l8&rAnd the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this
    city, and take it, and burn it with fire. &l9&rThus saith the Lord; Deceive not
    yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall
    not depart. &l10&rFor'
  '40': though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire. &l11&rAnd it came to pass, that when the army of the
  '41': Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army, &l12&rThen Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people. &l13&rAnd when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a
  '42': captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans. &l14&rThen said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he
  '43': 'hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
    &l15&rWherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him
    in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.
    &l16&rWhen'
  '44': 'Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah
    had remained there many days; &l17&rThen Zedekiah the king sent, and took him
    out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word
    from the Lord? And'
  '45': 'Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand
    of the king of Babylon. &l18&rMoreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What
    have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people,
    that ye have put me in'
  '46': 'prison? &l19&rWhere are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying,
    The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land? &l20&rTherefore
    hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be
    accepted'
  '47': before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there. &l21&rThen Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread
  '48': out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
  '49': 'Chapter 38

    Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the
    son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah
    had spoken unto all the people, saying, &l2&rThus saith the Lord, He that remaineth'
  '50': 'in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:
    but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life

    unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth'
  '2': 'the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all
    the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare

  '20': 'Chapter 39

    In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar
    king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it. &l2&rAnd
    in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the'

  '22': '&l4&rAnd it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them,
    and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night,
    by the way of the king''s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went
    out the way of the'

    in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to
    Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave
    judgment upon him.'
  '24': '&l6&rThen the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before
    his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. &l7&rMoreover
    he put out Zedekiah''s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.
    &l8&rAnd the Chaldeans'
  '25': burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem. &l9&rThen Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that
  '26': fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained. &l10&rBut Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time. &l11&rNow
  '27': Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying, &l12&rTake him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee. &l13&rSo Nebuzaradan the captain of
  '28': the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes; &l14&rEven they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that
  '29': 'he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people. &l15&rNow the word
    of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison,
    saying, &l16&rGo and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the
    Lord of hosts, the'

    not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee. &l17&rBut
    I will deliver thee in that day, saith the Lord: and thou shalt not be given into
    the hand of the men'
  '31': 'of whom thou art afraid. &l18&rFor I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt
    not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou

  '32': 'Chapter 40

    The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, after that Nebuzaradan the captain
    of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains
    among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were'
  '33': 'carried away captive unto Babylon. &l2&rAnd the captain of the guard took
    Jeremiah, and said unto him, The Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this
    place. &l3&rNow the Lord hath brought it, and done according as he hath said:
    because ye have sinned'
  '34': against the Lord, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you. &l4&rAnd now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look
  '35': 'well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon,
    forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient
    for thee to go, thither go. &l5&rNow while he was not yet gone back, he said,

    go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard
    gave him victuals'
  '37': and a reward, and let him go. &l6&rThen went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land. &l7&rNow when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men,
  '38': heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon; &l8&rThen they came to
  '39': Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. &l9&rAnd Gedaliah the
  '40': 'son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying,
    Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon,
    and it shall be well with you. &l10&rAs for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah,
    to serve the'
  '41': 'Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits,

    &l11&rLikewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and
    in Edom, and'
  '42': that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; &l12&rEven all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came
  '43': to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much. &l13&rMoreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, &l14&rAnd said unto him, Dost
  '44': thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. &l15&rThen Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying, Let me go, I
  '45': 'pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall
    know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto
    thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish? &l16&rBut Gedaliah

  '46': 'unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest
    falsely of Ishmael.'

    Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the

  '9': with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought
  '10': 'again from Gibeon: &l17&rAnd they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of
    Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt, &l18&rBecause of the
    Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
    had slain Gedaliah the'
  '11': son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.
  '12': 'Chapter 42

    Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah
    the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest,
    came near, &l2&rAnd said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our'
  '13': supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the Lord thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:) &l3&rThat the Lord thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that
  '14': we may do. &l4&rThen Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the Lord your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the Lord shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will
  '15': keep nothing back from you. &l5&rThen they said to Jeremiah, The Lord be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us. &l6&rWhether it be good, or whether it be evil,
  '16': we will obey the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the Lord our God. &l7&rAnd it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah. &l8&rThen called he Johanan
  '17': the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, &l9&rAnd said unto them, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before
  '18': 'him; &l10&rIf ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and
    not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me
    of the evil that I have done unto you. &l11&rBe not afraid of the king of Babylon,
    of whom ye are'
  '19': 'afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the Lord: for I am with you to save you,
    and to deliver you from his hand. &l12&rAnd I will shew mercies unto you, that
    he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land. &l13&rBut
    if ye say, We will'
  '20': 'not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the Lord your God, &l14&rSaying,
    No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear
    the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell: &l15&rAnd
    now'
  '21': therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; &l16&rThen it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall
  '22': overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. &l17&rSo shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall
  '23': 'die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them
    shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them. &l18&rFor thus
    saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been
    poured forth upon the'
  '24': 'inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when
    ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment,
    and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more. &l19&rThe Lord
    hath said concerning'
  '25': 'you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have
    admonished you this day. &l20&rFor ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent
    me unto the Lord your God, saying, Pray for us unto the Lord our God; and according
    unto all that the'

  '27': that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.
  '28': 'Chapter 43

    And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the
    people all the words of the Lord their God, for which the Lord their God had sent
    him to them, even all these words, &l2&rThen spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah,'
  '29': 'and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah,
    Thou speakest falsely: the Lord our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into
    Egypt to sojourn there: &l3&rBut Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against
    us, for to deliver'
  '30': us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon. &l4&rSo Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the Lord, to dwell in the land
  '31': of Judah. &l5&rBut Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah; &l6&rEven men, and women, and children, and
  '32': 'the king''s daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the
    guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah
    the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. &l7&rSo they came into the land of
    Egypt: for they obeyed'
  '33': 'not the voice of the Lord: thus came they even to Tahpanhes. &l8&rThen came
    the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, &l9&rTake great stones
    in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry
    of Pharaoh''s house'
  '34': in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; &l10&rAnd say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have
  '35': hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them. &l11&rAnd when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword. &l12&rAnd
  '36': 'I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn
    them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of
    Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence
    in peace. &l13&rHe'
  '37': shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.

    The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land
    of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country
    of Pathros, saying, &l2&rThus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have'

  '40': they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers. &l4&rHowbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
  '41': '&l5&rBut they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness,
    to burn no incense unto other gods. &l6&rWherefore my fury and mine anger was
    poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem;
    and they'
  '42': are wasted and desolate, as at this day. &l7&rTherefore now thus saith the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you
  '43': none to remain; &l8&rIn that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all
  '44': the nations of the earth? &l9&rHave ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land
  '45': of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? &l10&rThey are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers. &l11&rTherefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the
  '46': God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah. &l12&rAnd I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the
  '47': 'land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine:
    they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the
    famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and
    a reproach. &l13&rFor I'
  '48': 'will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem,
    by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: &l14&rSo that none of the

  '49': 'that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a

    &l15&rThen all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other
    gods, and all the'
  '50': women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, &l16&rAs for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.

    Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall
    no man abide'

    and through all her land the wounded shall groan. &l53&rThough Babylon should
    mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength,
    yet from me shall'
  '9': 'spoilers come unto her, saith the Lord. &l54&rA sound of a cry cometh from
    Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans: &l55&rBecause the
    Lord hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her
    waves do roar like'
  '10': 'great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered: &l56&rBecause the spoiler
    is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of
    their bows is broken: for the Lord God of recompences shall surely requite. &l57&rAnd
    I will make'
  '11': 'drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her
    mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King,
    whose name is the Lord of hosts. &l58&rThus saith the Lord of hosts; The broad
    walls of Babylon'
  '12': shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary. &l59&rThe word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of
  '13': Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince. &l60&rSo Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written
  '14': against Babylon. &l61&rAnd Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words; &l62&rThen shalt thou say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither
  '15': 'man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever. &l63&rAnd it shall
    be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone
    to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates: &l64&rAnd thou shalt say, Thus
    shall Babylon sink,'
  '16': 'and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall
    be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.'
  '17': 'Chapter 52

    Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven
    years in Jerusalem. And his mother''s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah
    of Libnah. &l2&rAnd he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according'
  '18': to all that Jehoiakim had done. &l3&rFor through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. &l4&rAnd it came to pass in the ninth year of
  '19': his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about. &l5&rSo the city was besieged unto the eleventh
  '20': year of king Zedekiah. &l6&rAnd in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. &l7&rThen the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of
  '21': the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain. &l8&rBut the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook
  '22': Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. &l9&rThen they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him. &l10&rAnd the king of Babylon slew the
  '23': 'sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in
    Riblah. &l11&rThen he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound
    him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day
    of his death.'
  '24': '&l12&rNow in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the
    nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of
    the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem, &l13&rAnd burned
    the house of the Lord,'
  '25': 'and the king''s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses
    of the great men, burned he with fire: &l14&rAnd all the army of the Chaldeans,
    that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem
    round about. &l15&rThen'
  '26': Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. &l16&rBut
  '27': Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen. &l17&rAlso the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the Lord, the
  '28': Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. &l18&rThe caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. &l19&rAnd the basons, and the
  '29': firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away. &l20&rThe two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen
  '30': 'bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house
    of the Lord: the brass of all these vessels was without weight. &l21&rAnd concerning
    the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve
    cubits did'
  '31': 'compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow. &l22&rAnd
    a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits,
    with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The
    second pillar'
  '32': also and the pomegranates were like unto these. &l23&rAnd there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about. &l24&rAnd the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
  '33': 'Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: &l25&rHe
    took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and
    seven men of them that were near the king''s person, which were found in the city;
    and the principal'
  '34': scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city. &l26&rSo Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
  '35': '&l27&rAnd the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah
    in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
    &l28&rThis is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh
    year three thousand'
  '36': 'Jews and three and twenty: &l29&rIn the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar
    he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: &l30&rIn
    the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the
    guard carried away'
  '37': 'captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons
    were four thousand and six hundred. &l31&rAnd it came to pass in the seven and
    thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,
    in the five and'
  '38': twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison. &l32&rAnd spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the
  '39': 'kings that were with him in Babylon, &l33&rAnd changed his prison garments:
    and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life. &l34&rAnd
    for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every
    day a portion until'
  '40': the day of his death, all the days of his life.
