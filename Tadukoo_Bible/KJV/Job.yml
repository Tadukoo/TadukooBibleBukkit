ch1v1: There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
ch1v2: And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
ch1v3: His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
ch1v4: And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
ch1v5: 'And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.'
ch1v6: Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.
ch1v7: And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
ch1v8: And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
ch1v9: Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
ch1v10: Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
ch1v11: But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
ch1v12: And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.
ch1v13: 'And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother''s house:'
ch1v14: 'And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:'
ch1v15: And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
ch1v16: While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
ch1v17: While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
ch1v18: 'While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother''s house:'
ch1v19: And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
ch1v20: Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
ch1v21: 'And said, Naked came I out of my mother''s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.'
ch1v22: In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

ch2v1: Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord.
ch2v2: And the Lord said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
ch2v3: And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
ch2v4: And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
ch2v5: But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
ch2v6: And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.
ch2v7: So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
ch2v8: And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.
ch2v9: Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.
ch2v10: But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
ch2v11: 'Now when Job''s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.'
ch2v12: And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
ch2v13: 'So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.'

ch3v1: After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
ch3v2: And Job spake, and said,
ch3v3: Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.
ch3v4: Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
ch3v5: Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
ch3v6: As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
ch3v7: Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
ch3v8: Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
ch3v9: 'Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:'
ch3v10: Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
ch3v11: Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
ch3v12: Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
ch3v13: 'For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,'
ch3v14: With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;
ch3v15: 'Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:'
ch3v16: Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
ch3v17: There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
ch3v18: There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
ch3v19: The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
ch3v20: Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;
ch3v21: Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
ch3v22: Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?
ch3v23: Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
ch3v24: For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
ch3v25: For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
ch3v26: I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.

ch4v1: Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
ch4v2: If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
ch4v3: Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
ch4v4: Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
ch4v5: But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
ch4v6: Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
ch4v7: Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
ch4v8: Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
ch4v9: By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
ch4v10: The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
ch4v11: The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
ch4v12: Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
ch4v13: In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
ch4v14: Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
ch4v15: 'Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:'
ch4v16: 'It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,'
ch4v17: Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
ch4v18: 'Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:'
ch4v19: How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?
ch4v20: 'They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.'
ch4v21: Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.

ch5v1: Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
ch5v2: For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
ch5v3: 'I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.'
ch5v4: His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
ch5v5: Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
ch5v6: Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
ch5v7: Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
ch5v8: 'I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:'
ch5v9: 'Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:'
ch5v10: 'Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:'
ch5v11: To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
ch5v12: He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
ch5v13: 'He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.'
ch5v14: They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
ch5v15: But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
ch5v16: So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
ch5v17: 'Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:'
ch5v18: 'For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.'
ch5v19: 'He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.'
ch5v20: 'In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.'
ch5v21: 'Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.'
ch5v22: 'At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.'
ch5v23: 'For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.'
ch5v24: And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
ch5v25: Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
ch5v26: Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
ch5v27: Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.

ch6v1: But Job answered and said,
ch6v2: Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
ch6v3: 'For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.'
ch6v4: 'For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.'
ch6v5: Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
ch6v6: Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
ch6v7: The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.
ch6v8: Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
ch6v9: Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
ch6v10: 'Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.'
ch6v11: What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?
ch6v12: Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
ch6v13: Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
ch6v14: To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
ch6v15: My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
ch6v16: 'Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:'
ch6v17: 'What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.'
ch6v18: The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
ch6v19: The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
ch6v20: They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
ch6v21: For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
ch6v22: Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
ch6v23: Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
ch6v24: 'Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.'
ch6v25: How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
ch6v26: Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?
ch6v27: Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.
ch6v28: Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.
ch6v29: Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.
ch6v30: Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?

ch7v1: Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?
ch7v2: 'As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:'
ch7v3: So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
ch7v4: When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
ch7v5: My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
ch7v6: My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.
ch7v7: 'O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.'
ch7v8: 'The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.'
ch7v9: 'As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.'
ch7v10: He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
ch7v11: Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
ch7v12: Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
ch7v13: When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;
ch7v14: 'Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:'
ch7v15: So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.
ch7v16: 'I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.'
ch7v17: What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
ch7v18: And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?
ch7v19: How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
ch7v20: I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
ch7v21: And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.

ch8v1: Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
ch8v2: How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
ch8v3: Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
ch8v4: If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;
ch8v5: If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
ch8v6: If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
ch8v7: Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.

ch8v14: Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.
ch8v15: 'He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.'
ch8v16: He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
ch8v17: His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.
ch8v18: If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
ch8v19: Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
ch8v20: 'Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:'
ch8v21: Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
ch8v22: They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.

ch10v1: My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
ch10v2: I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.
ch10v3: Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
ch10v4: Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?

ch10v6: That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?
ch10v7: Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.

ch10v16: 'For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.'
ch10v17: Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.
ch10v18: Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!
ch10v19: I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.

ch31v23: For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
ch31v24: If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
ch31v25: If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;

ch31v34: Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
ch31v35: Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
ch31v36: Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.

ch32v1: So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
ch32v2: 'Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.'
ch32v3: Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
ch32v4: Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
ch32v5: When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
ch32v6: And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
ch32v7: I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
ch32v8: 'But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.'
ch32v9: 'Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.'
ch32v10: Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
ch32v11: Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
ch32v12: 'Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:'
ch32v13: 'Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.'
ch32v14: 'Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.'
ch32v15: 'They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.'
ch32v16: When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)
ch32v17: I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
ch32v18: For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
ch32v19: Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
ch32v20: 'I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.'
ch32v21: Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
ch32v22: For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.

ch33v3: 'My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.'

ch33v11: He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
ch33v12: 'Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.'
ch33v13: Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
ch33v14: For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
ch33v15: In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
ch33v16: Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
ch33v17: That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
ch33v18: He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
ch33v19: 'He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:'

ch33v29: Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
ch33v30: To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.

ch34v1: Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
ch34v2: Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
ch34v3: For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
ch34v4: 'Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.'
ch34v5: 'For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.'
ch34v6: Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
ch34v7: What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
ch34v8: Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
ch34v9: For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
ch34v10: 'Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.'
ch34v11: For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
ch34v12: Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
ch34v13: Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
ch34v14: If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
ch34v15: All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
ch34v16: 'If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.'
ch34v17: Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
ch34v18: Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?
ch34v19: How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
ch34v20: 'In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.'
ch34v21: For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
ch34v22: There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
ch34v23: For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
ch34v24: He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
ch34v25: Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
ch34v26: He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
ch34v27: 'Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:'
ch34v28: So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
ch34v29: 'When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:'
ch34v30: That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
ch34v31: 'Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:'
ch34v32: 'That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.'
ch34v33: 'Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.'
ch34v34: Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
ch34v35: Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
ch34v36: My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.
ch34v37: For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.

ch35v1: Elihu spake moreover, and said,
ch35v2: Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?
ch35v3: For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
ch35v4: I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
ch35v5: Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.
ch35v6: If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
ch35v7: If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?
ch35v8: Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
ch35v9: 'By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.'

ch35v11: Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
ch35v12: There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
ch35v13: Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
ch35v14: Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
ch35v15: 'But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:'
ch35v16: Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.

ch36v1: Elihu also proceeded, and said,
ch36v2: Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.

ch36v8: And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
ch36v9: Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
ch36v10: He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
ch36v11: If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
ch36v12: But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
ch36v13: 'But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.'
ch36v14: They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
ch36v15: He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
ch36v16: Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
ch36v17: 'But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.'
ch36v18: 'Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.'

ch36v26: Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
ch36v27: 'For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:'

ch42v2: I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.

ch42v8: 'Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.'
