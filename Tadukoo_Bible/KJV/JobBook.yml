  '1': 'Chapter 1

    There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect
    and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. &l2&rAnd there were born
    unto him seven sons and three daughters. &l3&rHis substance also was seven thousand'
  '2': sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. &l4&rAnd his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day;
  '3': and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. &l5&rAnd it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to
  '4': 'the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned,
    and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. &l6&rNow there was a
    day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan
    came also among them.'
  '5': '&l7&rAnd the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered
    the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and
    down in it. &l8&rAnd the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
    Job, that there is'
  '6': none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? &l9&rThen Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? &l10&rHast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all
  '7': that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. &l11&rBut put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. &l12&rAnd the Lord said unto Satan, Behold,
  '8': 'all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.
    So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. &l13&rAnd there was a day when
    his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother''s
    house:'
  '9': '&l14&rAnd there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing,
    and the asses feeding beside them: &l15&rAnd the Sabeans fell upon them, and took
    them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I
    only am escaped'
  '10': alone to tell thee. &l16&rWhile he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. &l17&rWhile he was
  '11': yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. &l18&rWhile he was
  '12': 'yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters
    were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother''s house: &l19&rAnd, behold,
    there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the
    house, and it fell'
  '13': upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. &l20&rThen Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, &l21&rAnd said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
  '14': 'shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed
    be the name of the Lord. &l22&rIn all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.'
  '15': 'Chapter 2

    Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the
    Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord. &l2&rAnd
    the Lord said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Lord,
    and'
  '16': said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. &l3&rAnd the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and
  '17': escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. &l4&rAnd Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. &l5&rBut put forth
  '18': thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. &l6&rAnd the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life. &l7&rSo went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils
  '19': from the sole of his foot unto his crown. &l8&rAnd he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. &l9&rThen said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. &l10&rBut he said unto her,
  '20': Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. &l11&rNow when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him,
  '21': 'they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad
    the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together
    to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. &l12&rAnd when they lifted up their
    eyes afar off, and'
  '22': 'knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one
    his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. &l13&rSo they sat
    down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word
    unto him: for they'
  '23': saw that his grief was very great.
  '24': 'Chapter 3

    After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. &l2&rAnd Job spake, and said,
    &l3&rLet the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said,
    There is a man child conceived. &l4&rLet that day be darkness; let not God regard'
  '25': it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. &l5&rLet darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. &l6&rAs for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the
  '26': days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. &l7&rLo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. &l8&rLet them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. &l9&rLet the stars of the twilight
  '27': 'thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see
    the dawning of the day: &l10&rBecause it shut not up the doors of my mother''s
    womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. &l11&rWhy died I not from the womb? why did
    I not give up the ghost'
  '28': 'when I came out of the belly? &l12&rWhy did the knees prevent me? or why
    the breasts that I should suck? &l13&rFor now should I have lain still and been
    quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, &l14&rWith kings and counsellors
    of the earth,'
  '29': 'which build desolate places for themselves; &l15&rOr with princes that had
    gold, who filled their houses with silver: &l16&rOr as an hidden untimely birth
    I had not been; as infants which never saw light. &l17&rThere the wicked cease
    from troubling; and'
  '30': there the weary be at rest. &l18&rThere the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. &l19&rThe small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master. &l20&rWherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life
  '31': unto the bitter in soul; &l21&rWhich long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; &l22&rWhich rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? &l23&rWhy is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom
  '32': God hath hedged in? &l24&rFor my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. &l25&rFor the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. &l26&rI was not in safety, neither had
  '33': I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
  '34': 'Chapter 4

    Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, &l2&rIf we assay to commune with
    thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? &l3&rBehold,
    thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. &l4&rThy'
  '35': words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. &l5&rBut now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. &l6&rIs not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness
  '36': of thy ways? &l7&rRemember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? &l8&rEven as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. &l9&rBy the blast of God they perish, and by the breath
  '37': of his nostrils are they consumed. &l10&rThe roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. &l11&rThe old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad. &l12&rNow a
  '38': thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof. &l13&rIn thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, &l14&rFear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. &l15&rThen a spirit passed
  '39': 'before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: &l16&rIt stood still, but
    I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was
    silence, and I heard a voice, saying, &l17&rShall mortal man be more just than
    God? shall a man be more'
  '40': 'pure than his maker? &l18&rBehold, he put no trust in his servants; and his
    angels he charged with folly: &l19&rHow much less in them that dwell in houses
    of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth? &l20&rThey
    are destroyed'
  '41': 'from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it. &l21&rDoth
    not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.'
  '42': 'Chapter 5

    Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt
    thou turn? &l2&rFor wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly
    one. &l3&rI have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.'
  '43': '&l4&rHis children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate,
    neither is there any to deliver them. &l5&rWhose harvest the hungry eateth up,
    and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
    &l6&rAlthough'
  '44': 'affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out
    of the ground; &l7&rYet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. &l8&rI
    would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: &l9&rWhich doeth great
    things and'
  '45': 'unsearchable; marvellous things without number: &l10&rWho giveth rain upon
    the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: &l11&rTo set up on high those that
    be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety. &l12&rHe disappointeth
    the devices of the'
  '46': 'crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. &l13&rHe taketh
    the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
    &l14&rThey meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in
    the night.'
  '47': '&l15&rBut he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the
    hand of the mighty. &l16&rSo the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
    &l17&rBehold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou
    the chastening of'
  '48': 'the Almighty: &l18&rFor he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and
    his hands make whole. &l19&rHe shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven
    there shall no evil touch thee. &l20&rIn famine he shall redeem thee from death:
    and in war from the'
  '49': 'power of the sword. &l21&rThou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue:
    neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. &l22&rAt destruction
    and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the
    earth. &l23&rFor'
  '50': 'thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the
    field shall be at peace with thee. &l24&rAnd thou shalt know that thy tabernacle
    shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.'

    &l25&rThou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as
    the grass of the earth. &l26&rThou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like
    as a shock of corn cometh in in his season. &l27&rLo this, we have searched it,'
  '2': so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
  '3': 'Chapter 6

    But Job answered and said, &l2&rOh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my
    calamity laid in the balances together! &l3&rFor now it would be heavier than
    the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. &l4&rFor the arrows
    of the'
  '4': 'Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors
    of God do set themselves in array against me. &l5&rDoth the wild ass bray when
    he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? &l6&rCan that which is unsavoury
    be eaten without'
  '5': salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? &l7&rThe things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat. &l8&rOh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! &l9&rEven that it would please God to
  '6': 'destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! &l10&rThen should
    I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for
    I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. &l11&rWhat is my strength, that
    I should hope?'
  '7': and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? &l12&rIs my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? &l13&rIs not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? &l14&rTo him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend;
  '8': 'but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. &l15&rMy brethren have dealt deceitfully
    as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away; &l16&rWhich are blackish
    by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid: &l17&rWhat time they wax warm,
    they'
  '9': 'vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. &l18&rThe paths
    of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. &l19&rThe troops
    of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. &l20&rThey were confounded
    because they'
  '10': had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. &l21&rFor now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid. &l22&rDid I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? &l23&rOr, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from
  '11': 'the hand of the mighty? &l24&rTeach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause
    me to understand wherein I have erred. &l25&rHow forcible are right words! but
    what doth your arguing reprove? &l26&rDo ye imagine to reprove words, and the
    speeches of one that'
  '12': is desperate, which are as wind? &l27&rYea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend. &l28&rNow therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie. &l29&rReturn, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return
  '13': again, my righteousness is in it. &l30&rIs there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
  '14': 'Chapter 7

    Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the
    days of an hireling? &l2&rAs a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an
    hireling looketh for the reward of his work: &l3&rSo am I made to possess months
    of'
  '15': vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me. &l4&rWhen I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. &l5&rMy flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
  '16': 'broken, and become loathsome. &l6&rMy days are swifter than a weaver''s shuttle,
    and are spent without hope. &l7&rO remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall
    no more see good. &l8&rThe eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more:
    thine eyes are'
  '17': 'upon me, and I am not. &l9&rAs the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away:
    so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. &l10&rHe shall return
    no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. &l11&rTherefore
    I will not refrain my'
  '18': mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. &l12&rAm I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? &l13&rWhen I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints; &l14&rThen thou
  '19': 'scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: &l15&rSo that
    my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life. &l16&rI loathe it;
    I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity. &l17&rWhat is man,
    that thou shouldest'
  '20': magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? &l18&rAnd that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment? &l19&rHow long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? &l20&rI have
  '21': sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? &l21&rAnd why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and
  '22': thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
  '23': 'Chapter 8

    Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, &l2&rHow long wilt thou speak these
    things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? &l3&rDoth
    God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? &l4&rIf thy children'
  '24': have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; &l5&rIf thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; &l6&rIf thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the
  '25': 'habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. &l7&rThough thy beginning was
    small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. &l8&rFor enquire, I pray thee,
    of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: &l9&r(For
    we are but of'
  '26': yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) &l10&rShall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? &l11&rCan the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? &l12&rWhilst it is yet in
  '27': 'his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. &l13&rSo
    are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite''s hope shall perish:
    &l14&rWhose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider''s web. &l15&rHe
    shall lean upon'
  '28': 'his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not
    endure. &l16&rHe is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his
    garden. &l17&rHis roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.
    &l18&rIf he destroy'
  '29': 'him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
    &l19&rBehold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
    &l20&rBehold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil
    doers: &l21&rTill'
  '30': he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. &l22&rThey that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
  '31': 'Chapter 9

    Then Job answered and said, &l2&rI know it is so of a truth: but how should man
    be just with God? &l3&rIf he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of
    a thousand. &l4&rHe is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened'
  '32': 'himself against him, and hath prospered? &l5&rWhich removeth the mountains,
    and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. &l6&rWhich shaketh the
    earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. &l7&rWhich commandeth
    the sun, and it riseth'
  '33': not; and sealeth up the stars. &l8&rWhich alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. &l9&rWhich maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. &l10&rWhich doeth great things past finding out; yea, and
  '34': 'wonders without number. &l11&rLo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth
    on also, but I perceive him not. &l12&rBehold, he taketh away, who can hinder
    him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? &l13&rIf God will not withdraw his
    anger, the proud'
  '35': helpers do stoop under him. &l14&rHow much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? &l15&rWhom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. &l16&rIf I had called, and he had
  '36': answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. &l17&rFor he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. &l18&rHe will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. &l19&rIf I speak of
  '37': 'strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to
    plead? &l20&rIf I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I
    am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. &l21&rThough I were perfect, yet
    would I not know my'
  '38': 'soul: I would despise my life. &l22&rThis is one thing, therefore I said
    it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. &l23&rIf the scourge slay suddenly,
    he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. &l24&rThe earth is given into the
    hand of the wicked: he'
  '39': 'covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? &l25&rNow
    my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. &l26&rThey
    are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. &l27&rIf
    I say, I'
  '40': 'will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:
    &l28&rI am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
    &l29&rIf I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? &l30&rIf I wash myself with snow
    water, and make'
  '41': my hands never so clean; &l31&rYet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. &l32&rFor he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. &l33&rNeither is there any daysman betwixt us,
  '42': 'that might lay his hand upon us both. &l34&rLet him take his rod away from
    me, and let not his fear terrify me: &l35&rThen would I speak, and not fear him;
    but it is not so with me.'
  '43': 'Chapter 10

    My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak
    in the bitterness of my soul. &l2&rI will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew
    me wherefore thou contendest with me. &l3&rIs it good unto thee that thou shouldest'
  '44': oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? &l4&rHast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? &l5&rAre thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days, &l6&rThat thou enquirest
  '45': after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? &l7&rThou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. &l8&rThine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. &l9&rRemember, I
  '46': beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? &l10&rHast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? &l11&rThou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
  '47': '&l12&rThou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved
    my spirit. &l13&rAnd these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this
    is with thee. &l14&rIf I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me
    from mine'
  '48': 'iniquity. &l15&rIf I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will
    I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;

  '38': make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? &l16&rIf I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; &l17&rOr have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; &l18&r(For from my
  '39': youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) &l19&rIf I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; &l20&rIf his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the
  '40': 'fleece of my sheep; &l21&rIf I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
    when I saw my help in the gate: &l22&rThen let mine arm fall from my shoulder
    blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. &l23&rFor destruction from God was
    a terror to me, and'
  '41': by reason of his highness I could not endure. &l24&rIf I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; &l25&rIf I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; &l26&rIf I beheld the sun when it
  '42': 'shined, or the moon walking in brightness; &l27&rAnd my heart hath been secretly
    enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: &l28&rThis also were an iniquity to
    be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above. &l29&rIf
    I rejoice at'
  '43': 'the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found
    him: &l30&rNeither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
    &l31&rIf the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot
    be satisfied.'
  '44': '&l32&rThe stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to
    the traveller. &l33&rIf I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity
    in my bosom: &l34&rDid I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families
    terrify me, that'
  '45': I kept silence, and went not out of the door? &l35&rOh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. &l36&rSurely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
  '46': ' &l37&rI would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would
    I go near unto him. &l38&rIf my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise
    thereof complain; &l39&rIf I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have
    caused the owners'

    cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.'

    So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
    &l2&rThen was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the
    kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself'
  '49': rather than God. &l3&rAlso against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. &l4&rNow Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. &l5&rWhen Elihu saw that there was no
  '50': answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled. &l6&rAnd Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.

    Furthermore Elihu answered and said, &l2&rHear my words, O ye wise men; and give

    tasteth meat. &l4&rLet us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what'
  '20': 'is good. &l5&rFor Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away
    my judgment. &l6&rShould I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without
    transgression. &l7&rWhat man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
    &l8&rWhich goeth in'
  '21': 'company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. &l9&rFor
    he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
    &l10&rTherefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that
    he should do'
  '22': wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. &l11&rFor the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. &l12&rYea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert
  '23': judgment. &l13&rWho hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? &l14&rIf he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; &l15&rAll flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto
  '24': 'dust. &l16&rIf now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice
    of my words. &l17&rShall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn
    him that is most just? &l18&rIs it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and
    to princes, Ye are'
  '25': 'ungodly? &l19&rHow much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes,
    nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
    &l20&rIn a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight,
    and pass away:'
  '26': and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. &l21&rFor his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. &l22&rThere is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. &l23&rFor he will not lay upon
  '27': man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God. &l24&rHe shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. &l25&rTherefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are
  '28': 'destroyed. &l26&rHe striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
    &l27&rBecause they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
    &l28&rSo that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth
    the cry of the'
  '29': 'afflicted. &l29&rWhen he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and
    when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a
    nation, or against a man only: &l30&rThat the hypocrite reign not, lest the people
    be ensnared.'
  '30': '&l31&rSurely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I
    will not offend any more: &l32&rThat which I see not teach thou me: if I have
    done iniquity, I will do no more. &l33&rShould it be according to thy mind? he
    will recompense it,'
  '31': 'whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what
    thou knowest. &l34&rLet men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken
    unto me. &l35&rJob hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
    &l36&rMy'
  '32': desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. &l37&rFor he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
  '33': 'Chapter 35

    Elihu spake moreover, and said, &l2&rThinkest thou this to be right, that thou
    saidst, My righteousness is more than God''s? &l3&rFor thou saidst, What advantage
    will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my
    sin?'
  '34': '&l4&rI will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. &l5&rLook unto the
    heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. &l6&rIf thou
    sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied,
    what doest thou unto'
  '35': him? &l7&rIf thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? &l8&rThy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man. &l9&rBy reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the
  '36': 'oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. &l10&rBut
    none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; &l11&rWho teacheth
    us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?'
  '37': '&l12&rThere they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil
    men. &l13&rSurely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
    &l14&rAlthough thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him;
    therefore trust thou'
  '38': 'in him. &l15&rBut now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger;
    yet he knoweth it not in great extremity: &l16&rTherefore doth Job open his mouth
    in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.'
  '39': 'Chapter 36

    Elihu also proceeded, and said, &l2&rSuffer me a little, and I will shew thee
    that I have yet to speak on God''s behalf. &l3&rI will fetch my knowledge from
    afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. &l4&rFor truly my words shall
    not be'
  '40': 'false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. &l5&rBehold, God is
    mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom. &l6&rHe preserveth
    not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. &l7&rHe withdraweth
    not his eyes from'
  '41': 'the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish
    them for ever, and they are exalted. &l8&rAnd if they be bound in fetters, and
    be holden in cords of affliction; &l9&rThen he sheweth them their work, and their
    transgressions'
  '42': that they have exceeded. &l10&rHe openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. &l11&rIf they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. &l12&rBut if they obey not,
  '43': 'they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. &l13&rBut
    the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. &l14&rThey
    die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. &l15&rHe delivereth the poor
    in his'
  '44': affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. &l16&rEven so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. &l17&rBut thou hast
  '45': 'fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
    &l18&rBecause there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then
    a great ransom cannot deliver thee. &l19&rWill he esteem thy riches? no, not gold,
    nor all the'
  '46': 'forces of strength. &l20&rDesire not the night, when people are cut off in
    their place. &l21&rTake heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather
    than affliction. &l22&rBehold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
    &l23&rWho hath'
  '47': enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? &l24&rRemember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. &l25&rEvery man may see it; man may behold it afar off. &l26&rBehold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number
  '48': 'of his years be searched out. &l27&rFor he maketh small the drops of water:
    they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: &l28&rWhich the clouds do
    drop and distil upon man abundantly. &l29&rAlso can any understand the spreadings
    of the clouds, or'
  '49': the noise of his tabernacle? &l30&rBehold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. &l31&rFor by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. &l32&rWith clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by

  '31': deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. &l18&rWhat time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. &l19&rHast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? &l20&rCanst thou
  '32': 'make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
    &l21&rHe paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet
    the armed men. &l22&rHe mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth
    he back from the'
  '33': 'sword. &l23&rThe quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the
    shield. &l24&rHe swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth
    he that it is the sound of the trumpet. &l25&rHe saith among the trumpets, Ha,
    ha; and he smelleth'
  '34': the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. &l26&rDoth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? &l27&rDoth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? &l28&rShe dwelleth and abideth on
  '35': 'the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. &l29&rFrom thence
    she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. &l30&rHer young ones also
    suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.'
  '36': 'Chapter 40

    Moreover the Lord answered Job, and said, &l2&rShall he that contendeth with the
    Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. &l3&rThen Job
    answered the Lord, and said, &l4&rBehold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee?
    I will'
  '37': 'lay mine hand upon my mouth. &l5&rOnce have I spoken; but I will not answer:
    yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. &l6&rThen answered the Lord unto Job
    out of the whirlwind, and said, &l7&rGird up thy loins now like a man: I will
    demand of thee, and'
  '38': declare thou unto me. &l8&rWilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? &l9&rHast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? &l10&rDeck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array
  '39': 'thyself with glory and beauty. &l11&rCast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and
    behold every one that is proud, and abase him. &l12&rLook on every one that is
    proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. &l13&rHide
    them in the dust'
  '40': together; and bind their faces in secret. &l14&rThen will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. &l15&rBehold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. &l16&rLo now, his strength is in his loins, and his
  '41': 'force is in the navel of his belly. &l17&rHe moveth his tail like a cedar:
    the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. &l18&rHis bones are as strong pieces
    of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. &l19&rHe is the chief of the ways of
    God: he that made'
  '42': him can make his sword to approach unto him. &l20&rSurely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. &l21&rHe lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. &l22&rThe shady trees cover him with their
  '43': 'shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. &l23&rBehold, he drinketh
    up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
    &l24&rHe taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.'
  '44': 'Chapter 41

    Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou
    lettest down? &l2&rCanst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through
    with a thorn? &l3&rWill he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft'
  '45': words unto thee? &l4&rWill he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? &l5&rWilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? &l6&rShall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him
  '46': 'among the merchants? &l7&rCanst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or
    his head with fish spears? &l8&rLay thine hand upon him, remember the battle,
    do no more. &l9&rBehold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down
    even at the sight of him?'
  '47': ' &l10&rNone is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand
    before me? &l11&rWho hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is
    under the whole heaven is mine. &l12&rI will not conceal his parts, nor his power,
    nor his comely'
  '48': proportion. &l13&rWho can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? &l14&rWho can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. &l15&rHis scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
  '49': '&l16&rOne is so near to another, that no air can come between them. &l17&rThey
    are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
    &l18&rBy his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of
    the morning.'
  '50': '&l19&rOut of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. &l20&rOut
    of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. &l21&rHis breath
    kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.'

  '1': 'Chapter 41 Cont.

    &l22&rIn his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
    &l23&rThe flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves;
    they cannot be moved. &l24&rHis heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a'
  '2': 'piece of the nether millstone. &l25&rWhen he raiseth up himself, the mighty
    are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. &l26&rThe sword of
    him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. &l27&rHe
    esteemeth iron as'
  '3': 'straw, and brass as rotten wood. &l28&rThe arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones
    are turned with him into stubble. &l29&rDarts are counted as stubble: he laugheth
    at the shaking of a spear. &l30&rSharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp
    pointed'
  '4': 'things upon the mire. &l31&rHe maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh
    the sea like a pot of ointment. &l32&rHe maketh a path to shine after him; one
    would think the deep to be hoary. &l33&rUpon earth there is not his like, who
    is made without fear.'

    pride.'

    Then Job answered the Lord, and said, &l2&rI know that thou canst do every thing,
    and that no thought can be withholden from thee. &l3&rWho is he that hideth counsel
    without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too'
  '7': 'wonderful for me, which I knew not. &l4&rHear, I beseech thee, and I will
    speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. &l5&rI have heard of thee
    by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. &l6&rWherefore I abhor
    myself, and repent in'
  '8': 'dust and ashes. &l7&rAnd it was so, that after the Lord had spoken these words
    unto Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee,
    and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right,
    as my'
  '9': 'servant Job hath. &l8&rTherefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven
    rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering;
    and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with
    you after your folly,'
  '10': 'in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant
    Job. &l9&rSo Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite
    went, and did according as the Lord commanded them: the Lord also accepted Job.
    &l10&rAnd the Lord'
  '11': 'turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord
    gave Job twice as much as he had before. &l11&rThen came there unto him all his
    brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance
    before, and did eat'
  '12': 'bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over
    all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece
    of money, and every one an earring of gold. &l12&rSo the Lord blessed the latter
    end of Job more'
  '13': 'than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand
    camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. &l13&rHe had also
    seven sons and three daughters. &l14&rAnd he called the name of the first, Jemima;
    and the name of the'
  '14': 'second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch. &l15&rAnd in all
    the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father
    gave them inheritance among their brethren. &l16&rAfter this lived Job an hundred
    and forty years, and'
  '15': saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations. &l17&rSo Job died, being old and full of days.
