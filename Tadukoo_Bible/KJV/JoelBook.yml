  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. &l2&rHear this, ye
    old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your
    days, or even in the days of your fathers? &l3&rTell ye your children of it, and
    let your'
  '2': children tell their children, and their children another generation. &l4&rThat which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller
  '3': eaten. &l5&rAwake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. &l6&rFor a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he
  '4': 'hath the cheek teeth of a great lion. &l7&rHe hath laid my vine waste, and
    barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches
    thereof are made white. &l8&rLament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the
    husband of her youth.'
  '5': '&l9&rThe meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of
    the Lord; the priests, the Lord''s ministers, mourn. &l10&rThe field is wasted,
    the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
    &l11&rBe ye'
  '6': ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished. &l12&rThe vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even
  '7': 'all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from
    the sons of men. &l13&rGird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers
    of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the
    meat offering and'
  '8': the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. &l14&rSanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God, and cry unto the Lord, &l15&rAlas for the day! for the
  '9': day of the Lord is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come. &l16&rIs not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God? &l17&rThe seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the
  '10': 'barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. &l18&rHow do the beasts
    groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the
    flocks of sheep are made desolate. &l19&rO Lord, to thee will I cry: for the fire
    hath devoured the'
  '11': 'pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the
    field. &l20&rThe beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters
    are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.'
  '12': 'Chapter 2

    Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the
    inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh
    at hand; &l2&rA day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick'
  '13': 'darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a
    strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it,
    even to the years of many generations. &l3&rA fire devoureth before them; and
    behind them a flame'
  '14': 'burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a
    desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them. &l4&rThe appearance of
    them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run. &l5&rLike
    the noise of'
  '15': 'chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame
    of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array. &l6&rBefore
    their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.
    &l7&rThey'
  '16': 'shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and
    they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:
    &l8&rNeither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path:
    and when they fall upon'
  '17': the sword, they shall not be wounded. &l9&rThey shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief. &l10&rThe earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall
  '18': 'tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw
    their shining: &l11&rAnd the Lord shall utter his voice before his army: for his
    camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the
    Lord is great and'
  '19': 'very terrible; and who can abide it? &l12&rTherefore also now, saith the
    Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping,
    and with mourning: &l13&rAnd rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn
    unto the Lord your God:'
  '20': for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. &l14&rWho knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your God?
  '21': '&l15&rBlow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:
    &l16&rGather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather
    the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of
    his chamber, and the'
  '22': 'bride out of her closet. &l17&rLet the priests, the ministers of the Lord,
    weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord,
    and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them:
    wherefore should'
  '23': they say among the people, Where is their God? &l18&rThen will the Lord be jealous for his land, and pity his people. &l19&rYea, the Lord will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied
  '24': 'therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen: &l20&rBut
    I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land
    barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward
    the utmost'
  '25': 'sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because
    he hath done great things. &l21&rFear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the
    Lord will do great things. &l22&rBe not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the
    pastures of the'
  '26': 'wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the
    vine do yield their strength. &l23&rBe glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice
    in the Lord your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he
    will cause to come'
  '27': down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. &l24&rAnd the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. &l25&rAnd I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the
  '28': 'cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which
    I sent among you. &l26&rAnd ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise
    the name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people
    shall never be'
  '29': 'ashamed. &l27&rAnd ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that
    I am the Lord your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed. &l28&rAnd
    it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh;
    and your sons'
  '30': 'and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your
    young men shall see visions: &l29&rAnd also upon the servants and upon the handmaids
    in those days will I pour out my spirit. &l30&rAnd I will shew wonders in the
    heavens and in the'
  '31': earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. &l31&rThe sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come. &l32&rAnd it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall
  '32': 'be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as
    the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.'
  '33': 'Chapter 3

    For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity
    of Judah and Jerusalem, &l2&rI will also gather all nations, and will bring them
    down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my'
  '34': people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land. &l3&rAnd they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink. &l4&rYea, and what have ye
  '35': to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head; &l5&rBecause ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have
  '36': 'carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things: &l6&rThe children also
    of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye
    might remove them far from their border. &l7&rBehold, I will raise them out of
    the place whither ye'
  '37': 'have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head: &l8&rAnd
    I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah,
    and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the Lord hath
    spoken it.'
  '38': '&l9&rProclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty
    men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: &l10&rBeat your plowshares
    into swords and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.
    &l11&rAssemble'
  '39': 'yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round
    about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord. &l12&rLet the heathen
    be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to
    judge all the heathen'
  '40': 'round about. &l13&rPut ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get
    you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.
    &l14&rMultitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the Lord
    is near in the'
  '41': 'valley of decision. &l15&rThe sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the
    stars shall withdraw their shining. &l16&rThe Lord also shall roar out of Zion,
    and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake:
    but the Lord will be'
  '42': 'the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. &l17&rSo
    shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain:
    then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any
    more. &l18&rAnd it'
  '43': shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the Lord, and shall water the valley of
  '44': Shittim. &l19&rEgypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. &l20&rBut Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to
  '45': 'generation. &l21&rFor I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed:
    for the Lord dwelleth in Zion.'
