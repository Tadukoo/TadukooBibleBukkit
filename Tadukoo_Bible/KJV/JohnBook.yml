  '1': 'Chapter 1

    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
    &l2&rThe same was in the beginning with God. &l3&rAll things were made by him;
    and without him was not any thing made that was made. &l4&rIn him was life; and
    the'
  '2': life was the light of men. &l5&rAnd the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. &l6&rThere was a man sent from God, whose name was John. &l7&rThe same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might
  '3': believe. &l8&rHe was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. &l9&rThat was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. &l10&rHe was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
  '4': '&l11&rHe came unto his own, and his own received him not. &l12&rBut as many
    as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them
    that believe on his name: &l13&rWhich were born, not of blood, nor of the will
    of the flesh, nor of'
  '5': the will of man, but of God. &l14&rAnd the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. &l15&rJohn bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom
  '6': 'I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before
    me. &l16&rAnd of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. &l17&rFor
    the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. &l18&rNo
    man hath seen God at'
  '7': any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. &l19&rAnd this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? &l20&rAnd he confessed, and denied not; but
  '8': confessed, I am not the Christ. &l21&rAnd they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. &l22&rThen said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What
  '9': sayest thou of thyself? &l23&rHe said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. &l24&rAnd they which were sent were of the Pharisees. &l25&rAnd they asked him, and said unto him, Why
  '10': 'baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that
    prophet? &l26&rJohn answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth
    one among you, whom ye know not; &l27&rHe it is, who coming after me is preferred
    before me, whose'
  '11': shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. &l28&rThese things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. &l29&rThe next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
  '12': '&l30&rThis is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred
    before me: for he was before me. &l31&rAnd I knew him not: but that he should
    be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. &l32&rAnd
    John bare record,'
  '13': 'saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode
    upon him. &l33&rAnd I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water,
    the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining
    on him, the same'
  '14': is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. &l34&rAnd I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. &l35&rAgain the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; &l36&rAnd looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
  '15': '&l37&rAnd the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. &l38&rThen
    Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They
    said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest
    thou? &l39&rHe'
  '16': 'saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode
    with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. &l40&rOne of the two which
    heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter''s brother. &l41&rHe
    first findeth his own'
  '17': 'brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being
    interpreted, the Christ. &l42&rAnd he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld
    him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which
    is by'
  '18': interpretation, A stone. &l43&rThe day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. &l44&rNow Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. &l45&rPhilip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We
  '19': have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. &l46&rAnd Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. &l47&rJesus saw Nathanael
  '20': coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! &l48&rNathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
  '21': '&l49&rNathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God;
    thou art the King of Israel. &l50&rJesus answered and said unto him, Because I
    said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see
    greater things than'
  '22': these. &l51&rAnd he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
  '23': 'Chapter 2

    And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus
    was there: &l2&rAnd both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
    &l3&rAnd when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have
    no'
  '24': wine. &l4&rJesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. &l5&rHis mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. &l6&rAnd there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the
  '25': purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. &l7&rJesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. &l8&rAnd he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare
  '26': 'it. &l9&rWhen the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine,
    and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the
    governor of the feast called the bridegroom, &l10&rAnd saith unto him, Every man
    at the beginning'
  '27': 'doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is
    worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. &l11&rThis beginning of miracles
    did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples
    believed on him.'
  '28': '&l12&rAfter this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren,
    and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. &l13&rAnd the Jews''
    passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. &l14&rAnd found in the temple
    those that'
  '29': 'sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: &l15&rAnd
    when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple,
    and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers'' money, and overthrew
    the tables; &l16&rAnd'
  '30': said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. &l17&rAnd his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. &l18&rThen answered the Jews and said unto him,
  '31': What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? &l19&rJesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. &l20&rThen said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt
  '32': thou rear it up in three days? &l21&rBut he spake of the temple of his body. &l22&rWhen therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
  '33': '&l23&rNow when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many
    believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. &l24&rBut Jesus
    did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, &l25&rAnd needed not
    that any should'
  '34': 'testify of man: for he knew what was in man.'
  '35': 'Chapter 3

    There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: &l2&rThe
    same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a
    teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except
    God be'
  '36': with him. &l3&rJesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. &l4&rNicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his
  '37': mother's womb, and be born? &l5&rJesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. &l6&rThat which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit
  '38': 'is spirit. &l7&rMarvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
    &l8&rThe wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but
    canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is
    born of the Spirit.'
  '39': '&l9&rNicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? &l10&rJesus
    answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these
    things? &l11&rVerily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify
    that we have'
  '40': seen; and ye receive not our witness. &l12&rIf I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? &l13&rAnd no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man
  '41': 'which is in heaven. &l14&rAnd as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
    even so must the Son of man be lifted up: &l15&rThat whosoever believeth in him
    should not perish, but have eternal life. &l16&rFor God so loved the world, that
    he gave his'
  '42': only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. &l17&rFor God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. &l18&rHe that believeth on him is not
  '43': 'condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath
    not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. &l19&rAnd this is the
    condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather
    than light, because'
  '44': their deeds were evil. &l20&rFor every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. &l21&rBut he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in
  '45': 'God. &l22&rAfter these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land
    of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. &l23&rAnd John also was
    baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they
    came, and were'
  '46': baptized. &l24&rFor John was not yet cast into prison. &l25&rThen there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. &l26&rAnd they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom
  '47': thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. &l27&rJohn answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. &l28&rYe yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent
  '48': 'before him. &l29&rHe that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend
    of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of
    the bridegroom''s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. &l30&rHe must increase,
    but I must'
  '49': 'decrease. &l31&rHe that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the
    earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above
    all. &l32&rAnd what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth
    his testimony.'
  '50': '&l33&rHe that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is
    true. &l34&rFor he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth
    not the Spirit by measure unto him.'

  '1': 'Chapter 3 Cont.

    &l35&rThe Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. &l36&rHe
    that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the
    Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.'
  '2': 'Chapter 4

    When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized
    more disciples than John, &l2&r(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
    &l3&rHe left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. &l4&rAnd he must'
  '3': needs go through Samaria. &l5&rThen cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. &l6&rNow Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the
  '4': 'well: and it was about the sixth hour. &l7&rThere cometh a woman of Samaria
    to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. &l8&r(For his disciples
    were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) &l9&rThen saith the woman of Samaria
    unto him, How is it'
  '5': that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. &l10&rJesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
  '6': 'wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. &l11&rThe
    woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep:
    from whence then hast thou that living water? &l12&rArt thou greater than our
    father Jacob,'
  '7': 'which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his
    cattle? &l13&rJesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water
    shall thirst again: &l14&rBut whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give
    him shall never'
  '8': thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. &l15&rThe woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. &l16&rJesus saith unto her, Go, call
  '9': 'thy husband, and come hither. &l17&rThe woman answered and said, I have no
    husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: &l18&rFor
    thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in
    that saidst thou truly.'
  '10': ' &l19&rThe woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
    &l20&rOur fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is
    the place where men ought to worship. &l21&rJesus saith unto her, Woman, believe
    me, the hour cometh,'
  '11': 'when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the
    Father. &l22&rYe worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation
    is of the Jews. &l23&rBut the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
    shall worship the'
  '12': 'Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
    &l24&rGod is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and
    in truth. &l25&rThe woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is
    called Christ: when he'
  '13': 'is come, he will tell us all things. &l26&rJesus saith unto her, I that speak
    unto thee am he. &l27&rAnd upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he
    talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou
    with her? &l28&rThe'
  '14': 'woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to
    the men, &l29&rCome, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not
    this the Christ? &l30&rThen they went out of the city, and came unto him. &l31&rIn
    the mean while'
  '15': his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. &l32&rBut he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. &l33&rTherefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? &l34&rJesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the
  '16': will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. &l35&rSay not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. &l36&rAnd he that reapeth
  '17': 'receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that
    soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. &l37&rAnd herein is that saying
    true, One soweth, and another reapeth. &l38&rI sent you to reap that whereon ye
    bestowed no labour:'
  '18': other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. &l39&rAnd many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. &l40&rSo when the Samaritans were come unto him, they
  '19': 'besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
    &l41&rAnd many more believed because of his own word; &l42&rAnd said unto the
    woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves,
    and know that this is'
  '20': indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. &l43&rNow after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. &l44&rFor Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. &l45&rThen when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans
  '21': 'received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the
    feast: for they also went unto the feast. &l46&rSo Jesus came again into Cana
    of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose
    son was sick at'
  '22': 'Capernaum. &l47&rWhen he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee,
    he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son:
    for he was at the point of death. &l48&rThen said Jesus unto him, Except ye see
    signs and wonders,'
  '23': ye will not believe. &l49&rThe nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. &l50&rJesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. &l51&rAnd as he was now
  '24': going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. &l52&rThen enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. &l53&rSo the father knew that it was at the
  '25': 'same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself
    believed, and his whole house. &l54&rThis is again the second miracle that Jesus
    did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.'
  '26': 'Chapter 5

    After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. &l2&rNow
    there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew
    tongue Bethesda, having five porches. &l3&rIn these lay a great multitude of'
  '27': 'impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
    &l4&rFor an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the
    water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made
    whole of'
  '28': whatsoever disease he had. &l5&rAnd a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. &l6&rWhen Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? &l7&rThe impotent
  '29': 'man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put
    me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. &l8&rJesus
    saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. &l9&rAnd immediately the man
    was made whole, and'
  '30': 'took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. &l10&rThe
    Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not
    lawful for thee to carry thy bed. &l11&rHe answered them, He that made me whole,
    the same said unto'
  '31': 'me, Take up thy bed, and walk. &l12&rThen asked they him, What man is that
    which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? &l13&rAnd he that was healed
    wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in
    that place.'
  '32': '&l14&rAfterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold,
    thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. &l15&rThe
    man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. &l16&rAnd
    therefore did'
  '33': the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. &l17&rBut Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. &l18&rTherefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had
  '34': 'broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself
    equal with God. &l19&rThen answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily,
    I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father
    do: for what things'
  '35': 'soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. &l20&rFor the Father
    loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew
    him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. &l21&rFor as the Father raiseth
    up the dead, and'
  '36': 'quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. &l22&rFor the Father
    judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: &l23&rThat all men
    should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the
    Son honoureth'
  '37': not the Father which hath sent him. &l24&rVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. &l25&rVerily, verily, I
  '38': 'say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the
    voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. &l26&rFor as the Father
    hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; &l27&rAnd
    hath given him'
  '39': 'authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. &l28&rMarvel
    not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall
    hear his voice, &l29&rAnd shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
    resurrection of'
  '40': 'life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. &l30&rI
    can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just;
    because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.
    &l31&rIf I bear'
  '41': witness of myself, my witness is not true. &l32&rThere is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. &l33&rYe sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. &l34&rBut I receive not testimony from
  '42': 'man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. &l35&rHe was a burning
    and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
    &l36&rBut I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father
    hath given me to'
  '43': finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. &l37&rAnd the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. &l38&rAnd ye have not his word
  '44': 'abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. &l39&rSearch the
    scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which
    testify of me. &l40&rAnd ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. &l41&rI
    receive not honour'
  '45': 'from men. &l42&rBut I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
    &l43&rI am come in my Father''s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall
    come in his own name, him ye will receive. &l44&rHow can ye believe, which receive

    After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
    &l2&rAnd a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he
    did on them that were diseased. &l3&rAnd Jesus went up into a mountain, and there'
  '49': he sat with his disciples. &l4&rAnd the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. &l5&rWhen Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? &l6&rAnd this he said to
  '50': 'prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. &l7&rPhilip answered him,
    Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of
    them may take a little. &l8&rOne of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter''s brother,
    saith unto him,'

    &l9&rThere is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes:
    but what are they among so many? &l10&rAnd Jesus said, Make the men sit down.
    Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five'
  '2': thousand. &l11&rAnd Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. &l12&rWhen they were filled, he said unto his
  '3': disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. &l13&rTherefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. &l14&rThen
  '4': those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world. &l15&rWhen Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a
  '5': mountain himself alone. &l16&rAnd when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, &l17&rAnd entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. &l18&rAnd the sea arose by reason of
  '6': 'a great wind that blew. &l19&rSo when they had rowed about five and twenty
    or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the
    ship: and they were afraid. &l20&rBut he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
    &l21&rThen they'
  '7': 'willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the
    land whither they went. &l22&rThe day following, when the people which stood on
    the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that
    one whereinto his'
  '8': disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone; &l23&r(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given
  '9': thanks:) &l24&rWhen the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. &l25&rAnd when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when
  '10': camest thou hither? &l26&rJesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. &l27&rLabour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat
  '11': 'which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto
    you: for him hath God the Father sealed. &l28&rThen said they unto him, What shall
    we do, that we might work the works of God? &l29&rJesus answered and said unto
    them, This is the'
  '12': work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. &l30&rThey said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work? &l31&rOur fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them
  '13': bread from heaven to eat. &l32&rThen Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. &l33&rFor the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and
  '14': 'giveth life unto the world. &l34&rThen said they unto him, Lord, evermore
    give us this bread. &l35&rAnd Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he
    that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never
    thirst. &l36&rBut I said'
  '15': unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. &l37&rAll that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. &l38&rFor I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
  '16': '&l39&rAnd this is the Father''s will which hath sent me, that of all which
    he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last
    day. &l40&rAnd this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth
    the Son, and'
  '17': 'believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the
    last day. &l41&rThe Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread
    which came down from heaven. &l42&rAnd they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of
    Joseph, whose father'
  '18': 'and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?
    &l43&rJesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.
    &l44&rNo man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and
    I will raise him up'
  '19': at the last day. &l45&rIt is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. &l46&rNot that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath
  '20': seen the Father. &l47&rVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. &l48&rI am that bread of life. &l49&rYour fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. &l50&rThis is the bread which cometh down from heaven,
  '21': 'that a man may eat thereof, and not die. &l51&rI am the living bread which
    came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and
    the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the
    world. &l52&rThe Jews'
  '22': therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? &l53&rThen Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. &l54&rWhoso
  '23': eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. &l55&rFor my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. &l56&rHe that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
  '24': '&l57&rAs the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he
    that eateth me, even he shall live by me. &l58&rThis is that bread which came
    down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth
    of this bread shall'
  '25': live for ever. &l59&rThese things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. &l60&rMany therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? &l61&rWhen Jesus knew in himself that his disciples
  '26': 'murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you? &l62&rWhat and if
    ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? &l63&rIt is the spirit
    that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you,
    they are spirit, and'
  '27': they are life. &l64&rBut there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. &l65&rAnd he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given
  '28': unto him of my Father. &l66&rFrom that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. &l67&rThen said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? &l68&rThen Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of
  '29': 'eternal life. &l69&rAnd we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ,
    the Son of the living God. &l70&rJesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve,
    and one of you is a devil? &l71&rHe spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon:
    for he it was that'
  '30': should betray him, being one of the twelve.
  '31': 'Chapter 7

    After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because
    the Jews sought to kill him. &l2&rNow the Jew''s feast of tabernacles was at hand.
    &l3&rHis brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea,'
  '32': that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. &l4&rFor there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. &l5&rFor neither did his brethren believe in
  '33': 'him. &l6&rThen Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time
    is alway ready. &l7&rThe world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify
    of it, that the works thereof are evil. &l8&rGo ye up unto this feast: I go not
    up yet unto this'
  '34': 'feast: for my time is not yet full come. &l9&rWhen he had said these words
    unto them, he abode still in Galilee. &l10&rBut when his brethren were gone up,
    then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. &l11&rThen
    the Jews sought'
  '35': 'him at the feast, and said, Where is he? &l12&rAnd there was much murmuring
    among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said,
    Nay; but he deceiveth the people. &l13&rHowbeit no man spake openly of him for
    fear of the Jews.'
  '36': '&l14&rNow about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and
    taught. &l15&rAnd the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having
    never learned? &l16&rJesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but
    his that sent me.'
  '37': '&l17&rIf any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether
    it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. &l18&rHe that speaketh of himself
    seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is
    true, and no'
  '38': 'unrighteousness is in him. &l19&rDid not Moses give you the law, and yet
    none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? &l20&rThe people answered
    and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? &l21&rJesus answered
    and said unto them,'
  '39': I have done one work, and ye all marvel. &l22&rMoses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. &l23&rIf a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of
  '40': Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? &l24&rJudge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. &l25&rThen said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they
  '41': 'seek to kill? &l26&rBut, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto
    him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? &l27&rHowbeit we
    know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
    &l28&rThen cried Jesus'
  '42': 'in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I
    am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
    &l29&rBut I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. &l30&rThen they
    sought to take him: but'
  '43': no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. &l31&rAnd many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? &l32&rThe Pharisees heard that the people murmured such
  '44': 'things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers
    to take him. &l33&rThen said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you,
    and then I go unto him that sent me. &l34&rYe shall seek me, and shall not find
    me: and where I am,'
  '45': thither ye cannot come. &l35&rThen said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? &l36&rWhat manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me,
  '46': 'and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? &l37&rIn the
    last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man
    thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. &l38&rHe that believeth on me, as the
    scripture hath said,'
  '47': 'out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. &l39&r(But this spake
    he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy
    Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) &l40&rMany
    of the people therefore,'
  '48': when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. &l41&rOthers said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? &l42&rHath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of
  '49': Bethlehem, where David was? &l43&rSo there was a division among the people because of him. &l44&rAnd some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. &l45&rThen came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them,
  '50': Why have ye not brought him? &l46&rThe officers answered, Never man spake like this man. &l47&rThen answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? &l48&rHave any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?

    Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. &l2&rAnd early in the morning he came again
    into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught
    them. &l3&rAnd the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery;'
  '4': 'and when they had set her in the midst, &l4&rThey say unto him, Master, this
    woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. &l5&rNow Moses in the law commanded
    us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? &l6&rThis they said, tempting
    him, that'
  '5': they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. &l7&rSo when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first
  '6': 'cast a stone at her. &l8&rAnd again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
    &l9&rAnd they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out
    one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone,
    and the woman'
  '7': standing in the midst. &l10&rWhen Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? &l11&rShe said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn
  '8': 'thee: go, and sin no more. &l12&rThen spake Jesus again unto them, saying,
    I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
    but shall have the light of life. &l13&rThe Pharisees therefore said unto him,
    Thou bearest record of'
  '9': 'thyself; thy record is not true. &l14&rJesus answered and said unto them,
    Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came,
    and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. &l15&rYe
    judge after the flesh;'
  '10': 'I judge no man. &l16&rAnd yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not
    alone, but I and the Father that sent me. &l17&rIt is also written in your law,
    that the testimony of two men is true. &l18&rI am one that bear witness of myself,
    and the Father'
  '11': 'that sent me beareth witness of me. &l19&rThen said they unto him, Where
    is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known
    me, ye should have known my Father also. &l20&rThese words spake Jesus in the
    treasury, as he taught'
  '12': 'in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
    &l21&rThen said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and
    shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. &l22&rThen said the Jews,
    Will he kill himself?'
  '13': 'because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. &l23&rAnd he said unto them,
    Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
    &l24&rI said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe
    not that I'
  '14': 'am he, ye shall die in your sins. &l25&rThen said they unto him, Who art
    thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.
    &l26&rI have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true;
    and I speak'
  '15': to the world those things which I have heard of him. &l27&rThey understood not that he spake to them of the Father. &l28&rThen said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself;
  '16': 'but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. &l29&rAnd he that
    sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things
    that please him. &l30&rAs he spake these words, many believed on him. &l31&rThen

  '18': 'sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? &l34&rJesus answered them, Verily, verily,
    I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. &l35&rAnd the
    servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. &l36&rIf
    the Son therefore'
  '19': 'shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. &l37&rI know that ye are Abraham''s
    seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. &l38&rI speak
    that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with
    your father.'
  '20': '&l39&rThey answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith
    unto them, If ye were Abraham''s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. &l40&rBut
    now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard
    of God: this did'
  '21': 'not Abraham. &l41&rYe do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him,
    We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. &l42&rJesus said
    unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and
    came from God; neither'
  '22': came I of myself, but he sent me. &l43&rWhy do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. &l44&rYe are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the
  '23': 'truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh
    of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. &l45&rAnd because I tell you
    the truth, ye believe me not. &l46&rWhich of you convinceth me of sin? And if
    I say the truth, why'
  '24': 'do ye not believe me? &l47&rHe that is of God heareth God''s words: ye therefore
    hear them not, because ye are not of God. &l48&rThen answered the Jews, and said
    unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? &l49&rJesus
    answered, I'
  '25': 'have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. &l50&rAnd
    I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. &l51&rVerily,
    verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. &l52&rThen
    said the Jews'
  '26': 'unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets;
    and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. &l53&rArt
    thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead:
    whom makest'

    it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: &l55&rYet
    ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I
    shall be a liar'
  '28': 'like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. &l56&rYour father Abraham
    rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad. &l57&rThen said the Jews
    unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? &l58&rJesus
    said unto them,'
  '29': 'Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. &l59&rThen took
    they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple,
    going through the midst of them, and so passed by.'
  '30': 'Chapter 9

    And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. &l2&rAnd
    his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents,
    that he was born blind? &l3&rJesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor
    his'
  '31': 'parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. &l4&rI
    must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when
    no man can work. &l5&rAs long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
    &l6&rWhen he had'
  '32': thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, &l7&rAnd said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed,
  '33': 'and came seeing. &l8&rThe neighbours therefore, and they which before had
    seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? &l9&rSome
    said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. &l10&rTherefore
    said they unto'
  '34': 'him, How were thine eyes opened? &l11&rHe answered and said, A man that is
    called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool
    of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. &l12&rThen said
    they unto him,'
  '35': Where is he? He said, I know not. &l13&rThey brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. &l14&rAnd it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. &l15&rThen again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight.
  '36': He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. &l16&rTherefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was
  '37': a division among them. &l17&rThey say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. &l18&rBut the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they
  '38': called the parents of him that had received his sight. &l19&rAnd they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? &l20&rHis parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born
  '39': 'blind: &l21&rBut by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened
    his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. &l22&rThese
    words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed
    already, that'
  '40': 'if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
    &l23&rTherefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. &l24&rThen again called
    they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that
    this man is'
  '41': 'a sinner. &l25&rHe answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know
    not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. &l26&rThen said they
    to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? &l27&rHe answered
    them, I have told'
  '42': 'you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will
    ye also be his disciples? &l28&rThen they reviled him, and said, Thou art his
    disciple; but we are Moses'' disciples. &l29&rWe know that God spake unto Moses:
    as for this fellow, we'
  '43': 'know not from whence he is. &l30&rThe man answered and said unto them, Why
    herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath
    opened mine eyes. &l31&rNow we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man
    be a worshipper of'
  '44': God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. &l32&rSince the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. &l33&rIf this man were not of God, he could do nothing. &l34&rThey answered and said unto him, Thou wast
  '45': altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. &l35&rJesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? &l36&rHe answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I
  '46': might believe on him? &l37&rAnd Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. &l38&rAnd he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. &l39&rAnd Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see
  '47': 'not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. &l40&rAnd some
    of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are
    we blind also? &l41&rJesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no
    sin: but now ye say, We'
  '48': see; therefore your sin remaineth.

    have it more abundantly. &l11&rI am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth

    know my sheep, and am known of mine. &l15&rAs the Father knoweth me, even so know
    I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. &l16&rAnd other sheep I have,
    which are not of'
  '6': 'this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there
    shall be one fold, and one shepherd. &l17&rTherefore doth my Father love me, because

    but I lay it'
  '7': down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. &l19&rThere was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. &l20&rAnd many of them said, He hath a devil, and is
  '8': mad; why hear ye him? &l21&rOthers said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? &l22&rAnd it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. &l23&rAnd Jesus walked in the temple in
  '9': 'Solomon''s porch. &l24&rThen came the Jews round about him, and said unto
    him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
    &l25&rJesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do
    in my Father''s name,'
  '10': 'they bear witness of me. &l26&rBut ye believe not, because ye are not of
    my sheep, as I said unto you. &l27&rMy sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and
    they follow me: &l28&rAnd I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never

  '11': any man pluck them out of my hand. &l29&rMy Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. &l30&rI and my Father are one. &l31&rThen the Jews took up stones again to stone him. &l32&rJesus
  '12': answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? &l33&rThe Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
  '13': '&l34&rJesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are
    gods? &l35&rIf he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture
    cannot be broken; &l36&rSay ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent
    into the world,'
  '14': 'Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? &l37&rIf I do not

  '15': '&l39&rTherefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their
    hand, &l40&rAnd went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first
    baptized; and there he abode. &l41&rAnd many resorted unto him, and said, John
    did no miracle: but'

  '17': 'Chapter 11

    Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her
    sister Martha. &l2&r(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and
    wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) &l3&rTherefore
    his'
  '18': sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. &l4&rWhen Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. &l5&rNow Jesus loved Martha, and her
  '19': sister, and Lazarus. &l6&rWhen he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. &l7&rThen after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. &l8&rHis disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews
  '20': of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? &l9&rJesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. &l10&rBut if a man walk in the night, he
  '21': 'stumbleth, because there is no light in him. &l11&rThese things said he:
    and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that
    I may awake him out of sleep. &l12&rThen said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep,
    he shall do well.'
  '22': '&l13&rHowbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken
    of taking of rest in sleep. &l14&rThen said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is
    dead. &l15&rAnd I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye
    may believe;'
  '23': nevertheless let us go unto him. &l16&rThen said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. &l17&rThen when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. &l18&rNow Bethany
  '24': 'was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: &l19&rAnd many of the
    Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. &l20&rThen
    Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary
    sat still in the'
  '25': house. &l21&rThen said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. &l22&rBut I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. &l23&rJesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
  '26': '&l24&rMartha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection
    at the last day. &l25&rJesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:
    he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: &l26&rAnd whosoever
    liveth'
  '27': 'and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? &l27&rShe saith
    unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which
    should come into the world. &l28&rAnd when she had so said, she went her way,
    and called Mary her'
  '28': sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. &l29&rAs soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. &l30&rNow Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. &l31&rThe Jews then which
  '29': were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. &l32&rThen when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet,
  '30': saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. &l33&rWhen Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled. &l34&rAnd said, Where have ye laid him? They
  '31': said unto him, Lord, come and see. &l35&rJesus wept. &l36&rThen said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! &l37&rAnd some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? &l38&rJesus
  '32': 'therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and
    a stone lay upon it. &l39&rJesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister
    of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath
    been dead four'
  '33': days. &l40&rJesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? &l41&rThen they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank
  '34': 'thee that thou hast heard me. &l42&rAnd I knew that thou hearest me always:
    but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that
    thou hast sent me. &l43&rAnd when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
    Lazarus, come'
  '35': 'forth. &l44&rAnd he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes:
    and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him,
    and let him go. &l45&rThen many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
    things which'
  '36': Jesus did, believed on him. &l46&rBut some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. &l47&rThen gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.
  '37': '&l48&rIf we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans
    shall come and take away both our place and nation. &l49&rAnd one of them, named
    Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing
    at all, &l50&rNor'
  '38': 'consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people,
    and that the whole nation perish not. &l51&rAnd this spake he not of himself:
    but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that
    nation; &l52&rAnd not'
  '39': for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. &l53&rThen from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death. &l54&rJesus therefore walked no more openly among the
  '40': 'Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city
    called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. &l55&rAnd the Jews'' passover
    was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the
    passover, to purify'
  '41': themselves. &l56&rThen sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? &l57&rNow both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew
  '42': where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.
  '43': 'Chapter 12

    Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which
    had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. &l2&rThere they made him a supper;
    and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.'
  '44': '&l3&rThen took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed
    the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled
    with the odour of the ointment. &l4&rThen saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot,
    Simon''s son,'
  '45': which should betray him, &l5&rWhy was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? &l6&rThis he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. &l7&rThen said
  '46': 'Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. &l8&rFor
    the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. &l9&rMuch people
    of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus'' sake
    only, but that'
  '47': they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. &l10&rBut the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; &l11&rBecause that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. &l12&rOn the next day
  '48': 'much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming
    to Jerusalem, &l13&rTook branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and
    cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.
    &l14&rAnd'
  '49': 'Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, &l15&rFear
    not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass''s colt. &l16&rThese
    things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified,
    then'
  '50': remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. &l17&rThe people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.

    &l18&rFor this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had
    done this miracle. &l19&rThe Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive
    ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. &l20&rAnd there'
  '2': 'were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: &l21&rThe

  '6': 'will glorify it again. &l29&rThe people therefore, that stood by, and heard
    it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. &l30&rJesus answered
    and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. &l31&rNow is
    the judgment of'
  '7': 'this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. &l32&rAnd I, if
    I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. &l33&rThis he said,
    signifying what death he should die. &l34&rThe people answered him, We have heard
    out of the law that'
  '8': 'Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted
    up? who is this Son of man? &l35&rThen Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while
    is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you:
    for he that'
  '9': walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. &l36&rWhile ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. &l37&rBut though he had done so many miracles
  '10': 'before them, yet they believed not on him: &l38&rThat the saying of Esaias
    the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report?
    and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? &l39&rTherefore they could
    not believe,'

    believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they
    should be put out of the synagogue: &l43&rFor they loved the praise of men more
    than the praise'
  '13': of God. &l44&rJesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. &l45&rAnd he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. &l46&rI am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in

    Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that
    he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which
    were in the world, he loved them unto the end. &l2&rAnd supper being ended, the'
  '18': devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; &l3&rJesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; &l4&rHe riseth from supper, and laid aside his
  '19': 'garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. &l5&rAfter that he poureth
    water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples'' feet, and to wipe them with
    the towel wherewith he was girded. &l6&rThen cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter
    saith unto him,'
  '20': Lord, dost thou wash my feet? &l7&rJesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. &l8&rPeter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
  '21': ' &l9&rSimon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands
    and my head. &l10&rJesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash
    his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. &l11&rFor he
    knew who should'
  '22': 'betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. &l12&rSo after he had
    washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said
    unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? &l13&rYe call me Master and Lord:
    and ye say well; for so'
  '23': I am. &l14&rIf I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. &l15&rFor I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. &l16&rVerily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater
  '24': 'than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. &l17&rIf
    ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. &l18&rI speak not of you all:
    I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth
    bread with me'
  '25': hath lifted up his heel against me. &l19&rNow I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he. &l20&rVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth
  '26': him that sent me. &l21&rWhen Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. &l22&rThen the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. &l23&rNow
  '27': there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. &l24&rSimon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. &l25&rHe then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? &l26&rJesus
  '28': answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. &l27&rAnd after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.
  '29': '&l28&rNow no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
    &l29&rFor some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said
    unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he
    should give something'
  '30': 'to the poor. &l30&rHe then having received the sop went immediately out:
    and it was night. &l31&rTherefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the
    Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. &l32&rIf God be glorified in
    him, God shall also'
  '31': 'glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him. &l33&rLittle children,
    yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews,
    Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. &l34&rA new commandment I give
    unto you,'
  '32': That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. &l35&rBy this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. &l36&rSimon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither
  '33': I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. &l37&rPeter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. &l38&rJesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily,
  '34': I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.

    I go to prepare a place for you. &l3&rAnd if I go and prepare a place for you,
    I will'
  '36': come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. &l4&rAnd whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. &l5&rThomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? &l6&rJesus saith unto him, I
  '37': 'am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by
    me. &l7&rIf ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth
    ye know him, and have seen him. &l8&rPhilip saith unto him, Lord, show us the
    Father, and it'
  '38': sufficeth us. &l9&rJesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? &l10&rBelievest thou not that I am in the Father,
  '39': 'and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself:
    but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. &l11&rBelieve me that
    I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works''
    sake. &l12&rVerily,'
  '40': verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. &l13&rAnd whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in
  '41': the Son. &l14&rIf ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. &l15&rIf ye love me, keep my commandments. &l16&rAnd I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; &l17&rEven the Spirit of truth;
  '42': 'whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth
    him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. &l18&rI will
    not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. &l19&rYet a little while, and the
    world seeth me no'
  '43': 'more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. &l20&rAt that day
    ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. &l21&rHe that
    hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth
    me shall be loved'
  '44': of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. &l22&rJudas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? &l23&rJesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will
  '45': 'keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and
    make our abode with him. &l24&rHe that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and
    the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father''s which sent me. &l25&rThese
    things have I spoken'
  '46': unto you, being yet present with you. &l26&rBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. &l27&rPeace I leave with
  '47': 'you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.
    Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. &l28&rYe have heard
    how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would
    rejoice, because I'
  '48': 'said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I. &l29&rAnd now
    I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might
    believe. &l30&rHereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this
    world cometh, and hath'
  '49': nothing in me. &l31&rBut that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.

    asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
    &l25&rThese'

    have kept thy word.'

  '37': hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. &l15&rI pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. &l16&rThey are not of the world, even as I am not of the
  '38': 'world. &l17&rSanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. &l18&rAs
    thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.
    &l19&rAnd for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified
    through the truth.'
  '39': '&l20&rNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe
    on me through their word; &l21&rThat they all may be one; as thou, Father, art

  '43': 'Chapter 18

    When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook
    Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. &l2&rAnd
    Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted'
  '44': thither with his disciples. &l3&rJudas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. &l4&rJesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went
  '45': forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? &l5&rThey answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. &l6&rAs soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to
  '46': 'the ground. &l7&rThen asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus
    of Nazareth. &l8&rJesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye
    seek me, let these go their way: &l9&rThat the saying might be fulfilled, which
    he spake, Of them'
  '47': 'which thou gavest me have I lost none. &l10&rThen Simon Peter having a sword
    drew it, and smote the high priest''s servant, and cut off his right ear. The
    servant''s name was Malchus. &l11&rThen said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword
    into the sheath: the'
  '48': cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? &l12&rThen the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, &l13&rAnd led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that
  '49': 'same year. &l14&rNow Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that
    it was expedient that one man should die for the people. &l15&rAnd Simon Peter
    followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the
    high priest, and went in'
  '50': with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. &l16&rBut Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.

    &l17&rThen saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one
    of this man''s disciples? He saith, I am not. &l18&rAnd the servants and officers
    stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed'
  '2': 'themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself. &l19&rThe high
    priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine. &l20&rJesus answered
    him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple,
    whither the'
  '3': 'Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. &l21&rWhy askest thou
    me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what
    I said. &l22&rAnd when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by
    struck Jesus with the'
  '4': 'palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? &l23&rJesus answered
    him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest
    thou me? &l24&rNow Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. &l25&rAnd
    Simon'
  '5': Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. &l26&rOne of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in
  '6': 'the garden with him? &l27&rPeter then denied again: and immediately the cock
    crew. &l28&rThen led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it
    was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should
    be defiled; but'
  '7': that they might eat the passover. &l29&rPilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? &l30&rThey answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. &l31&rThen said
  '8': 'Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews
    therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: &l32&rThat
    the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death
    he should die.'
  '9': '&l33&rThen Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus,
    and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? &l34&rJesus answered him, Sayest
    thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? &l35&rPilate answered,
    Am I a Jew?'
  '10': 'Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what
    hast thou done? &l36&rJesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom
    were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered
    to the Jews: but'
  '11': now is my kingdom not from hence. &l37&rPilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every
  '12': one that is of the truth heareth my voice. &l38&rPilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. &l39&rBut ye have a custom, that I should release unto
  '13': 'you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King
    of the Jews? &l40&rThen cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas.
    Now Barabbas was a robber.'
  '14': 'Chapter 19

    Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. &l2&rAnd the soldiers platted
    a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
    &l3&rAnd said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.'
  '15': '&l4&rPilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring
    him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. &l5&rThen came
    Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith
    unto them, Behold'
  '16': 'the man! &l6&rWhen the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they
    cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him,
    and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. &l7&rThe Jews answered him, We have
    a law, and by our'
  '17': law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. &l8&rWhen Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; &l9&rAnd went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. &l10&rThen
  '18': 'saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I
    have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? &l11&rJesus answered,
    Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from
    above: therefore he'
  '19': 'that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. &l12&rAnd from thenceforth
    Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this
    man go, thou art not Caesar''s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh
    against Caesar.'
  '20': '&l13&rWhen Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and
    sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the
    Hebrew, Gabbatha. &l14&rAnd it was the preparation of the passover, and about
    the sixth hour: and he'
  '21': saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! &l15&rBut they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. &l16&rThen delivered he him therefore
  '22': 'unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. &l17&rAnd
    he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which
    is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: &l18&rWhere they crucified him, and two other
    with him, on either'
  '23': 'side one, and Jesus in the midst. &l19&rAnd Pilate wrote a title, and put
    it on the cross. And the writing was Jesus Of Nazareth The King Of The Jews. &l20&rThis
    title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was
    nigh to the'
  '24': 'city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. &l21&rThen said
    the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but
    that he said, I am King of the Jews. &l22&rPilate answered, What I have written
    I have written.'
  '25': '&l23&rThen the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments,
    and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat
    was without seam, woven from the top throughout. &l24&rThey said therefore among
    themselves, Let us not'
  '26': 'rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might
    be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture
    they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did. &l25&rNow there stood
    by the cross of'
  '27': Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. &l26&rWhen Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! &l27&rThen saith he to the
  '28': disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. &l28&rAfter this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. &l29&rNow there was set a vessel full
  '29': 'of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop,
    and put it to his mouth. &l30&rWhen Jesus therefore had received the vinegar,
    he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. &l31&rThe
    Jews therefore,'
  '30': because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. &l32&rThen came the soldiers,
  '31': 'and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with
    him. &l33&rBut when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they
    brake not his legs: &l34&rBut one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side,
    and forthwith came'
  '32': 'there out blood and water. &l35&rAnd he that saw it bare record, and his
    record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. &l36&rFor
    these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him
    shall not be broken.'
  '33': '&l37&rAnd again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they
    pierced. &l38&rAnd after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus,
    but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the
    body of Jesus: and'
  '34': Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. &l39&rAnd there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. &l40&rThen took they the body of
  '35': Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. &l41&rNow in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. &l42&rThere laid they Jesus
  '36': therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
  '37': 'Chapter 20

    The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto
    the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. &l2&rThen she
    runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved,'
  '38': 'and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre,
    and we know not where they have laid him. &l3&rPeter therefore went forth, and
    that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. &l4&rSo they ran both together:
    and the other disciple'
  '39': did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. &l5&rAnd he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. &l6&rThen cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
  '40': '&l7&rAnd the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes,
    but wrapped together in a place by itself. &l8&rThen went in also that other disciple,
    which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. &l9&rFor as yet they
    knew'
  '41': 'not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. &l10&rThen the
    disciples went away again unto their own home. &l11&rBut Mary stood without at
    the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the
    sepulchre, &l12&rAnd seeth'
  '42': two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. &l13&rAnd they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have
  '43': laid him. &l14&rAnd when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. &l15&rJesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir,
  '44': if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. &l16&rJesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. &l17&rJesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet
  '45': 'ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend
    unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. &l18&rMary Magdalene
    came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken
    these things unto'
  '46': her. &l19&rThen the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. &l20&rAnd when he had so
  '47': 'said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples
    glad, when they saw the Lord. &l21&rThen said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto
    you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. &l22&rAnd when he had said
    this, he breathed on'
  '48': 'them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: &l23&rWhose soever
    sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they
    are retained. &l24&rBut Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with
    them when Jesus came.'
  '49': ' &l25&rThe other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord.
    But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails,
    and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side,
    I will not believe.'
  '50': '&l26&rAnd after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with
    them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said,
    Peace be unto you.'

    &l27&rThen saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and
    reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
    &l28&rAnd Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.'
  '2': '&l29&rJesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed:
    blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. &l30&rAnd many other
    signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written
    in this book:'
  '3': '&l31&rBut these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
    the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.'
  '4': 'Chapter 21

    After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias;
    and on this wise shewed he himself. &l2&rThere were together Simon Peter, and
    Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of'
  '5': Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. &l3&rSimon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. &l4&rBut when the morning was now
  '6': 'come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
    &l5&rThen Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him,
    No. &l6&rAnd he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and
    ye shall find.'
  '7': They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. &l7&rTherefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him,
  '8': (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. &l8&rAnd the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. &l9&rAs soon then as they were come to land, they
  '9': 'saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. &l10&rJesus saith
    unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. &l11&rSimon Peter went
    up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three:
    and for all'
  '10': there were so many, yet was not the net broken. &l12&rJesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. &l13&rJesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
  '11': '&l14&rThis is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples,
    after that he was risen from the dead. &l15&rSo when they had dined, Jesus saith
    to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith
    unto him, Yea, Lord;'
  '12': thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. &l16&rHe saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. &l17&rHe saith
  '13': unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my
  '14': 'sheep. &l18&rVerily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
    girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old,
    thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee
    whither thou wouldest'
  '15': not. &l19&rThis spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. &l20&rThen Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper,
  '16': and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? &l21&rPeter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? &l22&rJesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. &l23&rThen went this saying
  '17': 'abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said
    not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what
    is that to thee? &l24&rThis is the disciple which testifieth of these things,
    and wrote these'
  '18': 'things: and we know that his testimony is true. &l25&rAnd there are also
    many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every
    one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should
    be written. Amen.'
