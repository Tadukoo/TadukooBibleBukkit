  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, &l2&rArise,
    go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come
    up before me. &l3&rBut Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of
    the'
  '2': 'Lord, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he
    paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from
    the presence of the Lord. &l4&rBut the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea,
    and there was a'
  '3': mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. &l5&rThen the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the
  '4': sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. &l6&rSo the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not. &l7&rAnd they said every one to his
  '5': fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. &l8&rThen said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation?
  '6': and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou? &l9&rAnd he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. &l10&rThen were the men exceedingly afraid, and said
  '7': unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them. &l11&rThen said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.
  '8': ' &l12&rAnd he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea;
    so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest
    is upon you. &l13&rNevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but
    they could not: for'
  '9': 'the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them. &l14&rWherefore they cried
    unto the Lord, and said, We beseech thee, O Lord, we beseech thee, let us not
    perish for this man''s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O Lord,
    hast done as it'
  '10': 'pleased thee. &l15&rSo they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea:
    and the sea ceased from her raging. &l16&rThen the men feared the Lord exceedingly,
    and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord, and made vows. &l17&rNow the Lord had prepared
    a great'
  '11': fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
  '12': 'Chapter 2

    Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish''s belly, &l2&rAnd said,
    I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the
    belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. &l3&rFor thou hadst cast me
    into'
  '13': 'the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all
    thy billows and thy waves passed over me. &l4&rThen I said, I am cast out of thy
    sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. &l5&rThe waters compassed
    me about, even to the'
  '14': 'soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
    &l6&rI went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was
    about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O Lord my
    God. &l7&rWhen my soul'
  '15': 'fainted within me I remembered the Lord: and my prayer came in unto thee,
    into thine holy temple. &l8&rThey that observe lying vanities forsake their own
    mercy. &l9&rBut I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will
    pay that that I have'
  '16': vowed. Salvation is of the Lord. &l10&rAnd the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
  '17': 'Chapter 3

    And the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time, saying, &l2&rArise,
    go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid
    thee. &l3&rSo Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the
    Lord. Now'
  '18': Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey. &l4&rAnd Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. &l5&rSo the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a
  '19': fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. &l6&rFor word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. &l7&rAnd he caused
  '20': 'it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king
    and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing:
    let them not feed, nor drink water: &l8&rBut let man and beast be covered with
    sackcloth, and'
  '21': 'cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and
    from the violence that is in their hands. &l9&rWho can tell if God will turn and
    repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? &l10&rAnd God
    saw their works, that'
  '22': they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.
  '23': 'Chapter 4

    But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. &l2&rAnd he prayed
    unto the Lord, and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my saying, when I was
    yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou
    art a'
  '24': gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. &l3&rTherefore now, O Lord, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. &l4&rThen said the Lord, Doest thou well to be
  '25': angry? &l5&rSo Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. &l6&rAnd the Lord God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up
  '26': over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. &l7&rBut God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. &l8&rAnd it came to
  '27': pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. &l9&rAnd God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to
  '28': 'be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.
    &l10&rThen said the Lord, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou
    hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished
    in a night:'
  '29': '&l11&rAnd should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than
    sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their
    left hand; and also much cattle?'
