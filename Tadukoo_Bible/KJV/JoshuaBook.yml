    Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass, that the
    Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses'' minister, saying, &l2&rMoses my
    servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this
    people,'
  '2': unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. &l3&rEvery place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. &l4&rFrom the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the
  '3': 'river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward
    the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. &l5&rThere shall not any man be
    able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I
    will be with thee: I'
  '4': 'will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. &l6&rBe strong and of a good courage:
    for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware
    unto their fathers to give them. &l7&rOnly be thou strong and very courageous,
    that thou mayest'
  '5': 'observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee:
    turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever
    thou goest. &l8&rThis book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou
    shalt'
  '6': 'meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to
    all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and
    then thou shalt have good success. &l9&rHave not I commanded thee? Be strong and
    of a good courage; be'
  '7': 'not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever
    thou goest. &l10&rThen Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, &l11&rPass
    through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within'
  '8': three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it. &l12&rAnd to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, &l13&rRemember the word
  '9': which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land. &l14&rYour wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye
  '10': 'shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and
    help them; &l15&rUntil the Lord have given your brethren rest, as he hath given
    you, and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God giveth them:
    then ye shall return'
  '11': unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the Lord's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising. &l16&rAnd they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
  '12': ' &l17&rAccording as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken
    unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses. &l18&rWhosoever
    he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words
    in all'
  '13': 'that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of
    a good courage.'
  '14': 'Chapter 2

    And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying,
    Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot''s house,
    named Rahab, and lodged there. &l2&rAnd it was told the king of Jericho, saying,'
  '15': 'Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search
    out the country. &l3&rAnd the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth
    the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be
    come to search'
  '16': 'out all the country. &l4&rAnd the woman took the two men, and hid them, and
    said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were: &l5&rAnd it
    came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the
    men went out:'
  '17': 'whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake
    them. &l6&rBut she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them
    with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof. &l7&rAnd the
    men pursued'
  '18': 'after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued
    after them were gone out, they shut the gate. &l8&rAnd before they were laid down,
    she came up unto them upon the roof; &l9&rAnd she said unto the men, I know that
    the Lord hath'
  '19': given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. &l10&rFor we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the
  '20': 'two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and
    Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. &l11&rAnd as soon as we had heard these things,
    our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because
    of you: for the Lord'
  '21': 'your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath. &l12&rNow therefore,
    I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord, since I have shewed you kindness, that
    ye will also shew kindness unto my father''s house, and give me a true token:
    &l13&rAnd that ye'
  '22': will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death. &l14&rAnd the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the Lord hath
  '23': 'given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee. &l15&rThen
    she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town
    wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. &l16&rAnd she said unto them, Get you to the
    mountain, lest the'
  '24': 'pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers
    be returned: and afterward may ye go your way. &l17&rAnd the men said unto her,
    We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear. &l18&rBehold,
    when we come'
  '25': 'into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window
    which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother,
    and thy brethren, and all thy father''s household, home unto thee. &l19&rAnd it
    shall be, that'
  '26': 'whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood
    shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with
    thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him. &l20&rAnd
    if thou utter'
  '27': 'this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made
    us to swear. &l21&rAnd she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she
    sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
    &l22&rAnd they went,'
  '28': 'and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers
    were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found
    them not. &l23&rSo the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
    passed over, and came to'
  '29': 'Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them: &l24&rAnd
    they said unto Joshua, Truly the Lord hath delivered into our hands all the land;
    for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.'
  '30': 'Chapter 3

    And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came
    to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed
    over. &l2&rAnd it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through
    the'
  '31': host; &l3&rAnd they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it. &l4&rYet there shall be a space between you and it,
  '32': 'about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may
    know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
    &l5&rAnd Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the Lord
    will do wonders among'
  '33': you. &l6&rAnd Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people. &l7&rAnd the Lord said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to
  '34': magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. &l8&rAnd thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall
  '35': stand still in Jordan. &l9&rAnd Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the Lord your God. &l10&rAnd Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before
  '36': you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites. &l11&rBehold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan. &l12&rNow therefore
  '37': take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man. &l13&rAnd it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that
  '38': the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap. &l14&rAnd it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant
  '39': before the people; &l15&rAnd as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,) &l16&rThat the waters which
  '40': 'came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city
    Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,
    even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right
    against Jericho.'
  '41': '&l17&rAnd the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood
    firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over
    on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.'
  '42': 'Chapter 4

    And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the
    Lord spake unto Joshua, saying, &l2&rTake you twelve men out of the people, out
    of every tribe a man, &l3&rAnd command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of
    the'
  '43': midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night. &l4&rThen Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared
  '44': 'of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: &l5&rAnd Joshua said
    unto them, Pass over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan,
    and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the
    number of the tribes'
  '45': 'of the children of Israel: &l6&rThat this may be a sign among you, that when
    your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these
    stones? &l7&rThen ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off
    before the ark of the'
  '46': 'covenant of the Lord; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were
    cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel
    for ever. &l8&rAnd the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took
    up twelve stones out of'
  '47': the midst of Jordan, as the Lord spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. &l9&rAnd Joshua set up twelve stones in the
  '48': 'midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the
    ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day. &l10&rFor the priests
    which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until everything was finished
    that the Lord'
  '49': 'commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded
    Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over. &l11&rAnd it came to pass, when
    all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the Lord passed over, and
    the priests, in'
  '50': 'the presence of the people. &l12&rAnd the children of Reuben, and the children
    of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children
    of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:'

    &l13&rAbout forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the Lord unto battle,
    to the plains of Jericho. &l14&rOn that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight
    of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days'
  '2': of his life. &l15&rAnd the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying, &l16&rCommand the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan. &l17&rJoshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan. &l18&rAnd it came to
  '3': pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his
  '4': banks, as they did before. &l19&rAnd the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho. &l20&rAnd those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.
  '5': '&l21&rAnd he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children
    shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? &l22&rThen
    ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
    &l23&rFor the'
  '6': 'Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were
    passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before
    us, until we were gone over: &l24&rThat all the people of the earth might know
    the hand of the'
  '7': 'Lord, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the Lord your God for ever.'
  '8': 'Chapter 5

    And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side
    of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea,
    heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children
    of'
  '9': Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel. &l2&rAt that time the Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the
  '10': 'second time. &l3&rAnd Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children
    of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. &l4&rAnd this is the cause why Joshua
    did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all
    the men of war,'
  '11': 'died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt. &l5&rNow
    all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born
    in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not
    circumcised. &l6&rFor'
  '12': 'the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the
    people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they
    obeyed not the voice of the Lord: unto whom the Lord sware that he would not shew
    them the land,'
  '13': 'which the Lord sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that
    floweth with milk and honey. &l7&rAnd their children, whom he raised up in their
    stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had
    not circumcised them'
  '14': by the way. &l8&rAnd it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole. &l9&rAnd the Lord said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.
  '15': Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day. &l10&rAnd the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho. &l11&rAnd they did eat of the old corn of the
  '16': land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day. &l12&rAnd the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of
  '17': 'the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. &l13&rAnd it came to pass, when
    Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there
    stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went
    unto him, and said'
  '18': unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? &l14&rAnd he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant? &l15&rAnd
  '19': the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.
  '20': 'Chapter 6

    Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went
    out, and none came in. &l2&rAnd the Lord said unto Joshua, See, I have given into
    thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour. &l3&rAnd
    ye'
  '21': 'shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once.
    Thus shalt thou do six days. &l4&rAnd seven priests shall bear before the ark
    seven trumpets of rams'' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city
    seven times, and the'
  '22': priests shall blow with the trumpets. &l5&rAnd it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down
  '23': flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him. &l6&rAnd Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord.
  '24': ' &l7&rAnd he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let
    him that is armed pass on before the ark of the Lord. &l8&rAnd it came to pass,
    when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven
    trumpets of rams'''
  '25': 'horns passed on before the Lord, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark
    of the covenant of the Lord followed them. &l9&rAnd the armed men went before
    the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark,
    the priests going on, and'
  '26': blowing with the trumpets. &l10&rAnd Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout. &l11&rSo the ark of
  '27': 'the Lord compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the
    camp, and lodged in the camp. &l12&rAnd Joshua rose early in the morning, and
    the priests took up the ark of the Lord. &l13&rAnd seven priests bearing seven
    trumpets of rams'' horns'
  '28': 'before the ark of the Lord went on continually, and blew with the trumpets:
    and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the
    Lord, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. &l14&rAnd the second
    day they compassed'
  '29': 'the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days. &l15&rAnd
    it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of
    the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that
    day they compassed the'
  '30': city seven times. &l16&rAnd it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord hath given you the city. &l17&rAnd the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to
  '31': 'the Lord: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her
    in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. &l18&rAnd ye, in any
    wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed,
    when ye take of the'
  '32': 'accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. &l19&rBut
    all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto
    the Lord: they shall come into the treasury of the Lord. &l20&rSo the people shouted
    when the'
  '33': 'priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard
    the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the
    wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight
    before him, and they'
  '34': took the city. &l21&rAnd they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword. &l22&rBut Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the
  '35': harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her. &l23&rAnd the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought
  '36': 'out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. &l24&rAnd
    they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and
    the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of
    the house of the Lord.'
  '37': '&l25&rAnd Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father''s household,
    and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she
    hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. &l26&rAnd Joshua adjured
    them at that'
  '38': 'time, saying, Cursed be the man before the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth
    this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in
    his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it. &l27&rSo the Lord was with Joshua;
    and his fame'
  '39': was noised throughout all the country.
  '40': 'Chapter 7

    But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan,
    the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took
    of the accursed thing: and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children'
  '41': of Israel. &l2&rAnd Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai. &l3&rAnd they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let
  '42': 'not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and
    smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.
    &l4&rSo there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they
    fled before the men of'
  '43': 'Ai. &l5&rAnd the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they
    chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going
    down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. &l6&rAnd
    Joshua rent his'
  '44': clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the Lord until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads. &l7&rAnd Joshua said, Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to
  '45': deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan! &l8&rO Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies! &l9&rFor the Canaanites and all the
  '46': 'inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and
    cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name? &l10&rAnd
    the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?
    &l11&rIsrael'
  '47': 'hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded
    them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and

  '2': 'family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: &l18&rAnd he brought
    his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son
    of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. &l19&rAnd Joshua said unto Achan,
    My son, give, I pray'
  '3': 'thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell
    me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me. &l20&rAnd Achan answered Joshua,
    and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus
    have I done:'
  '4': '&l21&rWhen I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred
    shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted
    them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my
    tent, and the'
  '5': silver under it. &l22&rSo Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. &l23&rAnd they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of
  '6': Israel, and laid them out before the Lord. &l24&rAnd Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his
  '7': 'tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.
    &l25&rAnd Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the Lord shall trouble thee
    this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after
    they had stoned them'
  '8': with stones. &l26&rAnd they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.
  '9': 'Chapter 8

    And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the
    people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand
    the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land: &l2&rAnd thou shalt
    do to'
  '10': 'Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof,
    and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an
    ambush for the city behind it. &l3&rSo Joshua arose, and all the people of war,
    to go up against'
  '11': 'Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them
    away by night. &l4&rAnd he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
    against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be
    ye all ready:'
  '12': '&l5&rAnd I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city:
    and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that
    we will flee before them, &l6&r(For they will come out after us) till we have
    drawn them from the'
  '13': 'city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore
    we will flee before them. &l7&rThen ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize
    upon the city: for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand. &l8&rAnd
    it shall be, when ye have'
  '14': 'taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment
    of the Lord shall ye do. See, I have commanded you. &l9&rJoshua therefore sent
    them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on
    the west side of'
  '15': 'Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people. &l10&rAnd Joshua rose
    up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders
    of Israel, before the people to Ai. &l11&rAnd all the people, even the people
    of war that were with'
  '16': 'him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the
    north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai. &l12&rAnd he took
    about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai,
    on the west side of the'
  '17': city. &l13&rAnd when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. &l14&rAnd it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it,
  '18': that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city. &l15&rAnd Joshua and
  '19': 'all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of
    the wilderness. &l16&rAnd all the people that were in Ai were called together
    to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from
    the city. &l17&rAnd there'
  '20': 'was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they
    left the city open, and pursued after Israel. &l18&rAnd the Lord said unto Joshua,
    Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine
    hand. And'
  '21': 'Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city. &l19&rAnd
    the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched
    out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set
    the city'
  '22': 'on fire. &l20&rAnd when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and,
    behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to
    flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back
    upon the pursuers.'
  '23': '&l21&rAnd when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city,
    and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the
    men of Ai. &l22&rAnd the other issued out of the city against them; so they were
    in the midst of'
  '24': 'Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so
    that they let none of them remain or escape. &l23&rAnd the king of Ai they took
    alive, and brought him to Joshua. &l24&rAnd it came to pass, when Israel had made
    an end of slaying'
  '25': all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
  '26': '&l25&rAnd so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women,
    were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. &l26&rFor Joshua drew not his hand
    back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all
    the inhabitants of Ai.'
  '27': '&l27&rOnly the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto
    themselves, according unto the word of the Lord which he commanded Joshua. &l28&rAnd
    Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.
    &l29&rAnd the'
  '28': 'king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was
    down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and
    cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap
    of stones, that'
  '29': remaineth unto this day. &l30&rThen Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in mount Ebal, &l31&rAs Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over
  '30': 'which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings
    unto the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings. &l32&rAnd he wrote there upon the
    stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children
    of Israel.'
  '31': '&l33&rAnd all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood
    on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare
    the ark of the covenant of the Lord, as well the stranger, as he that was born
    among them; half'
  '32': of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel. &l34&rAnd afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and
  '33': cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law. &l35&rThere was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.
  '34': 'Chapter 9

    And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the
    hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against
    Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite,
    and the'
  '35': Jebusite, heard thereof; &l2&rThat they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord. &l3&rAnd when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai, &l4&rThey did work wilily, and went and
  '36': made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; &l5&rAnd old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.
  '37': '&l6&rAnd they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him,
    and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye
    a league with us. &l7&rAnd the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure
    ye dwell among us; and'
  '38': how shall we make a league with you? &l8&rAnd they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye? &l9&rAnd they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the
  '39': 'Lord thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
    &l10&rAnd all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan,
    to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth. &l11&rWherefore'
  '40': 'our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take
    victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We
    are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us. &l12&rThis our bread
    we took hot for our'
  '41': 'provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but
    now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy: &l13&rAnd these bottles of wine, which
    we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our
    shoes are become old by'
  '42': 'reason of the very long journey. &l14&rAnd the men took of their victuals,
    and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord. &l15&rAnd Joshua made peace with
    them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation
    sware unto'
  '43': them. &l16&rAnd it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them. &l17&rAnd the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the
  '44': third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim. &l18&rAnd the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel. And all the congregation
  '45': 'murmured against the princes. &l19&rBut all the princes said unto all the
    congregation, We have sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel: now therefore
    we may not touch them. &l20&rThis we will do to them; we will even let them live,
    lest wrath be upon'
  '46': us, because of the oath which we sware unto them. &l21&rAnd the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them. &l22&rAnd Joshua called for them, and he
  '47': spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us? &l23&rNow therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the
  '48': house of my God. &l24&rAnd they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the Lord thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore
  '49': 'we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
    &l25&rAnd now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto
    thee to do unto us, do. &l26&rAnd so did he unto them, and delivered them out
    of the hand of the'
  '50': children of Israel, that they slew them not. &l27&rAnd Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

    Chapter 10

    Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had
    taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king,
    so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon'
  '2': had made peace with Israel, and were among them; &l2&rThat they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty. &l3&rWherefore Adonizedec king of
  '3': 'Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth,
    and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, &l4&rCome
    up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with
    Joshua and with the'
  '4': children of Israel. &l5&rTherefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped
  '5': 'before Gibeon, and made war against it. &l6&rAnd the men of Gibeon sent unto
    Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come
    up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites
    that dwell in the'
  '6': 'mountains are gathered together against us. &l7&rSo Joshua ascended from Gilgal,
    he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour. &l8&rAnd
    the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine
    hand; there'
  '7': shall not a man of them stand before thee. &l9&rJoshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night. &l10&rAnd the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way
  '8': that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah. &l11&rAnd it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they
  '9': 'died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children
    of Israel slew with the sword. &l12&rThen spake Joshua to the Lord in the day
    when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he
    said in the sight of'
  '10': Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. &l13&rAnd the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood
  '11': 'still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
    &l14&rAnd there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened
    unto the voice of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel. &l15&rAnd Joshua returned,
    and all'
  '12': Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. &l16&rBut these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah. &l17&rAnd it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah. &l18&rAnd Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the
  '13': 'mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them: &l19&rAnd stay ye
    not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them
    not to enter into their cities: for the Lord your God hath delivered them into
    your hand. &l20&rAnd it'
  '14': came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities. &l21&rAnd all the people returned to the camp to
  '15': 'Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children
    of Israel. &l22&rThen said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those
    five kings unto me out of the cave. &l23&rAnd they did so, and brought forth those
    five kings'
  '16': unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. &l24&rAnd it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel,
  '17': and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them. &l25&rAnd Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong
  '18': 'and of good courage: for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against
    whom ye fight. &l26&rAnd afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged
    them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening. &l27&rAnd
    it came to'
  '19': pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day. &l28&rAnd that
  '20': 'day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the
    king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein;
    he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king
    of Jericho. &l29&rThen'
  '21': 'Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought
    against Libnah: &l30&rAnd the Lord delivered it also, and the king thereof, into
    the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls
    that were'
  '22': 'therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did
    unto the king of Jericho. &l31&rAnd Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel
    with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: &l32&rAnd
    the Lord delivered'
  '23': Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah. &l33&rThen Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
  '24': 'smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining. &l34&rAnd
    from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped
    against it, and fought against it: &l35&rAnd they took it on that day, and smote
    it with the edge of'
  '25': 'the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that
    day, according to all that he had done to Lachish. &l36&rAnd Joshua went up from
    Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it: &l37&rAnd
    they took it, and'
  '26': smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.
  '27': '&l38&rAnd Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought
    against it: &l39&rAnd he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof;
    and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the
    souls that were'
  '28': 'therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir,
    and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king. &l40&rSo
    Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale,
    and of the'
  '29': 'springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed
    all that breathed, as the Lord God of Israel commanded. &l41&rAnd Joshua smote
    them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto
    Gibeon. &l42&rAnd all'
  '30': these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel. &l43&rAnd Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
  '31': 'Chapter 11

    And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he
    sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
    &l2&rAnd to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains'
  '32': south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, &l3&rAnd to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon
  '33': in the land of Mizpeh. &l4&rAnd they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. &l5&rAnd when all these kings were met together, they came and
  '34': 'pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel. &l6&rAnd
    the Lord said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about
    this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their
    horses, and burn their'
  '35': chariots with fire. &l7&rSo Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them. &l8&rAnd the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon,
  '36': 'and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they
    smote them, until they left them none remaining. &l9&rAnd Joshua did unto them
    as the Lord bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
    &l10&rAnd Joshua at'
  '37': 'that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the
    sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms. &l11&rAnd they
    smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying
    them: there was'
  '38': 'not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire. &l12&rAnd all the
    cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them
    with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant
    of the Lord'
  '39': commanded. &l13&rBut as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn. &l14&rAnd all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves;
  '40': but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe. &l15&rAs the Lord commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the Lord
  '41': commanded Moses. &l16&rSo Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same; &l17&rEven from the mount Halak, that goeth up to
  '42': 'Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and
    all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them. &l18&rJoshua made war
    a long time with all those kings. &l19&rThere was not a city that made peace with
    the children of Israel,'
  '43': 'save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.
    &l20&rFor it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against
    Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have
    no favour, but that'
  '44': 'he might destroy them, as the Lord commanded Moses. &l21&rAnd at that time
    came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir,
    from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of
    Israel: Joshua'
  '45': 'destroyed them utterly with their cities. &l22&rThere was none of the Anakims
    left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod,
    there remained. &l23&rSo Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the
    Lord said unto'
  '46': Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

  '21': their families, the cities and the villages thereof. &l24&rAnd Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad according to their families. &l25&rAnd their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the

  '24': 'inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession
    of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families. &l30&rAnd their

    in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength

    blessed him, and gave'
  '37': unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance. &l14&rHebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. &l15&rAnd the name of Hebron before
  '38': was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

    to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he
    was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. &l2&rThere was also a lot'

  '24': commandment of the Lord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father. &l5&rAnd there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan; &l6&rBecause the daughters of Manasseh had an
  '25': 'inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh''s sons had the land
    of Gilead. &l7&rAnd the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth

    of it were at the sea: &l10&rSouthward it was Ephraim''s, and northward it was
    Manasseh''s, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the
    north, and in Issachar'

  '29': inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries. &l12&rYet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. &l13&rYet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were
  '30': waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out. &l14&rAnd the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as
  '31': the Lord hath blessed me hitherto? &l15&rAnd Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.
  '32': '&l16&rAnd the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and
    all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron,
    both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of
    Jezreel. &l17&rAnd'
  '33': 'Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying,
    Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:
    &l18&rBut the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it

    And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh,
    and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued
    before them. &l2&rAnd there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,'

  '41': 'described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua

    hand of Moses: &l3&rThat the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly

  '27': 'flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood. &l4&rAnd
    when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of
    the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of
    that city, they'
  '28': shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. &l5&rAnd if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated
  '29': 'him not beforetime. &l6&rAnd he shall dwell in that city, until he stand
    before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that
    shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city,
    and unto his own'
  '30': house, unto the city from whence he fled. &l7&rAnd they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah. &l8&rAnd on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they
  '31': assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. &l9&rThese were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the

  '35': 'their suburbs. &l4&rAnd the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites:

    which remained of'

    Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
    &l2&rAnd said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded
    you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you: &l3&rYe have'
  '8': 'not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge

  '10': 'and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave
    unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. &l6&rSo
    Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents. &l7&rNow
    to the one half of the'
  '11': 'tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other
    half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And
    when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them, &l8&rAnd
    he spake unto them,'
  '12': 'saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle,
    with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much
    raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. &l9&rAnd the children
    of Reuben and the'
  '13': children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to
  '14': the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses. &l10&rAnd when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to
  '15': see to. &l11&rAnd the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of
  '16': Israel. &l12&rAnd when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them. &l13&rAnd the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the
  '17': children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, &l14&rAnd with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of
  '18': their fathers among the thousands of Israel. &l15&rAnd they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying, &l16&rThus saith the whole congregation
  '19': of the Lord, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the Lord, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the Lord? &l17&rIs the iniquity of Peor too
  '20': little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord, &l18&rBut that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the Lord, that to
  '21': morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. &l19&rNotwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the Lord, wherein the Lord's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession
  '22': 'among us: but rebel not against the Lord, nor rebel against us, in building
    you an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God. &l20&rDid not Achan the son
    of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation
    of Israel?'
  '23': and that man perished not alone in his iniquity. &l21&rThen the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel, &l22&rThe Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, he
  '24': knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the Lord, (save us not this day,) &l23&rThat we have built us an altar to turn from following the Lord, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if
  '25': to offer peace offerings thereon, let the Lord himself require it; &l24&rAnd if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel?
  '26': '&l25&rFor the Lord hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children
    of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the Lord: so shall your children
    make our children cease from fearing the Lord. &l26&rTherefore we said, Let us
    now prepare to'
  '27': 'build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice: &l27&rBut that
    it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we
    might do the service of the Lord before him with our burnt offerings, and with
    our sacrifices, and'
  '28': with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the Lord. &l28&rTherefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again,
  '29': Behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you. &l29&rGod forbid that we should rebel against the Lord, and turn this day from following the Lord, to
  '30': build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the Lord our God that is before his tabernacle. &l30&rAnd when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel
  '31': which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them. &l31&rAnd Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and
  '32': 'to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the Lord is among
    us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the Lord: now ye have
    delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord. &l32&rAnd Phinehas
    the son of Eleazar the'
  '33': priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again. &l33&rAnd the thing pleased the children of Israel; and
  '34': 'the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them
    in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt. &l34&rAnd
    the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall
    be a'

    the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls,
    that not one thing'
  '45': hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof. &l15&rTherefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the Lord your God
  '46': promised you; so shall the Lord bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you. &l16&rWhen ye have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and have
  '47': gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.
  '48': 'Chapter 24

    And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders
    of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers;
    and they presented themselves before God. &l2&rAnd Joshua said unto all the people,'
  '49': 'Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of
    the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor:
    and they served other gods. &l3&rAnd I took your father Abraham from the other
    side of the flood,'
  '50': 'and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and
    gave him Isaac. &l4&rAnd I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau
    mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.'

  '1': 'Chapter 24 Cont.

    &l5&rI sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which
    I did among them: and afterward I brought you out. &l6&rAnd I brought your fathers
    out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your'
  '2': 'fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea. &l7&rAnd when they cried
    unto the Lord, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the
    sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt:
    and ye dwelt in'
  '3': 'the wilderness a long season. &l8&rAnd I brought you into the land of the
    Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and
    I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed
    them from before you.'
  '4': '&l9&rThen Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against
    Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you: &l10&rBut I would
    not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out
    of his hand.'
  '5': '&l11&rAnd you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho
    fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and
    the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered
    them into your'
  '6': hand. &l12&rAnd I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. &l13&rAnd I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not,
  '7': 'and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not
    do ye eat. &l14&rNow therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in
    truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the
    flood, and in Egypt;'
  '8': 'and serve ye the Lord. &l15&rAnd if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord,
    choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served
    that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose
    land ye dwell:'
  '9': but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. &l16&rAnd the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the Lord, to serve other gods; &l17&rFor the Lord our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt,
  '10': 'from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight,
    and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through
    whom we passed: &l18&rAnd the Lord drave out from before us all the people, even
    the Amorites which'
  '11': 'dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the Lord; for he is our God.
    &l19&rAnd Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the Lord: for he is an
    holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your
    sins. &l20&rIf ye'
  '12': forsake the Lord, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good. &l21&rAnd the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the Lord. &l22&rAnd Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses
  '13': against yourselves that ye have chosen you the Lord, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses. &l23&rNow therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel. &l24&rAnd the people said
  '14': unto Joshua, The Lord our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey. &l25&rSo Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. &l26&rAnd Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and
  '15': 'took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary
    of the Lord. &l27&rAnd Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall
    be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which he spake
    unto us: it'
  '16': shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God. &l28&rSo Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance. &l29&rAnd it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred
  '17': and ten years old. &l30&rAnd they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash. &l31&rAnd Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that
  '18': overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the Lord, that he had done for Israel. &l32&rAnd the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons
  '19': 'of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became
    the inheritance of the children of Joseph. &l33&rAnd Eleazar the son of Aaron
    died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which
    was given him in mount'
  '20': Ephraim.
