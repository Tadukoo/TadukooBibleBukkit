  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified
    by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called: &l2&rMercy unto
    you, and peace, and love, be multiplied. &l3&rBeloved, when I gave all diligence
    to'
  '2': write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. &l4&rFor there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of
  '3': old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. &l5&rI will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having
  '4': saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. &l6&rAnd the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the
  '5': great day. &l7&rEven as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. &l8&rLikewise also these
  '6': filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. &l9&rYet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke
  '7': 'thee. &l10&rBut these speak evil of those things which they know not: but
    what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
    &l11&rWoe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after
    the error of'
  '8': 'Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core. &l12&rThese are
    spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves
    without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose
    fruit withereth,'
  '9': without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; &l13&rRaging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. &l14&rAnd Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
  '10': saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, &l15&rTo execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly
  '11': sinners have spoken against him. &l16&rThese are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage. &l17&rBut, beloved, remember ye the words which
  '12': were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; &l18&rHow that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. &l19&rThese be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.
  '13': '&l20&rBut ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying
    in the Holy Ghost, &l21&rKeep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy
    of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. &l22&rAnd of some have compassion,
    making a'
  '14': 'difference: &l23&rAnd others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire;
    hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. &l24&rNow unto him that is able
    to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of
    his glory with exceeding'
  '15': joy, &l25&rTo the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
