  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked
    the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight
    against them? &l2&rAnd the Lord said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered
    the'
  '2': land into his hand. &l3&rAnd Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him. &l4&rAnd Judah went up; and the Lord delivered
  '3': 'the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in
    Bezek ten thousand men. &l5&rAnd they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought
    against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites. &l6&rBut Adonibezek
    fled; and they'
  '4': 'pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
    &l7&rAnd Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their
    great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God
    hath requited me.'
  '5': And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died. &l8&rNow the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire. &l9&rAnd afterward the children of Judah went down to
  '6': 'fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south,
    and in the valley. &l10&rAnd Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
    (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman,
    and Talmai.'
  '7': ' &l11&rAnd from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name
    of Debir before was Kirjathsepher: &l12&rAnd Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher,
    and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. &l13&rAnd Othniel
    the son of'
  '8': 'Kenaz, Caleb''s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter
    to wife. &l14&rAnd it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to
    ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto
    her, What wilt'
  '9': 'thou? &l15&rAnd she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given
    me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs
    and the nether springs. &l16&rAnd the children of the Kenite, Moses'' father in
    law, went up out'
  '10': of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people. &l17&rAnd Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited
  '11': Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah. &l18&rAlso Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof. &l19&rAnd the Lord was with Judah; and he drave out the
  '12': 'inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the
    valley, because they had chariots of iron. &l20&rAnd they gave Hebron unto Caleb,
    as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak. &l21&rAnd the children
    of Benjamin'
  '13': 'did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites
    dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day. &l22&rAnd the
    house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the Lord was with them.
    &l23&rAnd the house of'
  '14': Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.) &l24&rAnd the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy. &l25&rAnd when he
  '15': 'shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge
    of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family. &l26&rAnd the man went
    into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz:
    which is the name'
  '16': thereof unto this day. &l27&rNeither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her
  '17': 'towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. &l28&rAnd it came to
    pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did
    not utterly drive them out. &l29&rNeither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites
    that dwelt in Gezer; but'
  '18': the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them. &l30&rNeither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries. &l31&rNeither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of
  '19': 'Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of
    Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob: &l32&rBut the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites,
    the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out. &l33&rNeither did
    Naphtali drive'
  '20': 'out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but
    he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants
    of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them. &l34&rAnd the Amorites
    forced'
  '21': 'the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to
    come down to the valley: &l35&rBut the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in
    Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that
    they became tributaries.'
  '22': ' &l36&rAnd the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from
    the rock, and upward.'
  '23': 'Chapter 2

    And an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to
    go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your
    fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you. &l2&rAnd ye shall
    make no'
  '24': 'league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars:
    but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this? &l3&rWherefore I also
    said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in
    your sides, and their'
  '25': 'gods shall be a snare unto you. &l4&rAnd it came to pass, when the angel
    of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people
    lifted up their voice, and wept. &l5&rAnd they called the name of that place Bochim:
    and they sacrificed'
  '26': there unto the Lord. &l6&rAnd when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. &l7&rAnd the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived
  '27': Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the Lord, that he did for Israel. &l8&rAnd Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old. &l9&rAnd they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in
  '28': 'the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash. &l10&rAnd also
    all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another
    generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had
    done for Israel.'
  '29': '&l11&rAnd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served
    Baalim: &l12&rAnd they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them
    out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that
    were round'
  '30': about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the Lord to anger. &l13&rAnd they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. &l14&rAnd the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that
  '31': spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. &l15&rWhithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had said, and as the
  '32': 'Lord had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed. &l16&rNevertheless
    the Lord raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that
    spoiled them. &l17&rAnd yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they
    went a whoring after'
  '33': 'other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the
    way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the Lord; but they
    did not so. &l18&rAnd when the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with
    the judge, and'
  '34': 'delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge:
    for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed
    them and vexed them. &l19&rAnd it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that
    they returned, and'
  '35': corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way. &l20&rAnd the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and he said, Because
  '36': 'that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers,
    and have not hearkened unto my voice; &l21&rI also will not henceforth drive out
    any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died: &l22&rThat
    through them I'
  '37': may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not. &l23&rTherefore the Lord left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
  '38': 'Chapter 3

    Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by them, even as
    many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan; &l2&rOnly that the generations
    of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as'
  '39': before knew nothing thereof; &l3&rNamely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath. &l4&rAnd they were to prove Israel by
  '40': them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. &l5&rAnd the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and
  '41': 'Jebusites: &l6&rAnd they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
    their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. &l7&rAnd the children of
    Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and forgat the Lord their God, and served
    Baalim and the'
  '42': 'groves. &l8&rTherefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and
    he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children
    of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years. &l9&rAnd when the children of
    Israel cried unto'
  '43': 'the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered
    them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb''s younger brother. &l10&rAnd the Spirit
    of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the
    Lord'
  '44': delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim. &l11&rAnd the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. &l12&rAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
  '45': 'Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because
    they had done evil in the sight of the Lord. &l13&rAnd he gathered unto him the
    children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city
    of palm trees.'
  '46': '&l14&rSo the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
    &l15&rBut when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised them
    up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him
    the children of'
  '47': 'Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab. &l16&rBut Ehud made him
    a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his
    raiment upon his right thigh. &l17&rAnd he brought the present unto Eglon king
    of Moab: and Eglon was a'
  '48': 'very fat man. &l18&rAnd when he had made an end to offer the present, he
    sent away the people that bare the present. &l19&rBut he himself turned again
    from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee,
    O king: who said, Keep'
  '49': silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. &l20&rAnd Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. &l21&rAnd Ehud put
  '50': 'forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust
    it into his belly: &l22&rAnd the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat
    closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly;
    and the dirt came out.'

    &l23&rThen Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour
    upon him, and locked them. &l24&rWhen he was gone out, his servants came; and
    when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said,'
  '2': 'Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. &l25&rAnd they tarried
    till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore
    they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead
    on the earth.'
  '3': '&l26&rAnd Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries,
    and escaped unto Seirath. &l27&rAnd it came to pass, when he was come, that he
    blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down
    with him from the'
  '4': 'mount, and he before them. &l28&rAnd he said unto them, Follow after me: for
    the Lord hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went
    down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man
    to pass over.'
  '5': '&l29&rAnd they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty,
    and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man. &l30&rSo Moab was subdued
    that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years. &l31&rAnd
    after him was'
  '6': 'Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with
    an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.'
  '7': 'Chapter 4

    And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, when Ehud
    was dead. &l2&rAnd the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that
    reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth
    of'
  '8': 'the Gentiles. &l3&rAnd the children of Israel cried unto the Lord: for he
    had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the
    children of Israel. &l4&rAnd Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she
    judged Israel at that'
  '9': 'time. &l5&rAnd she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
    Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
    &l6&rAnd she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and
    said unto him, Hath'
  '10': not the Lord God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? &l7&rAnd I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's
  '11': 'army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine
    hand. &l8&rAnd Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but
    if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go. &l9&rAnd she said, I will surely
    go with thee:'
  '12': notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. &l10&rAnd Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up
  '13': 'with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him. &l11&rNow
    Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses,
    had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim,
    which is by'
  '14': Kedesh. &l12&rAnd they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor. &l13&rAnd Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles
  '15': 'unto the river of Kishon. &l14&rAnd Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this
    is the day in which the Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the
    Lord gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand
    men after him.'
  '16': '&l15&rAnd the Lord discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his
    host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off
    his chariot, and fled away on his feet. &l16&rBut Barak pursued after the chariots,
    and after the host,'
  '17': 'unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the
    edge of the sword; and there was not a man left. &l17&rHowbeit Sisera fled away
    on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace
    between Jabin the'
  '18': king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. &l18&rAnd Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle. &l19&rAnd he said unto
  '19': her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. &l20&rAgain he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of
  '20': 'thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No. &l21&rThen
    Jael Heber''s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and
    went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into
    the ground: for he was'
  '21': fast asleep and weary. So he died. &l22&rAnd, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in
  '22': his temples. &l23&rSo God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. &l24&rAnd the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
  '23': 'Chapter 5

    Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying, &l2&rPraise
    ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.
    &l3&rHear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the'
  '24': Lord; I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel. &l4&rLord, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water. &l5&rThe mountains melted from before
  '25': the Lord, even that Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel. &l6&rIn the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways. &l7&rThe inhabitants of the villages ceased, they
  '26': 'ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
    &l8&rThey chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear
    seen among forty thousand in Israel? &l9&rMy heart is toward the governors of
    Israel, that'
  '27': offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the Lord. &l10&rSpeak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way. &l11&rThey that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall
  '28': 'they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord, even the righteous acts toward
    the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the Lord go
    down to the gates. &l12&rAwake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise,
    Barak, and lead'
  '29': 'thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. &l13&rThen he made him that remaineth
    have dominion over the nobles among the people: the Lord made me have dominion
    over the mighty. &l14&rOut of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek;
    after thee,'
  '30': 'Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of
    Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer. &l15&rAnd the princes of Issachar
    were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the
    valley. For the'
  '31': 'divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart. &l16&rWhy abodest
    thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions
    of Reuben there were great searchings of heart. &l17&rGilead abode beyond Jordan:
    and why did Dan'
  '32': remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches. &l18&rZebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field. &l19&rThe kings came and fought, then fought the kings of
  '33': Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money. &l20&rThey fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. &l21&rThe river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast
  '34': trodden down strength. &l22&rThen were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones. &l23&rCurse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help
  '35': of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty. &l24&rBlessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent. &l25&rHe asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly
  '36': 'dish. &l26&rShe put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen''s
    hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she
    had pierced and stricken through his temples. &l27&rAt her feet he bowed, he fell,
    he lay down: at'
  '37': 'her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead. &l28&rThe
    mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is
    his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots? &l29&rHer
    wise ladies'
  '38': answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself, &l30&rHave they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both
  '39': 'sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil? &l31&rSo let all thine
    enemies perish, O Lord: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth
    forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.'
  '40': 'Chapter 6

    And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord delivered
    them into the hand of Midian seven years. &l2&rAnd the hand of Midian prevailed
    against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them'
  '41': the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds. &l3&rAnd so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them; &l4&rAnd they encamped against them,
  '42': and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. &l5&rFor they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and
  '43': 'their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy
    it. &l6&rAnd Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the
    children of Israel cried unto the Lord. &l7&rAnd it came to pass, when the children
    of Israel cried'
  '44': unto the Lord because of the Midianites, &l8&rThat the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; &l9&rAnd I
  '45': delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land; &l10&rAnd I said unto you, I am the Lord your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land
  '46': 'ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice. &l11&rAnd there came an angel
    of the Lord, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash
    the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it
    from the Midianites.'
  '47': '&l12&rAnd the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, The
    Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. &l13&rAnd Gideon said unto him,
    Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where
    be all his miracles'
  '48': which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? but now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. &l14&rAnd the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save
  '49': 'Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee? &l15&rAnd he
    said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is
    poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father''s house. &l16&rAnd the Lord
    said unto him, Surely I'
  '50': will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. &l17&rAnd he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

    &l18&rDepart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my
    present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.
    &l19&rAnd Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an'
  '2': 'ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot,
    and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it. &l20&rAnd the angel
    of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon
    this rock, and'
  '3': pour out the broth. And he did so. &l21&rThen the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened
  '4': cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight. &l22&rAnd when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God! for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face. &l23&rAnd the Lord said unto him, Peace
  '5': 'be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die. &l24&rThen Gideon built an altar
    there unto the Lord, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah
    of the Abiezrites. &l25&rAnd it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said
    unto him, Take'
  '6': 'thy father''s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and
    throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that
    is by it: &l26&rAnd build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this
    rock, in the ordered'
  '7': 'place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood
    of the grove which thou shalt cut down. &l27&rThen Gideon took ten men of his
    servants, and did as the Lord had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared
    his father''s'
  '8': household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night. &l28&rAnd when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second
  '9': bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. &l29&rAnd they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. &l30&rThen the men of the city said unto Joash,
  '10': 'Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of
    Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it. &l31&rAnd Joash said
    unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he
    that will plead for'
  '11': 'him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let
    him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar. &l32&rTherefore on
    that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because
    he hath thrown down his'
  '12': altar. &l33&rThen all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel. &l34&rBut the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was
  '13': 'gathered after him. &l35&rAnd he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh;
    who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun,
    and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. &l36&rAnd Gideon said unto God,
    If thou wilt'
  '14': save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, &l37&rBehold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast
  '15': 'said. &l38&rAnd it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust
    the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
    &l39&rAnd Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will
    speak but this'
  '16': 'once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now
    be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. &l40&rAnd
    God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew
    on all the ground.'
  '17': 'Chapter 7

    Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up
    early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites
    were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley. &l2&rAnd
    the Lord'
  '18': said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me. &l3&rNow therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,
  '19': Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand. &l4&rAnd the Lord said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down
  '20': 'unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that
    of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee;
    and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall
    not go. &l5&rSo he'
  '21': 'brought down the people unto the water: and the Lord said unto Gideon, Every
    one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou
    set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink. &l6&rAnd
    the number of'
  '22': 'them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men:
    but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. &l7&rAnd
    the Lord said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you,
    and deliver'
  '23': 'the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man
    unto his place. &l8&rSo the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets:
    and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those
    three hundred men:'
  '24': and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley. &l9&rAnd it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand. &l10&rBut if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah
  '25': 'thy servant down to the host: &l11&rAnd thou shalt hear what they say; and
    afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went
    he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in
    the host. &l12&rAnd'
  '26': the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude. &l13&rAnd when Gideon was come, behold, there was a
  '27': man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along. &l14&rAnd his fellow
  '28': 'answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son
    of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all
    the host. &l15&rAnd it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and
    the interpretation'
  '29': thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian. &l16&rAnd he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand,
  '30': 'with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers. &l17&rAnd he said unto
    them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of
    the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do. &l18&rWhen I blow with a
    trumpet, I and all that'
  '31': are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon. &l19&rSo Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and
  '32': 'they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the
    pitchers that were in their hands. &l20&rAnd the three companies blew the trumpets,
    and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets
    in their right'
  '33': 'hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon.
    &l21&rAnd they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the
    host ran, and cried, and fled. &l22&rAnd the three hundred blew the trumpets,
    and the Lord set every'
  '34': 'man''s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host
    fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.
    &l23&rAnd the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and
    out of Asher, and out'
  '35': of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites. &l24&rAnd Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered
  '36': themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. &l25&rAnd they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the
  '37': heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.
  '38': 'Chapter 8

    And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou
    calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did
    chide with him sharply. &l2&rAnd he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison
    of'
  '39': 'you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage
    of Abiezer? &l3&rGod hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb
    and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was
    abated toward him, when'
  '40': he had said that. &l4&rAnd Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them. &l5&rAnd he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for
  '41': they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian. &l6&rAnd the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army? &l7&rAnd Gideon said, Therefore when the
  '42': 'Lord hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your
    flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers. &l8&rAnd he went up thence
    to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as
    the men of'
  '43': Succoth had answered him. &l9&rAnd he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower. &l10&rNow Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were
  '44': 'left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred
    and twenty thousand men that drew sword. &l11&rAnd Gideon went up by the way of
    them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host;
    for the host was'
  '45': secure. &l12&rAnd when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host. &l13&rAnd Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up, &l14&rAnd caught a
  '46': 'young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto
    him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen
    men. &l15&rAnd he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna,
    with whom ye'
  '47': did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary? &l16&rAnd he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of
  '48': Succoth. &l17&rAnd he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city. &l18&rThen said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children
  '49': 'of a king. &l19&rAnd he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my
    mother: as the Lord liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
    &l20&rAnd he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth
    drew not his sword: for he'
  '50': 'feared, because he was yet a youth. &l21&rThen Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise
    thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose,
    and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels''
    necks.'

    &l22&rThen the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and
    thy son, and thy son''s son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of
    Midian. &l23&rAnd Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall'

    &l25&rAnd they'
  '3': answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey. &l26&rAnd the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and
  '4': 'collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the
    chains that were about their camels'' necks. &l27&rAnd Gideon made an ephod thereof,
    and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring
    after it: which'

    ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives. &l31&rAnd his concubine

    &l32&rAnd Gideon the son'
  '7': of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. &l33&rAnd it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made
  '8': 'Baalberith their god. &l34&rAnd the children of Israel remembered not the

  '10': 'Chapter 9

    And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother''s brethren,
    and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother''s

    Whether is'
  '11': better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh. &l3&rAnd his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the
  '12': 'men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech;
    for they said, He is our brother. &l4&rAnd they gave him threescore and ten pieces
    of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light
    persons,'
  '13': 'which followed him. &l5&rAnd he went unto his father''s house at Ophrah,
    and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons,
    upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left;
    for he hid himself.'
  '14': '&l6&rAnd all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo,
    and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.
    &l7&rAnd when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim,
    and'
  '15': lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you. &l8&rThe trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. &l9&rBut the olive
  '16': tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? &l10&rAnd the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us. &l11&rBut the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake
  '17': my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees? &l12&rThen said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us. &l13&rAnd the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over
  '18': 'the trees? &l14&rThen said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and
    reign over us. &l15&rAnd the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint

    away, and fled, and'
  '23': went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother. &l22&rWhen Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel, &l23&rThen God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with
  '24': 'Abimelech: &l24&rThat the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of
    Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which
    slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his
    brethren. &l25&rAnd the'

    they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech. &l26&rAnd
    Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the
    men of Shechem'
  '26': put their confidence in him. &l27&rAnd they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech. &l28&rAnd Gaal the son of Ebed
  '27': 'said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is
    not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the
    father of Shechem: for why should we serve him? &l29&rAnd would to God this people
    were under my hand!'
  '28': then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out. &l30&rAnd when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. &l31&rAnd he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily,
  '29': 'saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem;
    and, behold, they fortify the city against thee. &l32&rNow therefore up by night,
    thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field: &l33&rAnd
    it shall be, that in'
  '30': 'the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon
    the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against
    thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion. &l34&rAnd Abimelech
    rose up, and all'
  '31': 'the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem
    in four companies. &l35&rAnd Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering
    of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with
    him, from lying'
  '32': in wait. &l36&rAnd when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men. &l37&rAnd Gaal spake again, and said, See
  '33': there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim. &l38&rThen said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people
  '34': that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them. &l39&rAnd Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. &l40&rAnd Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the
  '35': 'entering of the gate. &l41&rAnd Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust
    out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem. &l42&rAnd it
    came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they
    told Abimelech.'
  '36': '&l43&rAnd he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and
    laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out
    of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them. &l44&rAnd Abimelech,
    and the company that was'
  '37': 'with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city:
    and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and
    slew them. &l45&rAnd Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took
    the city, and'
  '38': slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt. &l46&rAnd when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith. &l47&rAnd it was told Abimelech, that all the men of
  '39': the tower of Shechem were gathered together. &l48&rAnd Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and
  '40': said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done. &l49&rAnd all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so
  '41': that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women. &l50&rThen went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it. &l51&rBut there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women,
  '42': and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower. &l52&rAnd Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. &l53&rAnd a certain woman cast a piece of
  '43': a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull. &l54&rThen he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through,
  '44': 'and he died. &l55&rAnd when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead,
    they departed every man unto his place. &l56&rThus God rendered the wickedness
    of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: &l57&rAnd
    all the evil of'

    of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim. &l2&rAnd
    he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir. &l3&rAnd'

  '48': died, and was buried in Camon. &l6&rAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the
  '49': gods of the Philistines, and forsook the Lord, and served not him. &l7&rAnd the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon. &l8&rAnd that year they vexed and

    distressed. &l10&rAnd the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying,'
  '2': We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim. &l11&rAnd the Lord said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the

    assembled'

  '7': 'Chapter 11

    Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an
    harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah. &l2&rAnd Gilead''s wife bare him sons; and
    his wife''s sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou
    shalt not'
  '8': 'inherit in our father''s house; for thou art the son of a strange woman. &l3&rThen
    Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were
    gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him. &l4&rAnd it came to pass
    in process of'
  '9': 'time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel. &l5&rAnd it was
    so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead
    went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob: &l6&rAnd they said unto Jephthah,
    Come, and be our'
  '10': captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon. &l7&rAnd Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress? &l8&rAnd the elders of Gilead said
  '11': unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. &l9&rAnd Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to
  '12': fight against the children of Ammon, and the Lord deliver them before me, shall I be your head? &l10&rAnd the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The Lord be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words. &l11&rThen Jephthah went with the
  '13': 'elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and
    Jephthah uttered all his words before the Lord in Mizpeh. &l12&rAnd Jephthah sent
    messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do
    with me, that thou'
  '14': 'art come against me to fight in my land? &l13&rAnd the king of the children
    of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my
    land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan:
    now therefore'
  '15': 'restore those lands again peaceably. &l14&rAnd Jephthah sent messengers again
    unto the king of the children of Ammon: &l15&rAnd said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah,
    Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
    &l16&rBut when'
  '16': 'Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red
    sea, and came to Kadesh; &l17&rThen Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom,
    saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would
    not hearken thereto.'
  '17': 'And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent:
    and Israel abode in Kadesh. &l18&rThen they went along through the wilderness,
    and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
    of the land of'
  '18': 'Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border
    of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab. &l19&rAnd Israel sent messengers unto
    Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let
    us pass, we pray'
  '19': 'thee, through thy land into my place. &l20&rBut Sihon trusted not Israel
    to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched
    in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. &l21&rAnd the Lord God of Israel delivered
    Sihon and all his'
  '20': 'people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed
    all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. &l22&rAnd they
    possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from
    the wilderness even unto'
  '21': Jordan. &l23&rSo now the Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it? &l24&rWilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the Lord our God shall
  '22': drive out from before us, them will we possess. &l25&rAnd now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them, &l26&rWhile Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and
  '23': 'in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts
    of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that
    time? &l27&rWherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong
    to war against me: the'
  '24': Lord the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon. &l28&rHowbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him. &l29&rThen the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and
  '25': he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon. &l30&rAnd Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon
  '26': into mine hands, &l31&rThen it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. &l32&rSo Jephthah passed
  '27': over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hands. &l33&rAnd he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter.
  '28': 'Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. &l34&rAnd
    Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to
    meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her
    he had neither son'
  '29': 'nor daughter. &l35&rAnd it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his
    clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou
    art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and
    I cannot go back.'
  '30': '&l36&rAnd she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto
    the Lord, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch
    as the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children
    of Ammon.'
  '31': '&l37&rAnd she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me
    alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my
    virginity, I and my fellows. &l38&rAnd he said, Go. And he sent her away for two
    months: and she went'
  '32': 'with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. &l39&rAnd
    it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who
    did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And
    it was a custom in'
  '33': Israel, &l40&rThat the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
  '34': 'Chapter 12

    And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said
    unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon,
    and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with'
  '35': fire. &l2&rAnd Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands. &l3&rAnd when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over
  '36': 'against the children of Ammon, and the Lord delivered them into my hand:
    wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me? &l4&rThen
    Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and
    the men of Gilead smote'
  '37': 'Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among
    the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites. &l5&rAnd the Gileadites took the passages
    of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which
    were escaped'
  '38': 'said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite?
    If he said, Nay; &l6&rThen said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said
    Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and
    slew him at'
  '39': 'the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty
    and two thousand. &l7&rAnd Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah
    the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. &l8&rAnd after him
    Ibzan of Bethlehem'
  '40': judged Israel. &l9&rAnd he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. &l10&rThen died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem. &l11&rAnd after him Elon, a
  '41': Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. &l12&rAnd Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun. &l13&rAnd after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel. &l14&rAnd he had forty sons and
  '42': 'thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged
    Israel eight years. &l15&rAnd Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and

    And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord
    delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. &l2&rAnd there was
    a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and
    his'

    us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. &l9&rAnd God hearkened

  '11': 'Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. &l4&rBut his father and his mother

    for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel. &l5&rThen went Samson

    time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion:
    and, behold, there'

    thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and

  '27': into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives. &l6&rThen the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had
  '28': taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. &l7&rAnd Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease. &l8&rAnd he smote them
  '29': 'hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top
    of the rock Etam. &l9&rThen the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and
    spread themselves in Lehi. &l10&rAnd the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up

  '30': answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us. &l11&rThen three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast
  '31': done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them. &l12&rAnd they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye
  '32': 'will not fall upon me yourselves. &l13&rAnd they spake unto him, saying,
    No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we
    will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up
    from the rock. &l14&rAnd'
  '33': 'when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit
    of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became
    as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands. &l15&rAnd
    he found a new'
  '34': jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith. &l16&rAnd Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men. &l17&rAnd it came to pass, when he had made
  '35': 'an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called
    that place Ramathlehi. &l18&rAnd he was sore athirst, and called on the Lord,
    and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant:
    and now shall I die'
  '36': 'for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised? &l19&rBut God clave
    an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he
    had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name
    thereof Enhakkore,'

    Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her. &l2&rAnd

    the'
  '39': night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him. &l3&rAnd Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his
  '40': shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron. &l4&rAnd it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. &l5&rAnd the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her,
  '41': Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver. &l6&rAnd Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray
  '42': thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee. &l7&rAnd Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. &l8&rThen the lords of
  '43': the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. &l9&rNow there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the
  '44': 'withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength
    was not known. &l10&rAnd Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me,
    and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.
    &l11&rAnd he said'
  '45': unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. &l12&rDelilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were
  '46': 'liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms
    like a thread. &l13&rAnd Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me,
    and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her,
    If thou weavest the'
  '47': seven locks of my head with the web. &l14&rAnd she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web. &l15&rAnd she said unto him, How
  '48': canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth. &l16&rAnd it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his
  '49': 'soul was vexed unto death; &l17&rThat he told her all his heart, and said
    unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite
    unto God from my mother''s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from
    me, and I shall become'
  '50': weak, and be like any other man.

    &l18&rAnd when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called
    for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed
    me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and'
  '2': brought money in their hand. &l19&rAnd she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. &l20&rAnd she said, The
  '3': Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him. &l21&rBut the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought
  '4': him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house. &l22&rHowbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven. &l23&rThen the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great
  '5': 'sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath
    delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. &l24&rAnd when the people saw him, they
    praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy,
    and the'
  '6': 'destroyer of our country, which slew many of us. &l25&rAnd it came to pass,
    when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make
    us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them
    sport: and they set'
  '7': him between the pillars. &l26&rAnd Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them. &l27&rNow the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the
  '8': Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. &l28&rAnd Samson called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this
  '9': once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. &l29&rAnd Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.
  '10': '&l30&rAnd Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself
    with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people
    that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they
    which he slew in his'
  '11': life. &l31&rThen his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
  '12': 'Chapter 17

    And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah. &l2&rAnd he said unto
    his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about
    which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with'
  '13': me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the Lord, my son. &l3&rAnd when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the Lord from my hand for my son, to make a
  '14': 'graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
    &l4&rYet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred
    shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image
    and a molten image:'
  '15': and they were in the house of Micah. &l5&rAnd the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. &l6&rIn those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was
  '16': 'right in his own eyes. &l7&rAnd there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah
    of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. &l8&rAnd the
    man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find
    a place: and he came'
  '17': to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. &l9&rAnd Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place. &l10&rAnd Micah said unto him, Dwell with me,
  '18': and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in. &l11&rAnd the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of
  '19': his sons. &l12&rAnd Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. &l13&rThen said Micah, Now know I that the Lord will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.
  '20': 'Chapter 18

    In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the
    Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance
    had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel. &l2&rAnd the children of'
  '21': 'Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from
    Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said
    unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house
    of Micah, they lodged'
  '22': 'there. &l3&rWhen they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of
    the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought
    thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here? &l4&rAnd
    he said unto'
  '23': them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest. &l5&rAnd they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous. &l6&rAnd the priest said unto them, Go in
  '24': 'peace: before the Lord is your way wherein ye go. &l7&rThen the five men
    departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt
    careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no
    magistrate in the'
  '25': 'land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the
    Zidonians, and had no business with any man. &l8&rAnd they came unto their brethren
    to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye? &l9&rAnd
    they said, Arise,'
  '26': 'that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it
    is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess
    the land. &l10&rWhen ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large
    land: for God hath'
  '27': given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth. &l11&rAnd there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war. &l12&rAnd they went
  '28': 'up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place
    Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim. &l13&rAnd they passed
    thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah. &l14&rThen answered
    the five men'
  '29': that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do. &l15&rAnd they turned thitherward,
  '30': and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him. &l16&rAnd the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate. &l17&rAnd the five
  '31': 'men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took
    the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the
    priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed
    with weapons of'
  '32': war. &l18&rAnd these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye? &l19&rAnd they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go
  '33': 'with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be
    a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and
    a family in Israel? &l20&rAnd the priest''s heart was glad, and he took the ephod,
    and the teraphim, and'
  '34': the graven image, and went in the midst of the people. &l21&rSo they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them. &l22&rAnd when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near
  '35': to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan. &l23&rAnd they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company? &l24&rAnd he said, Ye have
  '36': 'taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and
    what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee? &l25&rAnd
    the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry
    fellows run'
  '37': 'upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household. &l26&rAnd
    the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong
    for him, he turned and went back unto his house. &l27&rAnd they took the things
    which Micah had'
  '38': 'made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that
    were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and
    burnt the city with fire. &l28&rAnd there was no deliverer, because it was far
    from Zidon, and they had'
  '39': 'no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob.
    And they built a city, and dwelt therein. &l29&rAnd they called the name of the
    city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit
    the name of the city'
  '40': 'was Laish at the first. &l30&rAnd the children of Dan set up the graven image:
    and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests
    to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. &l31&rAnd they
    set them up'
  '41': Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
  '42': 'Chapter 19

    And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there
    was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him
    a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah. &l2&rAnd his concubine played the whore against
    him,'
  '43': 'and went away from him unto her father''s house to Bethlehemjudah, and was
    there four whole months. &l3&rAnd her husband arose, and went after her, to speak
    friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a
    couple of asses: and'
  '44': 'she brought him into her father''s house: and when the father of the damsel
    saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. &l4&rAnd his father in law, the damsel''s father,
    retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and
    lodged there.'
  '45': '&l5&rAnd it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the
    morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel''s father said unto his son
    in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.
    &l6&rAnd they sat down,'
  '46': 'and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel''s father had
    said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine
    heart be merry. &l7&rAnd when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged
    him: therefore he'
  '47': lodged there again. &l8&rAnd he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them. &l9&rAnd when the man rose up to depart,
  '48': 'he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel''s
    father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you
    tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart
    may be merry; and to'
  '49': morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home. &l10&rBut the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with
  '50': him. &l11&rAnd when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

    &l12&rAnd his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city
    of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.
    &l13&rAnd he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of'
  '2': these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah. &l14&rAnd they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin. &l15&rAnd they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in
  '3': 'Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for
    there was no man that took them into his house to lodging. &l16&rAnd, behold,
    there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of
    mount Ephraim; and he'

    and there is no man that receiveth me to house. &l19&rYet there is both straw
    and provender for our'

    for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing. &l20&rAnd
    the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me;
    only lodge not'
  '7': 'in the street. &l21&rSo he brought him into his house, and gave provender
    unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink. &l22&rNow as
    they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons
    of Belial, beset the'
  '8': house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him. &l23&rAnd the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them,
  '9': Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly. &l24&rBehold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what
  '10': 'seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing. &l25&rBut
    the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her
    forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning:
    and when the day'
  '11': began to spring, they let her go. &l26&rThen came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light. &l27&rAnd her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and
  '12': 'went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down
    at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold. &l28&rAnd he
    said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her
    up upon an ass, and'
  '13': the man rose up, and gat him unto his place. &l29&rAnd when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel. &l30&rAnd it
  '14': 'was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from

    Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together
    as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the Lord
    in Mizpeh. &l2&rAnd the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of'
  '16': Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword. &l3&r(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how
  '17': was this wickedness? &l4&rAnd the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge. &l5&rAnd the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about
  '18': 'upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they
    forced, that she is dead. &l6&rAnd I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces,
    and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they
    have committed lewdness'
  '19': and folly in Israel. &l7&rBehold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel. &l8&rAnd all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house. &l9&rBut now this
  '20': shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it; &l10&rAnd we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the
  '21': people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel. &l11&rSo all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man. &l12&rAnd the tribes of Israel sent men
  '22': through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you? &l13&rNow therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children
  '23': of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel. &l14&rBut the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel. &l15&rAnd the children
  '24': of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men. &l16&rAmong all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
  '25': 'lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.
    &l17&rAnd the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand
    men that drew sword: all these were men of war. &l18&rAnd the children of Israel
    arose, and went up'
  '26': to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the Lord said, Judah shall go up first. &l19&rAnd the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against
  '27': Gibeah. &l20&rAnd the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah. &l21&rAnd the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the
  '28': Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men. &l22&rAnd the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day. &l23&r(And the children of Israel went up and
  '29': wept before the Lord until even, and asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the Lord said, Go up against him.) &l24&rAnd the children of Israel came near against the children of
  '30': Benjamin the second day. &l25&rAnd Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. &l26&rThen all the children of Israel, and
  '31': all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the Lord, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord. &l27&rAnd the children of Israel enquired of the Lord, (for
  '32': the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, &l28&rAnd Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And
  '33': the Lord said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand. &l29&rAnd Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah. &l30&rAnd the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against
  '34': Gibeah, as at other times. &l31&rAnd the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God,
  '35': and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel. &l32&rAnd the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.
  '36': '&l33&rAnd all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves
    in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their
    places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah. &l34&rAnd there came against Gibeah
    ten thousand chosen'
  '37': 'men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil
    was near them. &l35&rAnd the Lord smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children
    of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an
    hundred men: all'
  '38': 'these drew the sword. &l36&rSo the children of Benjamin saw that they were
    smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted
    unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah. &l37&rAnd the liers in
    wait hasted, and'
  '39': rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword. &l38&rNow there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise
  '40': 'up out of the city. &l39&rAnd when the men of Israel retired in the battle,
    Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for
    they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle. &l40&rBut
    when the flame'
  '41': 'began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites
    looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.
    &l41&rAnd when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed:
    for they saw that evil'
  '42': was come upon them. &l42&rTherefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them. &l43&rThus they inclosed the
  '43': Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising. &l44&rAnd there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour. &l45&rAnd they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto
  '44': 'the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand
    men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
    &l46&rSo that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand
    men that drew the'
  '45': sword; all these were men of valour. &l47&rBut six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months. &l48&rAnd the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the
  '46': 'edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that
    came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.'
  '47': 'Chapter 21

    Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give
    his daughter unto Benjamin to wife. &l2&rAnd the people came to the house of God,
    and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;'
  '48': '&l3&rAnd said, O Lord God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel,
    that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel? &l4&rAnd it came to pass
    on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered
    burnt offerings and'
  '49': peace offerings. &l5&rAnd the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the Lord? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the Lord to Mizpeh, saying, He shall
  '50': surely be put to death. &l6&rAnd the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.

  '1': 'Chapter 21 Cont.

    &l7&rHow shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the
    Lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives? &l8&rAnd they said,
    What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the'
  '2': Lord? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly. &l9&rFor the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there. &l10&rAnd the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
  '3': valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children. &l11&rAnd this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath
  '4': 'lain by man. &l12&rAnd they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four
    hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they
    brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. &l13&rAnd
    the whole'
  '5': 'congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the
    rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them. &l14&rAnd Benjamin came again at
    that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of
    Jabeshgilead: and yet'
  '6': so they sufficed them not. &l15&rAnd the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. &l16&rThen the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women
  '7': 'are destroyed out of Benjamin? &l17&rAnd they said, There must be an inheritance
    for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
    &l18&rHowbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of
    Israel have'
  '8': sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin. &l19&rThen they said, Behold, there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem,
  '9': and on the south of Lebonah. &l20&rTherefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards; &l21&rAnd see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and
  '10': 'catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land
    of Benjamin. &l22&rAnd it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come
    unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our
    sakes: because we'
  '11': 'reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them
    at this time, that ye should be guilty. &l23&rAnd the children of Benjamin did
    so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom
    they caught: and they'
  '12': went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them. &l24&rAnd the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
  '13': '&l25&rIn those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which
    was right in his own eyes.'
