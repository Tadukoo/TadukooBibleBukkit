  '1': 'Chapter 1

    How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as
    a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces,
    how is she become tributary! &l2&rShe weepeth sore in the night, and her tears
    are on'
  '2': 'her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends
    have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies. &l3&rJudah is
    gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she
    dwelleth among the'
  '3': 'heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the
    straits. &l4&rThe ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts:
    all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she
    is in bitterness.'
  '4': '&l5&rHer adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the Lord hath
    afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into
    captivity before the enemy. &l6&rAnd from the daughter of Zion all her beauty
    is departed: her'
  '5': princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer. &l7&rJerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people
  '6': 'fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw
    her, and did mock at her sabbaths. &l8&rJerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore
    she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her
    nakedness: yea,'
  '7': 'she sigheth, and turneth backward. &l9&rHer filthiness is in her skirts; she
    remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no
    comforter. O Lord, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.
    &l10&rThe adversary'
  '8': 'hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that
    the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should
    not enter into thy congregation. &l11&rAll her people sigh, they seek bread; they
    have given'
  '9': 'their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O Lord, and consider;
    for I am become vile. &l12&rIs it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold,
    and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith
    the Lord hath'
  '10': 'afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger. &l13&rFrom above hath he sent
    fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my
    feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.
    &l14&rThe yoke of my'
  '11': 'transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon
    my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into their
    hands, from whom I am not able to rise up. &l15&rThe Lord hath trodden under foot
    all my mighty men in'
  '12': 'the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young
    men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.
    &l16&rFor these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because
    the comforter that'
  '13': 'should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because
    the enemy prevailed. &l17&rZion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to
    comfort her: the Lord hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should
    be round about him:'
  '14': 'Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them. &l18&rThe Lord is righteous;
    for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and
    behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. &l19&rI
    called for my lovers,'
  '15': 'but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the
    city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls. &l20&rBehold, O Lord;
    for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me;
    for I have grievously'
  '16': 'rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death. &l21&rThey
    have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard
    of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that
    thou hast called,'
  '17': 'and they shall be like unto me. &l22&rLet all their wickedness come before
    thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for
    my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.'
  '18': 'Chapter 2

    How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and
    cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not
    his footstool in the day of his anger! &l2&rThe Lord hath swallowed up all the
    habitations'
  '19': 'of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong
    holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath
    polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof. &l3&rHe hath cut off in his fierce
    anger all the horn'
  '20': 'of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he
    burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. &l4&rHe
    hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary,
    and slew all that were'
  '21': 'pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured
    out his fury like fire. &l5&rThe Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel,
    he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and
    hath increased in the'
  '22': 'daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation. &l6&rAnd he hath violently taken
    away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of
    the assembly: the Lord hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten
    in Zion, and hath'
  '23': despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest. &l7&rThe Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the Lord,
  '24': 'as in the day of a solemn feast. &l8&rThe Lord hath purposed to destroy the
    wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn
    his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament;
    they languished'
  '25': 'together. &l9&rHer gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and
    broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no
    more; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord. &l10&rThe elders of the
    daughter of Zion sit upon'
  '26': 'the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they
    have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their
    heads to the ground. &l11&rMine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled,
    my liver is poured'
  '27': upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city. &l12&rThey say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city,
  '28': when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom. &l13&rWhat thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy
  '29': 'breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee? &l14&rThy prophets have
    seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity,
    to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of
    banishment.'
  '30': '&l15&rAll that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their
    head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The
    perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth? &l16&rAll thine enemies have
    opened their mouth against'
  '31': 'thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up:
    certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.
    &l17&rThe Lord hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word
    that he had commanded in'
  '32': 'the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused
    thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
    &l18&rTheir heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears
    run down like a'
  '33': 'river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye
    cease. &l19&rArise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour
    out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward
    him for the life of'
  '34': thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street. &l20&rBehold, O Lord, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary
  '35': 'of the Lord? &l21&rThe young and the old lie on the ground in the streets:
    my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the
    day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied. &l22&rThou hast called as
    in a solemn day my'
  '36': 'terrors round about, so that in the day of the Lord''s anger none escaped
    nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.'
  '37': 'Chapter 3

    I Am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. &l2&rHe hath led
    me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light. &l3&rSurely against me is
    he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day. &l4&rMy flesh and my skin
    hath'
  '38': 'he made old; he hath broken my bones. &l5&rHe hath builded against me, and
    compassed me with gall and travail. &l6&rHe hath set me in dark places, as they
    that be dead of old. &l7&rHe hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath
    made my chain'
  '39': heavy. &l8&rAlso when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. &l9&rHe hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. &l10&rHe was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places. &l11&rHe hath turned aside my
  '40': 'ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. &l12&rHe hath bent
    his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. &l13&rHe hath caused the arrows of
    his quiver to enter into my reins. &l14&rI was a derision to all my people; and
    their song all the'
  '41': 'day. &l15&rHe hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with
    wormwood. &l16&rHe hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered
    me with ashes. &l17&rAnd thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat
    prosperity.'
  '42': '&l18&rAnd I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord: &l19&rRemembering
    mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. &l20&rMy soul hath them
    still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. &l21&rThis I recall to my mind, therefore'
  '43': 'have I hope. &l22&rIt is of the Lord''s mercies that we are not consumed,
    because his compassions fail not. &l23&rThey are new every morning: great is thy
    faithfulness. &l24&rThe Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope
    in him. &l25&rThe'
  '44': Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. &l26&rIt is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord. &l27&rIt is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. &l28&rHe sitteth alone and
  '45': 'keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him. &l29&rHe putteth his
    mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. &l30&rHe giveth his cheek to him
    that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. &l31&rFor the Lord will not
    cast off for ever:'
  '46': '&l32&rBut though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to
    the multitude of his mercies. &l33&rFor he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve
    the children of men. &l34&rTo crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.
    &l35&rTo turn'
  '47': aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, &l36&rTo subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. &l37&rWho is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? &l38&rOut of the mouth of the most High proceedeth
  '48': not evil and good? &l39&rWherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? &l40&rLet us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. &l41&rLet us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. &l42&rWe have
  '49': 'transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. &l43&rThou hast covered
    with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. &l44&rThou
    hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through. &l45&rThou
    hast'
  '50': made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. &l46&rAll our enemies have opened their mouths against us. &l47&rFear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

  '1': 'Chapter 3 Cont.

    &l48&rMine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter
    of my people. &l49&rMine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission.
    &l50&rTill the Lord look down, and behold from heaven. &l51&rMine'
  '2': eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. &l52&rMine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. &l53&rThey have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. &l54&rWaters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am
  '3': 'cut off. &l55&rI called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon. &l56&rThou
    hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. &l57&rThou
    drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. &l58&rO

  '7': 'Chapter 4

    How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the
    sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street. &l2&rThe precious sons of
    Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the
    work of'
  '8': 'the hands of the potter! &l3&rEven the sea monsters draw out the breast, they
    give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like
    the ostriches in the wilderness. &l4&rThe tongue of the sucking child cleaveth
    to the roof of his'
  '9': 'mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto
    them. &l5&rThey that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that
    were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. &l6&rFor the punishment of the iniquity
    of the'
  '10': daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her. &l7&rHer Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their
  '11': 'polishing was of sapphire: &l8&rTheir visage is blacker than a coal; they
    are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered,
    it is become like a stick. &l9&rThey that be slain with the sword are better than
    they that be slain'
  '12': 'with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits
    of the field. &l10&rThe hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:
    they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. &l11&rThe
    Lord hath'
  '13': accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof. &l12&rThe kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and
  '14': the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem. &l13&rFor the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, &l14&rThey have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have
  '15': 'polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.
    &l15&rThey cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not:
    when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more
    sojourn there.'
  '16': '&l16&rThe anger of the Lord hath divided them; he will no more regard them:
    they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. &l17&rAs
    for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched
    for a nation'
  '17': 'that could not save us. &l18&rThey hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our
    streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. &l19&rOur
    persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the
    mountains, they'
  '18': laid wait for us in the wilderness. &l20&rThe breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. &l21&rRejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the
  '19': 'land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken,

  '21': 'Chapter 5

    Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach. &l2&rOur
    inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. &l3&rWe are orphans
    and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. &l4&rWe have drunken our water for
    money;'
  '22': 'our wood is sold unto us. &l5&rOur necks are under persecution: we labour,
    and have no rest. &l6&rWe have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians,
    to be satisfied with bread. &l7&rOur fathers have sinned, and are not; and we
    have borne their'
  '23': 'iniquities. &l8&rServants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver
    us out of their hand. &l9&rWe gat our bread with the peril of our lives because
    of the sword of the wilderness. &l10&rOur skin was black like an oven because
    of the terrible'
  '24': 'famine. &l11&rThey ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities
    of Judah. &l12&rPrinces are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were
    not honoured. &l13&rThey took the young men to grind, and the children fell under
    the wood. &l14&rThe'
  '25': 'elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick. &l15&rThe

  '27': so long time? &l21&rTurn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. &l22&rBut thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
