  '1': Chapter 1/nAnd the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, &l2&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring your offering of
  '2': 'the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock. &l3&rIf his offering be a
    burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer
    it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
    before the Lord.'
  '3': '&l4&rAnd he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it
    shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. &l5&rAnd he shall kill the
    bullock before the Lord: and the priests, Aaron''s sons, shall bring the blood,
    and sprinkle the blood'
  '4': round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l6&rAnd he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces. &l7&rAnd the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon
  '5': 'the fire: &l8&rAnd the priests, Aaron''s sons, shall lay the parts, the head,
    and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
    &l9&rBut his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall
    burn all on the'
  '6': altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord. &l10&rAnd if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish. &l11&rAnd he
  '7': 'shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord: and the
    priests, Aaron''s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar. &l12&rAnd
    he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall
    lay them in'
  '8': 'order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: &l13&rBut he
    shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it
    all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by
    fire, of a sweet savour'
  '9': unto the Lord. &l14&rAnd if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the Lord be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons. &l15&rAnd the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the
  '10': 'altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:
    &l16&rAnd he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the
    altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: &l17&rAnd he shall cleave it
    with the wings'
  '11': 'thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon
    the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering
    made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.'
  '12': 'Chapter 2/nAnd when any will offer a meat offering unto the Lord, his offering
    shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:
    &l2&rAnd he shall bring it to Aaron''s sons the priests: and he shall take thereout
    his'
  '13': 'handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense
    thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an
    offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord: &l3&rAnd the remnant of
    the meat offering'
  '14': 'shall be Aaron''s and his sons'': it is a thing most holy of the offerings
    of the Lord made by fire. &l4&rAnd if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering
    baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil,
    or unleavened wafers'
  '15': 'anointed with oil. &l5&rAnd if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a
    pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. &l6&rThou shalt part
    it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering. &l7&rAnd if thy oblation
    be a meat'
  '16': 'offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
    &l8&rAnd thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto
    the Lord: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the
    altar. &l9&rAnd the'
  '17': 'priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn
    it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the
    Lord. &l10&rAnd that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron''s and
    his sons'': it is a thing'
  '18': 'most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire. &l11&rNo meat offering,
    which ye shall bring unto the Lord, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn
    no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the Lord made by fire. &l12&rAs for
    the oblation of'
  '19': 'the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the Lord: but they shall not be
    burnt on the altar for a sweet savour. &l13&rAnd every oblation of thy meat offering
    shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant
    of thy God to be'
  '20': 'lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer
    salt. &l14&rAnd if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the Lord,
    thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried
    by the fire, even'
  '21': 'corn beaten out of full ears. &l15&rAnd thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay
    frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering. &l16&rAnd the priest shall burn the
    memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof,
    with all the'
  '22': 'frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord.'
  '23': Chapter 3/nAnd if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the Lord. &l2&rAnd he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the
  '24': 'door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron''s sons the priests
    shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. &l3&rAnd he shall offer of
    the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord; the
    fat that covereth the'
  '25': inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, &l4&rAnd the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. &l5&rAnd Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon
  '26': 'the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an
    offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord. &l6&rAnd if his offering
    for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the Lord be of the flock; male or female,
    he shall offer it'
  '27': 'without blemish. &l7&rIf he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he
    offer it before the Lord. &l8&rAnd he shall lay his hand upon the head of his
    offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron''s
    sons shall sprinkle the'
  '28': blood thereof round about upon the altar. &l9&rAnd he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the
  '29': 'inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, &l10&rAnd the two kidneys,
    and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the
    liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. &l11&rAnd the priest shall burn
    it upon the altar:'
  '30': 'it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the Lord. &l12&rAnd if his
    offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the Lord. &l13&rAnd he shall
    lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation:
    and the sons'
  '31': of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. &l14&rAnd he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, &l15&rAnd the two
  '32': 'kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul
    above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. &l16&rAnd the priest
    shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for
    a sweet savour: all'
  '33': the fat is the Lord's. &l17&rIt shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.
  '34': Chapter 4/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of
  '35': 'them: &l3&rIf the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of
    the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock
    without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering. &l4&rAnd he shall bring the
    bullock unto the door'
  '36': of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the Lord. &l5&rAnd the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the
  '37': 'congregation: &l6&rAnd the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and
    sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the vail of the sanctuary.
    &l7&rAnd the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of
    sweet incense'
  '38': before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l8&rAnd he shall take off from it
  '39': all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, &l9&rAnd the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
  '40': 'it shall he take away, &l10&rAs it was taken off from the bullock of the
    sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of
    the burnt offering. &l11&rAnd the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with
    his head, and with his'
  '41': 'legs, and his inwards, and his dung, &l12&rEven the whole bullock shall he
    carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out,
    and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be
    burnt. &l13&rAnd if'
  '42': the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty; &l14&rWhen the
  '43': sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation. &l15&rAnd the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the
  '44': 'bullock before the Lord: and the bullock shall be killed before the Lord.
    &l16&rAnd the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock''s blood to the
    tabernacle of the congregation: &l17&rAnd the priest shall dip his finger in some
    of the blood, and'
  '45': sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, even before the vail. &l18&rAnd he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the Lord, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of
  '46': the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l19&rAnd he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar. &l20&rAnd he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so
  '47': 'shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and
    it shall be forgiven them. &l21&rAnd he shall carry forth the bullock without
    the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for
    the congregation.'
  '48': '&l22&rWhen a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against
    any of the commandments of the Lord his God concerning things which should not
    be done, and is guilty; &l23&rOr if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his
    knowledge; he shall'
  '49': 'bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish: &l24&rAnd
    he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where
    they kill the burnt offering before the Lord: it is a sin offering. &l25&rAnd
    the priest shall take of'
  '50': the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.

  '3': 'of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the
    third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that
    offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall
    bear his iniquity.'
  '4': '&l19&rAnd the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it
    shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.
    &l20&rBut the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings,
    that pertain'
  '5': unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. &l21&rMoreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the
  '6': flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the Lord, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. &l22&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l23&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or
  '7': 'of sheep, or of goat. &l24&rAnd the fat of the beast that dieth of itself,
    and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but
    ye shall in no wise eat of it. &l25&rFor whosoever eateth the fat of the beast,
    of which men offer'
  '8': an offering made by fire unto the Lord, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. &l26&rMoreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. &l27&rWhatsoever soul it be that eateth any
  '9': manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. &l28&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l29&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the Lord shall bring his oblation
  '10': unto the Lord of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. &l30&rHis own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord. &l31&rAnd the
  '11': 'priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron''s
    and his sons''. &l32&rAnd the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for
    an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. &l33&rHe among the
    sons of Aaron, that'
  '12': offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part. &l34&rFor the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given
  '13': them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel. &l35&rThis is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, in the day when he
  '14': presented them to minister unto the Lord in the priest's office; &l36&rWhich the Lord commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations. &l37&rThis is the law of the
  '15': burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; &l38&rWhich the Lord commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the
  '16': children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai.
  '17': Chapter 8/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rTake Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; &l3&rAnd gather thou all the congregation
  '18': together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l4&rAnd Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l5&rAnd Moses said unto the congregation, This is the
  '19': thing which the Lord commanded to be done. &l6&rAnd Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. &l7&rAnd he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded
  '20': 'him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.
    &l8&rAnd he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim
    and the Thummim. &l9&rAnd he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre,
    even upon his'
  '21': forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l10&rAnd Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them. &l11&rAnd he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven
  '22': times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them. &l12&rAnd he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. &l13&rAnd Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them,
  '23': 'and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the Lord commanded
    Moses. &l14&rAnd he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his
    sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering. &l15&rAnd
    he slew it;'
  '24': and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it. &l16&rAnd he took all the fat that was
  '25': upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar. &l17&rBut the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the Lord commanded Moses.
  '26': '&l18&rAnd he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons
    laid their hands upon the head of the ram. &l19&rAnd he killed it; and Moses sprinkled
    the blood upon the altar round about. &l20&rAnd he cut the ram into pieces; and
    Moses burnt'
  '27': 'the head, and the pieces, and the fat. &l21&rAnd he washed the inwards and
    the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt
    sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the Lord; as the
    Lord commanded'
  '28': 'Moses. &l22&rAnd he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron
    and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. &l23&rAnd he slew it;
    and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron''s right ear,
    and upon the thumb'
  '29': 'of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. &l24&rAnd he
    brought Aaron''s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right
    ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their
    right feet: and Moses'
  '30': 'sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. &l25&rAnd he took the fat,
    and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the
    liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder: &l26&rAnd out
    of the basket of'
  '31': 'unleavened bread, that was before the Lord, he took one unleavened cake,
    and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the
    right shoulder: &l27&rAnd he put all upon Aaron''s hands, and upon his sons''
    hands, and waved them for a'
  '32': 'wave offering before the Lord. &l28&rAnd Moses took them from off their hands,
    and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for
    a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord. &l29&rAnd Moses
    took the breast,'
  '33': 'and waved it for a wave offering before the Lord: for of the ram of consecration
    it was Moses'' part; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l30&rAnd Moses took of the
    anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon
    Aaron, and upon'
  '34': his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. &l31&rAnd Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of
  '35': 'the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of
    consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it. &l32&rAnd
    that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. &l33&rAnd
    ye shall not'
  '36': 'go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until
    the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate
    you. &l34&rAs he hath done this day, so the Lord hath commanded to do, to make
    an atonement for'
  '37': 'you. &l35&rTherefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
    congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord, that ye
    die not: for so I am commanded. &l36&rSo Aaron and his sons did all things which
    the Lord commanded by'
  '38': the hand of Moses.
  '39': Chapter 9/nAnd it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; &l2&rAnd he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before
  '40': the Lord. &l3&rAnd unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; &l4&rAlso a bullock and a ram for peace offerings,
  '41': 'to sacrifice before the Lord; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to
    day the Lord will appear unto you. &l5&rAnd they brought that which Moses commanded
    before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near
    and stood before'
  '42': 'the Lord. &l6&rAnd Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded
    that ye should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you. &l7&rAnd Moses
    said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt
    offering, and make an'
  '43': 'atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the
    people, and make an atonement for them; as the Lord commanded. &l8&rAaron therefore
    went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
    &l9&rAnd the'
  '44': 'sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the
    blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the
    bottom of the altar: &l10&rBut the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the
    liver of the sin'
  '45': offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l11&rAnd the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. &l12&rAnd he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon
  '46': 'the altar. &l13&rAnd they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the
    pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar. &l14&rAnd he did
    wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.
    &l15&rAnd he'
  '47': brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. &l16&rAnd he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner. &l17&rAnd he brought the meat
  '48': 'offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside
    the burnt sacrifice of the morning. &l18&rHe slew also the bullock and the ram
    for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron''s sons
    presented unto him the'
  '49': 'blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, &l19&rAnd the fat of
    the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and
    the kidneys, and the caul above the liver: &l20&rAnd they put the fat upon the
    breasts, and he burnt'
  '50': 'the fat upon the altar: &l21&rAnd the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron
    waved for a wave offering before the Lord; as Moses commanded.'

  '1': Chapter 9 Cont./n&l22&rAnd Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings. &l23&rAnd Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,
  '2': 'and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto
    all the people. &l24&rAnd there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed
    upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw,
    they shouted, and'
  '3': fell on their faces.
  '4': Chapter 10/nAnd Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not. &l2&rAnd there went out fire from the Lord, and
  '5': devoured them, and they died before the Lord. &l3&rThen Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace. &l4&rAnd Moses
  '6': called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. &l5&rSo they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
  '7': '&l6&rAnd Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons,
    Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath
    come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail
    the burning which'
  '8': 'the Lord hath kindled. &l7&rAnd ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle
    of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you.
    And they did according to the word of Moses. &l8&rAnd the Lord spake unto Aaron,
    saying,'
  '9': '&l9&rDo not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when
    ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute
    for ever throughout your generations: &l10&rAnd that ye may put difference between
    holy and'
  '10': unholy, and between unclean and clean; &l11&rAnd that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses. &l12&rAnd Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were
  '11': 'left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord
    made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:
    &l13&rAnd ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons''
    due, of the sacrifices'
  '12': 'of the Lord made by fire: for so I am commanded. &l14&rAnd the wave breast
    and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy
    daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons'' due, which are given
    out of the sacrifices of'
  '13': peace offerings of the children of Israel. &l15&rThe heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a
  '14': 'statute for ever; as the Lord hath commanded. &l16&rAnd Moses diligently
    sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry
    with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, &l17&rWherefore
    have ye not'
  '15': 'eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God
    hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement
    for them before the Lord? &l18&rBehold, the blood of it was not brought in within
    the holy place: ye'
  '16': 'should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded. &l19&rAnd
    Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and
    their burnt offering before the Lord; and such things have befallen me: and if
    I had eaten the sin'
  '17': offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord? &l20&rAnd when Moses heard that, he was content.
  '18': Chapter 11/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, &l2&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. &l3&rWhatsoever parteth the hoof, and is
  '19': 'clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. &l4&rNevertheless
    these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof:
    as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean'
  '20': unto you. &l5&rAnd the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. &l6&rAnd the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. &l7&rAnd the swine, though he divide the hoof,
  '21': 'and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. &l8&rOf
    their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean
    to you. &l9&rThese shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath
    fins and'
  '22': scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. &l10&rAnd all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an
  '23': 'abomination unto you: &l11&rThey shall be even an abomination unto you; ye
    shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.
    &l12&rWhatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination
    unto you.'
  '24': '&l13&rAnd these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls;
    they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage,
    and the ospray, &l14&rAnd the vulture, and the kite after his kind; &l15&rEvery
    raven after his'

  '26': kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. &l20&rAll fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you. &l21&rYet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon
  '27': the earth; &l22&rEven these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind. &l23&rBut all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an
  '28': 'abomination unto you. &l24&rAnd for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever
    toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even. &l25&rAnd whosoever
    beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until
    the even. &l26&rThe'

    and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you. &l29&rThese also shall
    be unclean unto'
  '31': 'you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and
    the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind, &l30&rAnd the ferret, and the chameleon,
    and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole. &l31&rThese are unclean to you among
    all that creep:'
  '32': whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even. &l32&rAnd upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it

  '34': 'all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean:
    and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean. &l35&rAnd
    every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether
    it be oven, or'
  '35': 'ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall
    be unclean unto you. &l36&rNevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty
    of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.
    &l37&rAnd if any'
  '36': part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean. &l38&rBut if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you. &l39&rAnd if any beast, of which ye may eat, die;
  '37': 'he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even. &l40&rAnd
    he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until
    the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be
    unclean until'
  '38': the even. &l41&rAnd every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten. &l42&rWhatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that
  '39': creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination. &l43&rYe shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. &l44&rFor
  '40': 'I am the Lord your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall
    be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of
    creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. &l45&rFor I am the Lord that bringeth
    you up out of the'
  '41': 'land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
    &l46&rThis is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature
    that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:
    &l47&rTo make a'
  '42': difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
  '43': 'Chapter 12/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rSpeak unto the children

  '45': 'of her purifying be fulfilled. &l5&rBut if she bear a maid child, then she
    shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the
    blood of her purifying threescore and six days. &l6&rAnd when the days of her
    purifying are'

    because of their'

    &l17&rAnd there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he
    goeth in to make an'

  '10': 'shall leave them there: &l24&rAnd he shall wash his flesh with water in the
    holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering,
    and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for
    the people.'
  '11': '&l25&rAnd the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar. &l26&rAnd
    he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
    flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp. &l27&rAnd the bullock for the
    sin offering, and'
  '12': the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. &l28&rAnd he that burneth them shall wash

    month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work
    at all, whether'

  '19': Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp, &l4&rAnd bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord; blood shall
  '20': 'be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off

    unto the Lord, unto'
  '21': the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the Lord. &l6&rAnd the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat
  '22': for a sweet savour unto the Lord. &l7&rAnd they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations. &l8&rAnd thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever
  '23': man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, &l9&rAnd bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the Lord; even that man shall be
  '24': cut off from among his people. &l10&rAnd whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from
  '25': 'among his people. &l11&rFor the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I
    have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it
    is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul. &l12&rTherefore I said unto
    the children of Israel,'
  '26': No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. &l13&rAnd whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may
  '27': 'be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
    &l14&rFor it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof:
    therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner
    of flesh: for the'
  '28': 'life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut
    off. &l15&rAnd every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which
    was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he
    shall both wash his'
  '29': 'clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then
    shall he be clean. &l16&rBut if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he
    shall bear his iniquity.'

    and ye shall sow'
  '48': 'your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. &l17&rAnd I will set my
    face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you
    shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. &l18&rAnd if ye
    will not yet for all'
  '49': 'this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
    &l19&rAnd I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as
    iron, and your earth as brass: &l20&rAnd your strength shall be spent in vain:
    for your land shall'
  '50': not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. &l21&rAnd if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.

  '1': Chapter 26 Cont./n&l22&rI will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate. &l23&rAnd if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but
  '2': 'will walk contrary unto me; &l24&rThen will I also walk contrary unto you,
    and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. &l25&rAnd I will bring a sword
    upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered
    together within'
  '3': your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. &l26&rAnd when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by
  '4': 'weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. &l27&rAnd if ye will not for
    all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; &l28&rThen I will walk contrary
    unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
    &l29&rAnd'
  '5': ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. &l30&rAnd I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. &l31&rAnd I will
  '6': 'make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I
    will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. &l32&rAnd I will bring the land
    into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
    &l33&rAnd I will'
  '7': 'scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your
    land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. &l34&rThen shall the land enjoy
    her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies'' land;
    even then shall the'
  '8': land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. &l35&rAs long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. &l36&rAnd upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of
  '9': 'their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall
    flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. &l37&rAnd
    they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth:
    and ye shall'
  '10': have no power to stand before your enemies. &l38&rAnd ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. &l39&rAnd they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities
  '11': of their fathers shall they pine away with them. &l40&rIf they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; &l41&rAnd that I also
  '12': 'have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their
    enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of
    the punishment of their iniquity: &l42&rThen will I remember my covenant with
    Jacob, and also my'
  '13': 'covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and
    I will remember the land. &l43&rThe land also shall be left of them, and shall
    enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept
    of the punishment of'
  '14': 'their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because
    their soul abhorred my statutes. &l44&rAnd yet for all that, when they be in the
    land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to
    destroy them'
  '15': 'utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the Lord their God.
    &l45&rBut I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom
    I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might
    be their God: I am'
  '16': the Lord. &l46&rThese are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
  '17': Chapter 27/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation. &l3&rAnd thy estimation shall be of the male from
  '18': twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. &l4&rAnd if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. &l5&rAnd if it be from five years old even unto
  '19': twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. &l6&rAnd if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy
  '20': estimation shall be three shekels of silver. &l7&rAnd if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. &l8&rBut if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall
  '21': present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him. &l9&rAnd if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the Lord, all that any man giveth of such unto the Lord shall
  '22': 'be holy. &l10&rHe shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or
    a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the
    exchange thereof shall be holy. &l11&rAnd if it be any unclean beast, of which
    they do not offer a'
  '23': 'sacrifice unto the Lord, then he shall present the beast before the priest:
    &l12&rAnd the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest
    it, who art the priest, so shall it be. &l13&rBut if he will at all redeem it,
    then he shall add a'
  '24': 'fifth part thereof unto thy estimation. &l14&rAnd when a man shall sanctify
    his house to be holy unto the Lord, then the priest shall estimate it, whether
    it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand. &l15&rAnd
    if he that'
  '25': sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his. &l16&rAnd if a man shall sanctify unto the Lord some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be
  '26': 'according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at
    fifty shekels of silver. &l17&rIf he sanctify his field from the year of jubile,
    according to thy estimation it shall stand. &l18&rBut if he sanctify his field
    after the jubile, then'
  '27': the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation. &l19&rAnd if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth
  '28': part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him. &l20&rAnd if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. &l21&rBut the field, when it goeth out in the jubile,
  '29': shall be holy unto the Lord, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's. &l22&rAnd if a man sanctify unto the Lord a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession; &l23&rThen the priest shall reckon unto him
  '30': 'the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall
    give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the Lord. &l24&rIn the
    year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even
    to him to whom the'
  '31': 'possession of the land did belong. &l25&rAnd all thy estimations shall be
    according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. &l26&rOnly
    the firstling of the beasts, which should be the Lord''s firstling, no man shall
    sanctify it;'
  '32': 'whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the Lord''s. &l27&rAnd if it be of an unclean
    beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a
    fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according
    to thy'
  '33': 'estimation. &l28&rNotwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote
    unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of
    his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto
    the Lord. &l29&rNone'
  '34': 'devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely
    be put to death. &l30&rAnd all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
    land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord''s: it is holy unto the Lord. &l31&rAnd
    if a man will'
  '35': at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof. &l32&rAnd concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord. &l33&rHe shall not search whether
  '36': 'it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all,
    then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. &l34&rThese
    are the commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel
    in mount'
  '37': Sinai.
