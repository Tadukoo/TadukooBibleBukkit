    And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the
    congregation, saying, &l2&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,
    If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring your offering
    of'
  '2': 'the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock. &l3&rIf his offering be a
    burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer
    it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
    before the Lord.'
  '3': '&l4&rAnd he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it
    shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. &l5&rAnd he shall kill the
    bullock before the Lord: and the priests, Aaron''s sons, shall bring the blood,
    and sprinkle the blood'
  '4': round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l6&rAnd he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces. &l7&rAnd the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon
  '5': 'the fire: &l8&rAnd the priests, Aaron''s sons, shall lay the parts, the head,
    and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
    &l9&rBut his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall
    burn all on the'
  '6': altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord. &l10&rAnd if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish. &l11&rAnd he
  '7': 'shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord: and the
    priests, Aaron''s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar. &l12&rAnd
    he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall
    lay them in'

    shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it
    all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by
    fire, of a sweet savour'
  '9': unto the Lord. &l14&rAnd if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the Lord be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons. &l15&rAnd the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the
  '10': 'altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:

    it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the
    Lord. &l10&rAnd that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron''s and
    his sons'': it is a thing'

  '2': 'offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and
    on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten: &l17&rBut the remainder
    of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire. &l18&rAnd
    if any of the'
  '3': 'flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third
    day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth
    it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his
    iniquity. &l19&rAnd'
  '4': 'the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be

  '6': the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the Lord, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. &l22&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l23&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep,
  '7': 'or of goat. &l24&rAnd the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat
    of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall
    in no wise eat of it. &l25&rFor whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which
    men offer an offering'
  '8': made by fire unto the Lord, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. &l26&rMoreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. &l27&rWhatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of
  '9': blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. &l28&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l29&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the Lord shall bring his oblation unto the Lord
  '10': of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. &l30&rHis own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord. &l31&rAnd the priest shall burn
  '11': 'the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron''s and his sons''.
    &l32&rAnd the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering
    of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. &l33&rHe among the sons of Aaron, that
    offereth the blood of'
  '12': the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part. &l34&rFor the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the
  '13': priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel. &l35&rThis is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, in the day when he presented them to
  '14': minister unto the Lord in the priest's office; &l36&rWhich the Lord commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations. &l37&rThis is the law of the burnt offering, of
  '15': the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; &l38&rWhich the Lord commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to
  '16': offer their oblations unto the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai.
  '17': 'Chapter 8

    And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rTake Aaron and his sons with him,
    and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and
    two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; &l3&rAnd gather thou all the congregation'
  '18': together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l4&rAnd Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l5&rAnd Moses said unto the congregation, This is the
  '19': thing which the Lord commanded to be done. &l6&rAnd Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. &l7&rAnd he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded
  '20': 'him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.
    &l8&rAnd he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim
    and the Thummim. &l9&rAnd he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre,
    even upon his'
  '21': forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l10&rAnd Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them. &l11&rAnd he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven
  '22': times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them. &l12&rAnd he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. &l13&rAnd Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them,
  '23': 'and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the Lord commanded
    Moses. &l14&rAnd he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his
    sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering. &l15&rAnd
    he slew it;'
  '24': and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it. &l16&rAnd he took all the fat that was
  '25': upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar. &l17&rBut the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the Lord commanded Moses.
  '26': '&l18&rAnd he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons
    laid their hands upon the head of the ram. &l19&rAnd he killed it; and Moses sprinkled
    the blood upon the altar round about. &l20&rAnd he cut the ram into pieces; and
    Moses burnt'
  '27': 'the head, and the pieces, and the fat. &l21&rAnd he washed the inwards and
    the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt
    sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the Lord; as the
    Lord commanded'
  '28': 'Moses. &l22&rAnd he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron
    and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. &l23&rAnd he slew it;
    and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron''s right ear,
    and upon the thumb'
  '29': 'of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. &l24&rAnd he
    brought Aaron''s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right
    ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their
    right feet: and Moses'
  '30': 'sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. &l25&rAnd he took the fat,
    and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the
    liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder: &l26&rAnd out
    of the basket of'
  '31': 'unleavened bread, that was before the Lord, he took one unleavened cake,
    and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the
    right shoulder: &l27&rAnd he put all upon Aaron''s hands, and upon his sons''
    hands, and waved them for a'
  '32': 'wave offering before the Lord. &l28&rAnd Moses took them from off their hands,
    and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for
    a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord. &l29&rAnd Moses
    took the breast,'
  '33': 'and waved it for a wave offering before the Lord: for of the ram of consecration
    it was Moses'' part; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l30&rAnd Moses took of the
    anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon
    Aaron, and upon'
  '34': his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. &l31&rAnd Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of
  '35': 'the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of
    consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it. &l32&rAnd
    that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. &l33&rAnd
    ye shall not'
  '36': 'go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until
    the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate
    you. &l34&rAs he hath done this day, so the Lord hath commanded to do, to make
    an atonement for'
  '37': 'you. &l35&rTherefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
    congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord, that ye
    die not: for so I am commanded. &l36&rSo Aaron and his sons did all things which
    the Lord commanded by'
  '38': the hand of Moses.
  '39': 'Chapter 9

    And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and
    the elders of Israel; &l2&rAnd he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for
    a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them
    before'
  '40': the Lord. &l3&rAnd unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; &l4&rAlso a bullock and a ram for peace offerings,
  '41': 'to sacrifice before the Lord; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to
    day the Lord will appear unto you. &l5&rAnd they brought that which Moses commanded
    before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near
    and stood before'
  '42': 'the Lord. &l6&rAnd Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded
    that ye should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you. &l7&rAnd Moses
    said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt
    offering, and make an'

    people, and make an atonement for them; as the Lord commanded. &l8&rAaron therefore
    went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
    &l9&rAnd the'
  '44': 'sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the
    blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the
    bottom of the altar: &l10&rBut the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the
    liver of the sin'
  '45': offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l11&rAnd the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. &l12&rAnd he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon
  '46': 'the altar. &l13&rAnd they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the
    pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar. &l14&rAnd he did
    wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.
    &l15&rAnd he'
  '47': brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. &l16&rAnd he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner. &l17&rAnd he brought the meat
  '48': 'offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside
    the burnt sacrifice of the morning. &l18&rHe slew also the bullock and the ram
    for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron''s sons
    presented unto him the'

    shall make you afraid:'
  '43': and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. &l7&rAnd ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. &l8&rAnd five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten
  '44': 'thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
    &l9&rFor I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you,
    and establish my covenant with you. &l10&rAnd ye shall eat old store, and bring
    forth the old because'
  '45': 'of the new. &l11&rAnd I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not
    abhor you. &l12&rAnd I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall
    be my people. &l13&rI am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the
    land of Egypt, that ye'
  '46': should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright. &l14&rBut if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; &l15&rAnd if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments,
  '47': 'so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:
    &l16&rI also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption,
    and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart:
    and ye shall sow'
  '48': 'your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. &l17&rAnd I will set my
    face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you
    shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. &l18&rAnd if ye
    will not yet for all'
  '49': 'this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
    &l19&rAnd I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as
    iron, and your earth as brass: &l20&rAnd your strength shall be spent in vain:
    for your land shall'
  '50': not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. &l21&rAnd if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.

  '1': 'Chapter 26 Cont.

    &l22&rI will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children,
    and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall
    be desolate. &l23&rAnd if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but'
  '2': 'will walk contrary unto me; &l24&rThen will I also walk contrary unto you,
    and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. &l25&rAnd I will bring a sword
    upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered
    together within'
  '3': your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. &l26&rAnd when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by
  '4': 'weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. &l27&rAnd if ye will not for
    all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; &l28&rThen I will walk contrary
    unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
    &l29&rAnd'
  '5': ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. &l30&rAnd I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. &l31&rAnd I will
  '6': 'make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I
    will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. &l32&rAnd I will bring the land
    into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
    &l33&rAnd I will'
  '7': 'scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your
    land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. &l34&rThen shall the land enjoy
    her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies'' land;
    even then shall the'
  '8': land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. &l35&rAs long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. &l36&rAnd upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of
  '9': 'their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall
    flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. &l37&rAnd
    they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth:
    and ye shall'
  '10': have no power to stand before your enemies. &l38&rAnd ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. &l39&rAnd they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities
  '11': of their fathers shall they pine away with them. &l40&rIf they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; &l41&rAnd that I also
  '12': 'have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their
    enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of
    the punishment of their iniquity: &l42&rThen will I remember my covenant with
    Jacob, and also my'
  '13': 'covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and
    I will remember the land. &l43&rThe land also shall be left of them, and shall
    enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept
    of the punishment of'
  '14': 'their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because
    their soul abhorred my statutes. &l44&rAnd yet for all that, when they be in the
    land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to
    destroy them'
  '15': 'utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the Lord their God.

    I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might
    be their God: I am'
  '16': the Lord. &l46&rThese are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
  '17': 'Chapter 27

    And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rSpeak unto the children of Israel,
    and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be
    for the Lord by thy estimation. &l3&rAnd thy estimation shall be of the male from
    twenty'
  '18': years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. &l4&rAnd if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. &l5&rAnd if it be from five years old even unto twenty
  '19': years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. &l6&rAnd if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy
  '20': estimation shall be three shekels of silver. &l7&rAnd if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. &l8&rBut if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall
  '21': present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him. &l9&rAnd if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the Lord, all that any man giveth of such unto the Lord shall
  '22': 'be holy. &l10&rHe shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or
    a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the
    exchange thereof shall be holy. &l11&rAnd if it be any unclean beast, of which
    they do not offer a'
  '23': 'sacrifice unto the Lord, then he shall present the beast before the priest:
    &l12&rAnd the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest
    it, who art the priest, so shall it be. &l13&rBut if he will at all redeem it,
    then he shall add a'
  '24': 'fifth part thereof unto thy estimation. &l14&rAnd when a man shall sanctify
    his house to be holy unto the Lord, then the priest shall estimate it, whether
    it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand. &l15&rAnd
    if he that'
  '25': sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his. &l16&rAnd if a man shall sanctify unto the Lord some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be
  '26': 'according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at
    fifty shekels of silver. &l17&rIf he sanctify his field from the year of jubile,
    according to thy estimation it shall stand. &l18&rBut if he sanctify his field
    after the jubile, then'
  '27': the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation. &l19&rAnd if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth
  '28': part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him. &l20&rAnd if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. &l21&rBut the field, when it goeth out in the jubile,
  '29': shall be holy unto the Lord, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's. &l22&rAnd if a man sanctify unto the Lord a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession; &l23&rThen the priest shall reckon unto him
  '30': 'the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall
    give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the Lord. &l24&rIn the
    year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even
    to him to whom the'
  '31': 'possession of the land did belong. &l25&rAnd all thy estimations shall be
    according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. &l26&rOnly
    the firstling of the beasts, which should be the Lord''s firstling, no man shall
    sanctify it;'
  '32': 'whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the Lord''s. &l27&rAnd if it be of an unclean
    beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a
    fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according
    to thy'
  '33': 'estimation. &l28&rNotwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote
    unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of
    his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto
    the Lord. &l29&rNone'
  '34': 'devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely
    be put to death. &l30&rAnd all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
    land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord''s: it is holy unto the Lord. &l31&rAnd
    if a man will'
  '35': at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof. &l32&rAnd concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord. &l33&rHe shall not search whether
  '36': 'it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all,
    then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. &l34&rThese
    are the commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel
    in mount'
