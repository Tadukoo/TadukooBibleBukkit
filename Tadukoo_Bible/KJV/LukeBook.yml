  '1': Chapter 1/nForasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, &l2&rEven as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;
  '2': '&l3&rIt seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things
    from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, &l4&rThat
    thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.'
  '3': '&l5&rThere was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest
    named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron,
    and her name was Elisabeth. &l6&rAnd they were both righteous before God, walking
    in all the'
  '4': commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. &l7&rAnd they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years. &l8&rAnd it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of
  '5': his course, &l9&rAccording to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. &l10&rAnd the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. &l11&rAnd there appeared unto
  '6': 'him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
    &l12&rAnd when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. &l13&rBut
    the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy
    wife Elisabeth'
  '7': shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. &l14&rAnd thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. &l15&rFor he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be
  '8': filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. &l16&rAnd many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. &l17&rAnd he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and
  '9': the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. &l18&rAnd Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. &l19&rAnd the angel answering said unto
  '10': him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. &l20&rAnd, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou
  '11': 'believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. &l21&rAnd
    the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the
    temple. &l22&rAnd when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived
    that he had seen'
  '12': 'a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.
    &l23&rAnd it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were
    accomplished, he departed to his own house. &l24&rAnd after those days his wife
    Elisabeth conceived,'
  '13': and hid herself five months, saying, &l25&rThus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men. &l26&rAnd in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
  '14': '&l27&rTo a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
    David; and the virgin''s name was Mary. &l28&rAnd the angel came in unto her,
    and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed
    art thou among women.'
  '15': '&l29&rAnd when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her
    mind what manner of salutation this should be. &l30&rAnd the angel said unto her,
    Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. &l31&rAnd, behold, thou shalt
    conceive in thy'
  '16': 'womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. &l32&rHe shall
    be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give
    unto him the throne of his father David: &l33&rAnd he shall reign over the house
    of Jacob for ever;'
  '17': and of his kingdom there shall be no end. &l34&rThen said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? &l35&rAnd the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
  '18': 'thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be
    called the Son of God. &l36&rAnd, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also
    conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was
    called barren. &l37&rFor'
  '19': with God nothing shall be impossible. &l38&rAnd Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. &l39&rAnd Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of
  '20': 'Juda; &l40&rAnd entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
    &l41&rAnd it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary,
    the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: &l42&rAnd
    she spake out'
  '21': with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. &l43&rAnd whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? &l44&rFor, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the
  '22': 'babe leaped in my womb for joy. &l45&rAnd blessed is she that believed: for
    there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.
    &l46&rAnd Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, &l47&rAnd my spirit hath rejoiced
    in God my'
  '23': 'Saviour. &l48&rFor he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
    behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. &l49&rFor he that
    is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name. &l50&rAnd his mercy
    is on them that'
  '24': fear him from generation to generation. &l51&rHe hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. &l52&rHe hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. &l53&rHe hath filled the
  '25': hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. &l54&rHe hath helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; &l55&rAs he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever. &l56&rAnd Mary abode with her about three months,
  '26': and returned to her own house. &l57&rNow Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. &l58&rAnd her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
  '27': '&l59&rAnd it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise
    the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. &l60&rAnd
    his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. &l61&rAnd they
    said unto her,'
  '28': There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. &l62&rAnd they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. &l63&rAnd he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all. &l64&rAnd his mouth was
  '29': 'opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.
    &l65&rAnd fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings
    were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. &l66&rAnd all they
    that heard them laid'
  '30': them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him. &l67&rAnd his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, &l68&rBlessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited
  '31': 'and redeemed his people, &l69&rAnd hath raised up an horn of salvation for
    us in the house of his servant David; &l70&rAs he spake by the mouth of his holy
    prophets, which have been since the world began: &l71&rThat we should be saved
    from our enemies, and'
  '32': from the hand of all that hate us; &l72&rTo perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; &l73&rThe oath which he sware to our father Abraham, &l74&rThat he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our
  '33': 'enemies might serve him without fear, &l75&rIn holiness and righteousness
    before him, all the days of our life. &l76&rAnd thou, child, shalt be called the
    prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare
    his ways; &l77&rTo'
  '34': give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins, &l78&rThrough the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us, &l79&rTo give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide
  '35': our feet into the way of peace. &l80&rAnd the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.
  '36': Chapter 2/nAnd it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. &l2&r(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) &l3&rAnd all went to be taxed, every one into his
  '37': own city. &l4&rAnd Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) &l5&rTo be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great
  '38': with child. &l6&rAnd so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. &l7&rAnd she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room
  '39': 'for them in the inn. &l8&rAnd there were in the same country shepherds abiding
    in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. &l9&rAnd, lo, the angel
    of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them:
    and they were sore'
  '40': 'afraid. &l10&rAnd the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring
    you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. &l11&rFor unto you
    is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. &l12&rAnd
    this shall be a'
  '41': sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. &l13&rAnd suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, &l14&rGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
  '42': toward men. &l15&rAnd it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. &l16&rAnd
  '43': they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. &l17&rAnd when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. &l18&rAnd all they that heard it wondered at those things which
  '44': were told them by the shepherds. &l19&rBut Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. &l20&rAnd the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. &l21&rAnd when
  '45': eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. &l22&rAnd when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished,
  '46': they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord; &l23&r(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) &l24&rAnd to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the
  '47': 'Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. &l25&rAnd, behold, there
    was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout,
    waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. &l26&rAnd
    it was'
  '48': 'revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before
    he had seen the Lord''s Christ. &l27&rAnd he came by the Spirit into the temple:
    and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom
    of the law, &l28&rThen'
  '49': 'took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, &l29&rLord, now lettest
    thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: &l30&rFor mine eyes have
    seen thy salvation, &l31&rWhich thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
    &l32&rA light'
  '50': to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. &l33&rAnd Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.

  '1': Chapter 2 Cont./n&l34&rAnd Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; &l35&r(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul
  '2': 'also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. &l36&rAnd there was
    one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was
    of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;
    &l37&rAnd she was a'
  '3': widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day. &l38&rAnd she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for
  '4': 'redemption in Jerusalem. &l39&rAnd when they had performed all things according
    to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
    &l40&rAnd the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and
    the grace of God'
  '5': was upon him. &l41&rNow his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. &l42&rAnd when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. &l43&rAnd when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned,
  '6': the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. &l44&rBut they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. &l45&rAnd when they found him
  '7': not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. &l46&rAnd it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. &l47&rAnd all that heard him were
  '8': 'astonished at his understanding and answers. &l48&rAnd when they saw him,
    they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt
    with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. &l49&rAnd he said
    unto them, How is it'
  '9': 'that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father''s business?
    &l50&rAnd they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. &l51&rAnd he
    went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his
    mother kept all these'
  '10': sayings in her heart. &l52&rAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.
  '11': Chapter 3/nNow in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of
  '12': Abilene, &l2&rAnnas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. &l3&rAnd he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; &l4&rAs it is
  '13': written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. &l5&rEvery valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the
  '14': crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; &l6&rAnd all flesh shall see the salvation of God. &l7&rThen said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from
  '15': 'the wrath to come? &l8&rBring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance,
    and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say
    unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
    &l9&rAnd now also the'
  '16': 'axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth
    not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. &l10&rAnd the people
    asked him, saying, What shall we do then? &l11&rHe answereth and saith unto them,
    He that hath two'
  '17': coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. &l12&rThen came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? &l13&rAnd he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed
  '18': you. &l14&rAnd the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages. &l15&rAnd as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in
  '19': 'their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; &l16&rJohn answered,
    saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I
    cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize
    you with the Holy'
  '20': 'Ghost and with fire: &l17&rWhose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly
    purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will
    burn with fire unquenchable. &l18&rAnd many other things in his exhortation preached
    he unto the'
  '21': people. &l19&rBut Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, &l20&rAdded yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison. &l21&rNow when all the people were baptized, it
  '22': came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, &l22&rAnd the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.
  '23': '&l23&rAnd Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as
    was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli, &l24&rWhich was the
    son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which
    was the son of Janna,'
  '24': which was the son of Joseph, &l25&rWhich was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Amos, which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was the son of Nagge, &l26&rWhich was the son of Maath, which was the son of Mattathias, which was

  '26': Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er, &l29&rWhich was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son
  '27': of Levi, &l30&rWhich was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of Eliakim, &l31&rWhich was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which was the son of Mattatha, which
  '28': was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David, &l32&rWhich was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was the son of Naasson, &l33&rWhich was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of
  '29': Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son of Juda, &l34&rWhich was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor, &l35&rWhich was
  '30': the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala, &l36&rWhich was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which
  '31': was the son of Lamech, &l37&rWhich was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the son of Cainan, &l38&rWhich was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son
  '32': of Adam, which was the son of God.
  '33': 'Chapter 4/nAnd Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and
    was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, &l2&rBeing forty days tempted of the
    devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward
    hungered.'
  '34': '&l3&rAnd the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this
    stone that it be made bread. &l4&rAnd Jesus answered him, saying, It is written,
    That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. &l5&rAnd the
    devil, taking him up'
  '35': 'into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a
    moment of time. &l6&rAnd the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee,
    and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will
    I give it. &l7&rIf'
  '36': 'thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. &l8&rAnd Jesus answered
    and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship
    the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. &l9&rAnd he brought him to Jerusalem,
    and set'
  '37': 'him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of
    God, cast thyself down from hence: &l10&rFor it is written, He shall give his
    angels charge over thee, to keep thee: &l11&rAnd in their hands they shall bear
    thee up, lest at any'
  '38': time thou dash thy foot against a stone. &l12&rAnd Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. &l13&rAnd when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season. &l14&rAnd Jesus returned in the
  '39': 'power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through
    all the region round about. &l15&rAnd he taught in their synagogues, being glorified
    of all. &l16&rAnd he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his
    custom was, he'
  '40': went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read. &l17&rAnd there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, &l18&rThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
  '41': because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, &l19&rTo preach the acceptable
  '42': year of the Lord. &l20&rAnd he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. &l21&rAnd he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your
  '43': 'ears. &l22&rAnd all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
    which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph''s son? &l23&rAnd
    he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself:
    whatsoever we'
  '44': have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country. &l24&rAnd he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country. &l25&rBut I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up
  '45': three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land; &l26&rBut unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. &l27&rAnd many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
  '46': prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian. &l28&rAnd all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, &l29&rAnd rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon
  '47': their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong. &l30&rBut he passing through the midst of them went his way, &l31&rAnd came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days. &l32&rAnd they were astonished at his
  '48': 'doctrine: for his word was with power. &l33&rAnd in the synagogue there was
    a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,
    &l34&rSaying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?
    art thou come to'
  '49': destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God. &l35&rAnd Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not. &l36&rAnd they were all amazed, and
  '50': spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out. &l37&rAnd the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.

  '2': immediately she arose and ministered unto them. &l40&rNow when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. &l41&rAnd devils also came out of many,
  '3': 'crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them
    suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ. &l42&rAnd when it
    was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him,
    and came unto him,'
  '4': 'and stayed him, that he should not depart from them. &l43&rAnd he said unto
    them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am
    I sent. &l44&rAnd he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.'
  '5': 'Chapter 5/nAnd it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear
    the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, &l2&rAnd saw two ships standing
    by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
    &l3&rAnd he'
  '6': entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. &l4&rNow when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and
  '7': 'let down your nets for a draught. &l5&rAnd Simon answering said unto him,
    Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at
    thy word I will let down the net. &l6&rAnd when they had this done, they inclosed
    a great multitude of'
  '8': 'fishes: and their net brake. &l7&rAnd they beckoned unto their partners, which
    were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and
    filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. &l8&rWhen Simon Peter saw it,
    he fell down at'
  '9': 'Jesus'' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. &l9&rFor
    he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which
    they had taken: &l10&rAnd so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which
    were partners'
  '10': with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. &l11&rAnd when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him. &l12&rAnd it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of
  '11': 'leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord,
    if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. &l13&rAnd he put forth his hand, and touched
    him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from
    him. &l14&rAnd he'
  '12': 'charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer
    for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. &l15&rBut
    so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together
    to'
  '13': hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. &l16&rAnd he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed. &l17&rAnd it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come
  '14': 'out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of
    the Lord was present to heal them. &l18&rAnd, behold, men brought in a bed a man
    which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay
    him before him.'
  '15': '&l19&rAnd when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because
    of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling
    with his couch into the midst before Jesus. &l20&rAnd when he saw their faith,
    he said unto'
  '16': him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. &l21&rAnd the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? &l22&rBut when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them,
  '17': What reason ye in your hearts? &l23&rWhether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? &l24&rBut that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto
  '18': thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. &l25&rAnd immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. &l26&rAnd they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were
  '19': 'filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day. &l27&rAnd after
    these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt
    of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me. &l28&rAnd he left all, rose up, and
    followed him.'
  '20': '&l29&rAnd Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great
    company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. &l30&rBut their scribes
    and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink
    with publicans'
  '21': and sinners? &l31&rAnd Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. &l32&rI came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. &l33&rAnd they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast
  '22': often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink? &l34&rAnd he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? &l35&rBut the days will come, when the
  '23': bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. &l36&rAnd he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken
  '24': out of the new agreeth not with the old. &l37&rAnd no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. &l38&rBut new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.
  '25': '&l39&rNo man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he
    saith, The old is better.'
  '26': Chapter 6/nAnd it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. &l2&rAnd certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye
  '27': that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days? &l3&rAnd Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; &l4&rHow he went into the house of God, and did take and
  '28': eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone? &l5&rAnd he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. &l6&rAnd it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he
  '29': 'entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand
    was withered. &l7&rAnd the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would
    heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him. &l8&rBut
    he knew their'
  '30': thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth. &l9&rThen said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save
  '31': 'life, or to destroy it? &l10&rAnd looking round about upon them all, he said
    unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored
    whole as the other. &l11&rAnd they were filled with madness; and communed one
    with another what they'
  '32': 'might do to Jesus. &l12&rAnd it came to pass in those days, that he went
    out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. &l13&rAnd
    when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve,
    whom also he named'
  '33': apostles; &l14&rSimon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, &l15&rMatthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes, &l16&rAnd Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot,
  '34': which also was the traitor. &l17&rAnd he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and
  '35': 'to be healed of their diseases; &l18&rAnd they that were vexed with unclean
    spirits: and they were healed. &l19&rAnd the whole multitude sought to touch him:
    for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all. &l20&rAnd he lifted up
    his eyes on his'
  '36': 'disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.
    &l21&rBlessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that
    weep now: for ye shall laugh. &l22&rBlessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and
    when they shall'
  '37': 'separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your
    name as evil, for the Son of man''s sake. &l23&rRejoice ye in that day, and leap
    for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did
    their fathers unto'
  '38': the prophets. &l24&rBut woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. &l25&rWoe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. &l26&rWoe unto you, when all men shall speak well of
  '39': you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets. &l27&rBut I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, &l28&rBless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. &l29&rAnd unto him that smiteth thee
  '40': on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. &l30&rGive to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. &l31&rAnd as ye would that men should do to
  '41': you, do ye also to them likewise. &l32&rFor if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. &l33&rAnd if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.
  '42': '&l34&rAnd if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have
    ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. &l35&rBut love
    ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward
    shall be great, and ye'
  '43': 'shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful
    and to the evil. &l36&rBe ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
    &l37&rJudge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be
    condemned: forgive, and'
  '44': 'ye shall be forgiven: &l38&rGive, and it shall be given unto you; good measure,
    pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your
    bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you
    again. &l39&rAnd'
  '45': 'he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not
    both fall into the ditch? &l40&rThe disciple is not above his master: but every
    one that is perfect shall be as his master. &l41&rAnd why beholdest thou the mote
    that is in thy'
  '46': brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? &l42&rEither how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite,
  '47': cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye. &l43&rFor a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. &l44&rFor every
  '48': tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. &l45&rA good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart
  '49': 'bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his
    mouth speaketh. &l46&rAnd why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which
    I say? &l47&rWhosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I
    will shew you to whom'
  '50': 'he is like: &l48&rHe is like a man which built an house, and digged deep,
    and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently
    upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.'

  '2': Chapter 7/nNow when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum. &l2&rAnd a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. &l3&rAnd when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the
  '3': 'elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.
    &l4&rAnd when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he
    was worthy for whom he should do this: &l5&rFor he loveth our nation, and he hath
    built us a'
  '4': 'synagogue. &l6&rThen Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from
    the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not
    thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: &l7&rWherefore
    neither'
  '5': 'thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant
    shall be healed. &l8&rFor I also am a man set under authority, having under me
    soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh;
    and to my'
  '6': servant, Do this, and he doeth it. &l9&rWhen Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. &l10&rAnd they that were sent,
  '7': returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick. &l11&rAnd it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. &l12&rNow when he came nigh to the gate of the
  '8': 'city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother,
    and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. &l13&rAnd when
    the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. &l14&rAnd
    he came and touched'
  '9': 'the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say
    unto thee, Arise. &l15&rAnd he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he
    delivered him to his mother. &l16&rAnd there came a fear on all: and they glorified
    God, saying,'
  '10': That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. &l17&rAnd this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about. &l18&rAnd the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.
  '11': '&l19&rAnd John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus,
    saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? &l20&rWhen the men
    were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art
    thou he that should'
  '12': come? or look we for another? &l21&rAnd in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight. &l22&rThen Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye
  '13': have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached. &l23&rAnd blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. &l24&rAnd when the messengers of
  '14': John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? &l25&rBut what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously
  '15': apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts. &l26&rBut what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. &l27&rThis is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall
  '16': 'prepare thy way before thee. &l28&rFor I say unto you, Among those that are
    born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that
    is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. &l29&rAnd all the people that
    heard him, and the'
  '17': publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. &l30&rBut the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him. &l31&rAnd the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
  '18': generation? and to what are they like? &l32&rThey are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. &l33&rFor John the
  '19': Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. &l34&rThe Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! &l35&rBut wisdom is justified of
  '20': all her children. &l36&rAnd one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. &l37&rAnd, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the
  '21': Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, &l38&rAnd stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. &l39&rNow
  '22': 'when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying,
    This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman
    this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. &l40&rAnd Jesus answering said
    unto him, Simon, I'
  '23': 'have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. &l41&rThere
    was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence,
    and the other fifty. &l42&rAnd when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave
    them both. Tell me'
  '24': therefore, which of them will love him most? &l43&rSimon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. &l44&rAnd he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered
  '25': 'into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed
    my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. &l45&rThou gavest
    me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my
    feet. &l46&rMy head'
  '26': 'with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with
    ointment. &l47&rWherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven;
    for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. &l48&rAnd
    he said unto'
  '27': her, Thy sins are forgiven. &l49&rAnd they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? &l50&rAnd he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
  '28': 'Chapter 8/nAnd it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city
    and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and
    the twelve were with him, &l2&rAnd certain women, which had been healed of evil
    spirits and'
  '29': infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, &l3&rAnd Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance. &l4&rAnd when much people were gathered together, and were
  '30': 'come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable: &l5&rA sower went out
    to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden
    down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. &l6&rAnd some fell upon a rock; and
    as soon as it was'
  '31': sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. &l7&rAnd some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. &l8&rAnd other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things,
  '32': 'he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. &l9&rAnd his disciples
    asked him, saying, What might this parable be? &l10&rAnd he said, Unto you it
    is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables;
    that seeing they might'
  '33': 'not see, and hearing they might not understand. &l11&rNow the parable is
    this: The seed is the word of God. &l12&rThose by the way side are they that hear;
    then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they
    should believe and be'
  '34': saved. &l13&rThey on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. &l14&rAnd that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard,
  '35': go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. &l15&rBut that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
  '36': ' &l16&rNo man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel,
    or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter
    in may see the light. &l17&rFor nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest;
    neither any thing'
  '37': 'hid, that shall not be known and come abroad. &l18&rTake heed therefore how
    ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from
    him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have. &l19&rThen came to him
    his mother and his'
  '38': brethren, and could not come at him for the press. &l20&rAnd it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. &l21&rAnd he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear
  '39': 'the word of God, and do it. &l22&rNow it came to pass on a certain day, that
    he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over
    unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. &l23&rBut as they sailed
    he fell asleep:'
  '40': 'and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with
    water, and were in jeopardy. &l24&rAnd they came to him, and awoke him, saying,
    Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging
    of the water: and they'
  '41': ceased, and there was a calm. &l25&rAnd he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him. &l26&rAnd they arrived at the
  '42': country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee. &l27&rAnd when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs. &l28&rWhen he saw
  '43': Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not. &l29&r(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes
  '44': 'it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and
    he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.) &l30&rAnd
    Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils
    were entered into'
  '45': 'him. &l31&rAnd they besought him that he would not command them to go out
    into the deep. &l32&rAnd there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the
    mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them.
    And he suffered them.'
  '46': '&l33&rThen went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and
    the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked. &l34&rWhen
    they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city
    and in the'
  '47': 'country. &l35&rThen they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus,
    and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of
    Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. &l36&rThey also which
    saw it told them'
  '48': 'by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed. &l37&rThen
    the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to
    depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the
    ship, and returned back'
  '49': 'again. &l38&rNow the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
    that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, &l39&rReturn to thine
    own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his
    way, and published'

  '1': 'Chapter 8 Cont./n&l41&rAnd, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he
    was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus'' feet, and besought him
    that he would come into his house: &l42&rFor he had one only daughter, about twelve
    years of age, and'
  '2': 'she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him. &l43&rAnd a woman
    having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians,
    neither could be healed of any, &l44&rCame behind him, and touched the border
    of his garment:'
  '3': and immediately her issue of blood stanched. &l45&rAnd Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? &l46&rAnd Jesus said, Somebody
  '4': 'hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. &l47&rAnd when
    the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before
    him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched
    him, and how she'
  '5': 'was healed immediately. &l48&rAnd he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort:
    thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. &l49&rWhile he yet spake, there cometh
    one from the ruler of the synagogue''s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead;
    trouble'
  '6': 'not the Master. &l50&rBut when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear
    not: believe only, and she shall be made whole. &l51&rAnd when he came into the
    house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father
    and the mother'
  '7': 'of the maiden. &l52&rAnd all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not;
    she is not dead, but sleepeth. &l53&rAnd they laughed him to scorn, knowing that
    she was dead. &l54&rAnd he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
    saying, Maid,'
  '8': 'arise. &l55&rAnd her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he
    commanded to give her meat. &l56&rAnd her parents were astonished: but he charged
    them that they should tell no man what was done.'
  '9': Chapter 9/nThen he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. &l2&rAnd he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. &l3&rAnd he said unto them, Take nothing for your
  '10': journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece. &l4&rAnd whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart. &l5&rAnd whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the
  '11': 'very dust from your feet for a testimony against them. &l6&rAnd they departed,
    and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where. &l7&rNow
    Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because
    that it'
  '12': 'was said of some, that John was risen from the dead; &l8&rAnd of some, that
    Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
    &l9&rAnd Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such
    things? And he'
  '13': desired to see him. &l10&rAnd the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida. &l11&rAnd the people, when they knew it, followed
  '14': 'him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and
    healed them that had need of healing. &l12&rAnd when the day began to wear away,
    then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may
    go into the towns and'
  '15': 'country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert
    place. &l13&rBut he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have
    no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all
    this people.'
  '16': '&l14&rFor they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples,
    Make them sit down by fifties in a company. &l15&rAnd they did so, and made them
    all sit down. &l16&rThen he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking
    up to heaven, he'
  '17': 'blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
    &l17&rAnd they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments
    that remained to them twelve baskets. &l18&rAnd it came to pass, as he was alone
    praying, his'
  '18': 'disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that
    I am? &l19&rThey answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others
    say, that one of the old prophets is risen again. &l20&rHe said unto them, But
    whom say ye that'
  '19': I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God. &l21&rAnd he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing; &l22&rSaying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be
  '20': 'slain, and be raised the third day. &l23&rAnd he said to them all, If any
    man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and
    follow me. &l24&rFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever
    will lose his life for'
  '21': my sake, the same shall save it. &l25&rFor what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away? &l26&rFor whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in
  '22': his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels. &l27&rBut I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God. &l28&rAnd it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings,
  '23': he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. &l29&rAnd as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering. &l30&rAnd, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and
  '24': 'Elias: &l31&rWho appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should
    accomplish at Jerusalem. &l32&rBut Peter and they that were with him were heavy
    with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that
    stood with him.'
  '25': '&l33&rAnd it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus,
    Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for
    thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said. &l34&rWhile
    he thus spake,'
  '26': 'there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered
    into the cloud. &l35&rAnd there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is
    my beloved Son: hear him. &l36&rAnd when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone.
    And they kept it'
  '27': close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen. &l37&rAnd it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him. &l38&rAnd, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I
  '28': 'beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child. &l39&rAnd, lo,
    a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth
    again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him. &l40&rAnd I besought thy disciples
    to cast him'
  '29': out; and they could not. &l41&rAnd Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. &l42&rAnd as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked
  '30': the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father. &l43&rAnd they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples, &l44&rLet these sayings
  '31': 'sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the
    hands of men. &l45&rBut they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,
    that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying. &l46&rThen
    there arose a'
  '32': 'reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest. &l47&rAnd Jesus,
    perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him, &l48&rAnd
    said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and
    whosoever shall'
  '33': 'receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all,
    the same shall be great. &l49&rAnd John answered and said, Master, we saw one
    casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with
    us. &l50&rAnd Jesus'
  '34': 'said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us. &l51&rAnd
    it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly
    set his face to go to Jerusalem, &l52&rAnd sent messengers before his face: and
    they'
  '35': went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. &l53&rAnd they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem. &l54&rAnd when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we
  '36': command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? &l55&rBut he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. &l56&rFor the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And
  '37': they went to another village. &l57&rAnd it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. &l58&rAnd Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but
  '38': 'the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. &l59&rAnd he said unto another,
    Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. &l60&rJesus
    said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom
    of God.'
  '39': '&l61&rAnd another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go
    bid them farewell, which are at home at my house. &l62&rAnd Jesus said unto him,
    No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom
    of God.'
  '40': Chapter 10/nAfter these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. &l2&rTherefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are
  '41': 'few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth
    labourers into his harvest. &l3&rGo your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs
    among wolves. &l4&rCarry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man
    by the way. &l5&rAnd'
  '42': 'into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. &l6&rAnd
    if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall
    turn to you again. &l7&rAnd in the same house remain, eating and drinking such
    things as they give:'
  '43': 'for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. &l8&rAnd
    into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set
    before you: &l9&rAnd heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom
    of God is come'
  '44': 'nigh unto you. &l10&rBut into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive
    you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, &l11&rEven the
    very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding
    be ye sure of'
  '45': this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. &l12&rBut I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. &l13&rWoe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre
  '46': and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. &l14&rBut it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you. &l15&rAnd thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven,
  '47': shalt be thrust down to hell. &l16&rHe that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. &l17&rAnd the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto
  '48': 'us through thy name. &l18&rAnd he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning
    fall from heaven. &l19&rBehold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
    scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means
    hurt you.'
  '49': '&l20&rNotwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto
    you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven. &l21&rIn that
    hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven
    and earth, that'
  '50': 'thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them
    unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.'

    man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son,
    and he to whom the Son will reveal him. &l23&rAnd he turned him unto his disciples,

    what shall I do to inherit eternal life? &l26&rHe said unto him, What is written
    in the law? how readest thou? &l27&rAnd he answering said, Thou shalt love the

    himself, said unto'
  '5': Jesus, And who is my neighbour? &l30&rAnd Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. &l31&rAnd by chance there
  '6': 'came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on
    the other side. &l32&rAnd likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and
    looked on him, and passed by on the other side. &l33&rBut a certain Samaritan,
    as he journeyed, came'
  '7': 'where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, &l34&rAnd went
    to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own
    beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. &l35&rAnd on the morrow
    when he departed,'
  '8': he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. &l36&rWhich now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the
  '9': 'thieves? &l37&rAnd he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto
    him, Go, and do thou likewise. &l38&rNow it came to pass, as they went, that he
    entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him
    into her house.'
  '10': '&l39&rAnd she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus'' feet, and
    heard his word. &l40&rBut Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to
    him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?
    bid her therefore'
  '11': 'that she help me. &l41&rAnd Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha,
    thou art careful and troubled about many things: &l42&rBut one thing is needful:
    and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.'
  '12': Chapter 11/nAnd it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. &l2&rAnd he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art
  '13': in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. &l3&rGive us day by day our daily bread. &l4&rAnd forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation;
  '14': but deliver us from evil. &l5&rAnd he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; &l6&rFor a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set
  '15': 'before him? &l7&rAnd he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not:
    the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give
    thee. &l8&rI say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is
    his friend, yet'
  '16': because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. &l9&rAnd I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. &l10&rFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that
  '17': seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. &l11&rIf a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? &l12&rOr if he shall ask an egg, will he
  '18': 'offer him a scorpion? &l13&rIf ye then, being evil, know how to give good
    gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy
    Spirit to them that ask him? &l14&rAnd he was casting out a devil, and it was
    dumb. And it came to'
  '19': pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered. &l15&rBut some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils. &l16&rAnd others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven. &l17&rBut he,
  '20': knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth. &l18&rIf Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out
  '21': devils through Beelzebub. &l19&rAnd if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges. &l20&rBut if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you. &l21&rWhen
  '22': 'a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace: &l22&rBut
    when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from
    him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils. &l23&rHe that
    is not with me is against'
  '23': 'me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth. &l24&rWhen the unclean
    spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and
    finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out. &l25&rAnd
    when he cometh, he'
  '24': 'findeth it swept and garnished. &l26&rThen goeth he, and taketh to him seven
    other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and
    the last state of that man is worse than the first. &l27&rAnd it came to pass,
    as he spake these'
  '25': things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. &l28&rBut he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it. &l29&rAnd when
  '26': 'the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil
    generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign
    of Jonas the prophet. &l30&rFor as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall
    also the Son of man'
  '27': 'be to this generation. &l31&rThe queen of the south shall rise up in the
    judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from
    the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater
    than Solomon is here.'
  '28': ' &l32&rThe men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation,
    and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold,
    a greater than Jonas is here. &l33&rNo man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth
    it in a secret'
  '29': 'place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come
    in may see the light. &l34&rThe light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine
    eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil,
    thy body also is'
  '30': full of darkness. &l35&rTake heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness. &l36&rIf thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee
  '31': 'light. &l37&rAnd as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with
    him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. &l38&rAnd when the Pharisee saw it,
    he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner. &l39&rAnd the Lord said
    unto him, Now do ye'
  '32': Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness. &l40&rYe fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also? &l41&rBut rather give alms of such things as ye
  '33': 'have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you. &l42&rBut woe unto you,
    Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment
    and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
    &l43&rWoe'
  '34': unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets. &l44&rWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.
  '35': '&l45&rThen answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying
    thou reproachest us also. &l46&rAnd he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for
    ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the
    burdens with one'
  '36': 'of your fingers. &l47&rWoe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets,
    and your fathers killed them. &l48&rTruly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds
    of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres. &l49&rTherefore'
  '37': 'also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and
    some of them they shall slay and persecute: &l50&rThat the blood of all the prophets,
    which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
    &l51&rFrom'
  '38': 'the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the
    altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.
    &l52&rWoe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered
    not in'
  '39': 'yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. &l53&rAnd as he said
    these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently,
    and to provoke him to speak of many things: &l54&rLaying wait for him, and seeking
    to catch'
  '40': something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
  '41': Chapter 12/nIn the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
  '42': '&l2&rFor there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid,
    that shall not be known. &l3&rTherefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness
    shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets
    shall be proclaimed'
  '43': 'upon the housetops. &l4&rAnd I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of
    them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. &l5&rBut
    I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath
    power to cast into'
  '44': 'hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. &l6&rAre not five sparrows sold for
    two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? &l7&rBut even the
    very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value
    than many sparrows.'
  '45': '&l8&rAlso I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall
    the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: &l9&rBut he that denieth
    me before men shall be denied before the angels of God. &l10&rAnd whosoever shall
    speak a word against'
  '46': 'the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against
    the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven. &l11&rAnd when they bring you unto the
    synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing
    ye shall'
  '47': 'answer, or what ye shall say: &l12&rFor the Holy Ghost shall teach you in
    the same hour what ye ought to say. &l13&rAnd one of the company said unto him,
    Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. &l14&rAnd
    he said unto him, Man,'
  '48': 'who made me a judge or a divider over you? &l15&rAnd he said unto them, Take
    heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man''s life consisteth not in the abundance
    of the things which he possesseth. &l16&rAnd he spake a parable unto them, saying,
    The ground of'
  '49': 'a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: &l17&rAnd he thought within
    himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
    &l18&rAnd he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater;
    and there will I'
  '50': bestow all my fruits and my goods. &l19&rAnd I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

  '1': 'Chapter 12 Cont./n&l20&rBut God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul
    shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?
    &l21&rSo is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
    &l22&rAnd'
  '2': 'he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for
    your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on. &l23&rThe
    life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment. &l24&rConsider the
    ravens: for they'
  '3': 'neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth
    them: how much more are ye better than the fowls? &l25&rAnd which of you with
    taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? &l26&rIf ye then be not able
    to do that thing which'
  '4': 'is least, why take ye thought for the rest? &l27&rConsider the lilies how
    they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon
    in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. &l28&rIf then God so clothe
    the grass, which is to'
  '5': day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith? &l29&rAnd seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. &l30&rFor all these things do the nations of the
  '6': 'world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
    &l31&rBut rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added
    unto you. &l32&rFear not, little flock; for it is your Father''s good pleasure
    to give you the'
  '7': kingdom. &l33&rSell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. &l34&rFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
  '8': '&l35&rLet your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; &l36&rAnd ye
    yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the
    wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.
    &l37&rBlessed are'
  '9': 'those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I
    say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and
    will come forth and serve them. &l38&rAnd if he shall come in the second watch,
    or come in the third'
  '10': watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants. &l39&rAnd this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through. &l40&rBe ye therefore ready
  '11': 'also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not. &l41&rThen
    Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?
    &l42&rAnd the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his
    lord shall make ruler over'
  '12': his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season? &l43&rBlessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. &l44&rOf a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath. &l45&rBut and if that
  '13': servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; &l46&rThe lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is
  '14': not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. &l47&rAnd that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. &l48&rBut he
  '15': 'that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with
    few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required:
    and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more. &l49&rI am
    come to send fire on'
  '16': 'the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled? &l50&rBut I have a
    baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
    &l51&rSuppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather
    division: &l52&rFor'
  '17': from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. &l53&rThe father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the
  '18': mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. &l54&rAnd he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is. &l55&rAnd when ye see the
  '19': south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass. &l56&rYe hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time? &l57&rYea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
  '20': '&l58&rWhen thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art
    in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale
    thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer
    cast thee into prison.'
  '21': '&l59&rI tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the
    very last mite.'
  '22': Chapter 13/nThere were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. &l2&rAnd Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans,
  '23': 'because they suffered such things? &l3&rI tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent,
    ye shall all likewise perish. &l4&rOr those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam
    fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt
    in Jerusalem?'
  '24': '&l5&rI tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
    &l6&rHe spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard;
    and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. &l7&rThen said he unto the
    dresser of'
  '25': 'his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig
    tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? &l8&rAnd he answering
    said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and
    dung it: &l9&rAnd'
  '26': 'if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.
    &l10&rAnd he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. &l11&rAnd,
    behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and
    was bowed together, and'
  '27': 'could in no wise lift up herself. &l12&rAnd when Jesus saw her, he called
    her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. &l13&rAnd
    he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified
    God. &l14&rAnd'
  '28': 'the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus
    had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in
    which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the
    sabbath day. &l15&rThe'
  '29': Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? &l16&rAnd ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these
  '30': 'eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? &l17&rAnd when
    he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people
    rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him. &l18&rThen said he,
    Unto what is the'
  '31': kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it? &l19&rIt is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it. &l20&rAnd again he
  '32': said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? &l21&rIt is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. &l22&rAnd he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.
  '33': '&l23&rThen said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said
    unto them, &l24&rStrive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you,
    will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. &l25&rWhen once the master of the
    house is risen'
  '34': 'up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock
    at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto
    you, I know you not whence ye are: &l26&rThen shall ye begin to say, We have eaten
    and drunk in thy'
  '35': presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. &l27&rBut he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. &l28&rThere shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and
  '36': Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out. &l29&rAnd they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. &l30&rAnd, behold, there are
  '37': 'last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last. &l31&rThe
    same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and
    depart hence: for Herod will kill thee. &l32&rAnd he said unto them, Go ye, and
    tell that fox,'
  '38': 'Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third
    day I shall be perfected. &l33&rNevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow,
    and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
    &l34&rO Jerusalem,'
  '39': 'Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto
    thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather
    her brood under her wings, and ye would not! &l35&rBehold, your house is left
    unto you desolate:'
  '40': and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
  '41': Chapter 14/nAnd it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. &l2&rAnd, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. &l3&rAnd Jesus answering spake unto
  '42': the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? &l4&rAnd they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; &l5&rAnd answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will
  '43': not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? &l6&rAnd they could not answer him again to these things. &l7&rAnd he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them. &l8&rWhen thou art
  '44': bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; &l9&rAnd he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.
  '45': '&l10&rBut when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that
    when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then
    shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. &l11&rFor
    whosoever'
  '46': exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. &l12&rThen said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest
  '47': 'they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. &l13&rBut when thou
    makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: &l14&rAnd thou
    shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed
    at the resurrection'
  '48': 'of the just. &l15&rAnd when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
    things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of
    God. &l16&rThen said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade
    many: &l17&rAnd sent'
  '49': 'his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all
    things are now ready. &l18&rAnd they all with one consent began to make excuse.
    The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go
    and see it: I pray thee'
  '50': 'have me excused. &l19&rAnd another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen,
    and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. &l20&rAnd another said, I
    have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'

  '1': Chapter 14 Cont./n&l21&rSo that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt,
  '2': and the blind. &l22&rAnd the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. &l23&rAnd the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled. &l24&rFor I
  '3': 'say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.
    &l25&rAnd there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,
    &l26&rIf any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and
    children,'
  '4': and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. &l27&rAnd whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. &l28&rFor which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth
  '5': the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? &l29&rLest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, &l30&rSaying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. &l31&rOr what
  '6': king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? &l32&rOr else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an
  '7': 'ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace. &l33&rSo likewise, whosoever
    he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. &l34&rSalt
    is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
    &l35&rIt is'
  '8': neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
  '9': Chapter 15/nThen drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him. &l2&rAnd the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. &l3&rAnd he spake this parable unto them, saying, &l4&rWhat man of
  '10': you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? &l5&rAnd when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. &l6&rAnd when he cometh
  '11': home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. &l7&rI say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just
  '12': persons, which need no repentance. &l8&rEither what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it? &l9&rAnd when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and
  '13': 'her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece
    which I had lost. &l10&rLikewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence
    of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. &l11&rAnd he said, A certain
    man had two sons:'
  '14': '&l12&rAnd the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion
    of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. &l13&rAnd not
    many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into
    a far country,'
  '15': and there wasted his substance with riotous living. &l14&rAnd when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. &l15&rAnd he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to
  '16': 'feed swine. &l16&rAnd he would fain have filled his belly with the husks
    that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. &l17&rAnd when he came to himself,
    he said, How many hired servants of my father''s have bread enough and to spare,
    and I perish with'
  '17': 'hunger! &l18&rI will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father,
    I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, &l19&rAnd am no more worthy to
    be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. &l20&rAnd he arose, and
    came to his'
  '18': father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. &l21&rAnd the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called
  '19': 'thy son. &l22&rBut the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best
    robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: &l23&rAnd
    bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: &l24&rFor
    this my son'
  '20': 'was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to
    be merry. &l25&rNow his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh
    to the house, he heard musick and dancing. &l26&rAnd he called one of the servants,
    and asked what'
  '21': 'these things meant. &l27&rAnd he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and
    thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and
    sound. &l28&rAnd he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father
    out, and intreated him.'
  '22': '&l29&rAnd he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve
    thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest
    me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: &l30&rBut as soon as this thy
    son was come,'
  '23': 'which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the
    fatted calf. &l31&rAnd he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that
    I have is thine. &l32&rIt was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for
    this thy brother was'
  '24': dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.
  '25': Chapter 16/nAnd he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. &l2&rAnd he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an
  '26': 'account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward. &l3&rThen
    the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from
    me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. &l4&rI am resolved what
    to do, that, when I am'
  '27': put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. &l5&rSo he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? &l6&rAnd he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him,
  '28': Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. &l7&rThen said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. &l8&rAnd the lord commended the unjust
  '29': 'steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in
    their generation wiser than the children of light. &l9&rAnd I say unto you, Make
    to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they
    may receive you'
  '30': 'into everlasting habitations. &l10&rHe that is faithful in that which is
    least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also
    in much. &l11&rIf therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon,
    who will commit to'
  '31': 'your trust the true riches? &l12&rAnd if ye have not been faithful in that
    which is another man''s, who shall give you that which is your own? &l13&rNo servant
    can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or
    else he will hold'
  '32': 'to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. &l14&rAnd
    the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided
    him. &l15&rAnd he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before
    men; but God knoweth'
  '33': 'your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in
    the sight of God. &l16&rThe law and the prophets were until John: since that time
    the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. &l17&rAnd it is
    easier for heaven'
  '34': 'and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. &l18&rWhosoever putteth
    away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth
    her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery. &l19&rThere was a certain
    rich man,'
  '35': 'which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
    &l20&rAnd there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate,
    full of sores, &l21&rAnd desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the
    rich man''s table:'
  '36': 'moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. &l22&rAnd it came to pass, that
    the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham''s bosom: the rich
    man also died, and was buried; &l23&rAnd in hell he lift up his eyes, being in
    torments, and seeth'
  '37': Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. &l24&rAnd he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. &l25&rBut Abraham said, Son,
  '38': 'remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise
    Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. &l26&rAnd
    beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they
    which would pass from'
  '39': 'hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.
    &l27&rThen he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him
    to my father''s house: &l28&rFor I have five brethren; that he may testify unto
    them, lest they'
  '40': 'also come into this place of torment. &l29&rAbraham saith unto him, They
    have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. &l30&rAnd he said, Nay, father
    Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. &l31&rAnd
    he said unto him, If they'
  '41': hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
  '42': 'Chapter 17/nThen said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences
    will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! &l2&rIt were better for him
    that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that
    he should'
  '43': 'offend one of these little ones. &l3&rTake heed to yourselves: If thy brother
    trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. &l4&rAnd if
    he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again
    to thee, saying,'
  '44': I repent; thou shalt forgive him. &l5&rAnd the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. &l6&rAnd the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in
  '45': the sea; and it should obey you. &l7&rBut which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? &l8&rAnd will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup,
  '46': and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? &l9&rDoth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. &l10&rSo likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those
  '47': 'things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have
    done that which was our duty to do. &l11&rAnd it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem,
    that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. &l12&rAnd as he entered
    into a'
  '48': 'certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar
    off: &l13&rAnd they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy
    on us. &l14&rAnd when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto
    the priests. And it came'
  '49': 'to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. &l15&rAnd one of them, when
    he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, &l16&rAnd
    fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
    &l17&rAnd'
  '50': 'Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?
    &l18&rThere are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.
    &l19&rAnd he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.'

  '1': 'Chapter 17 Cont./n&l20&rAnd when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the
    kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh
    not with observation: &l21&rNeither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for,
    behold, the kingdom'
  '2': 'of God is within you. &l22&rAnd he said unto the disciples, The days will
    come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall
    not see it. &l23&rAnd they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after
    them, nor follow'
  '3': them. &l24&rFor as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day. &l25&rBut first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.
  '4': '&l26&rAnd as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of
    the Son of man. &l27&rThey did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were
    given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood
    came, and destroyed them'
  '5': all. &l28&rLikewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; &l29&rBut the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
  '6': '&l30&rEven thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. &l31&rIn
    that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let
    him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise
    not return'
  '7': back. &l32&rRemember Lot's wife. &l33&rWhosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. &l34&rI tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall
  '8': be left. &l35&rTwo women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. &l36&rTwo men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. &l37&rAnd they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them,
  '9': Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.
  '10': 'Chapter 18/nAnd he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
    always to pray, and not to faint; &l2&rSaying, There was in a city a judge, which
    feared not God, neither regarded man: &l3&rAnd there was a widow in that city;
    and she came unto him,'
  '11': 'saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. &l4&rAnd he would not for a while: but
    afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; &l5&rYet
    because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming
    she weary me.'
  '12': '&l6&rAnd the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. &l7&rAnd shall
    not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear
    long with them? &l8&rI tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless
    when the Son of man'
  '13': 'cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? &l9&rAnd he spake this parable
    unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised
    others: &l10&rTwo men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and
    the other a publican.'
  '14': '&l11&rThe Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee,
    that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
    publican. &l12&rI fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
    &l13&rAnd the'
  '15': 'publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven,
    but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. &l14&rI tell
    you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every
    one that'
  '16': 'exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
    &l15&rAnd they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when
    his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. &l16&rBut Jesus called them unto him,
    and said,'
  '17': 'Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such
    is the kingdom of God. &l17&rVerily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive
    the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. &l18&rAnd
    a certain ruler asked'
  '18': him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? &l19&rAnd Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God. &l20&rThou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not
  '19': 'bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother. &l21&rAnd he said,
    All these have I kept from my youth up. &l22&rNow when Jesus heard these things,
    he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute
    unto the poor,'
  '20': 'and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. &l23&rAnd when
    he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. &l24&rAnd when Jesus
    saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches
    enter into the'
  '21': kingdom of God! &l25&rFor it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. &l26&rAnd they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? &l27&rAnd he said, The things which are impossible with men are
  '22': possible with God. &l28&rThen Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee. &l29&rAnd he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,
  '23': '&l30&rWho shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the
    world to come life everlasting. &l31&rThen he took unto him the twelve, and said
    unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
    prophets concerning'
  '24': 'the Son of man shall be accomplished. &l32&rFor he shall be delivered unto
    the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: &l33&rAnd
    they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise
    again. &l34&rAnd'
  '25': 'they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them,
    neither knew they the things which were spoken. &l35&rAnd it came to pass, that
    as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
    &l36&rAnd hearing'
  '26': 'the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. &l37&rAnd they told him, that
    Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. &l38&rAnd he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David,
    have mercy on me. &l39&rAnd they which went before rebuked him, that he should
    hold his peace:'
  '27': 'but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. &l40&rAnd
    Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near,
    he asked him, &l41&rSaying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said,
    Lord, that I'
  '28': 'may receive my sight. &l42&rAnd Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy
    faith hath saved thee. &l43&rAnd immediately he received his sight, and followed
    him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.'
  '29': Chapter 19/nAnd Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. &l2&rAnd, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. &l3&rAnd he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was
  '30': 'little of stature. &l4&rAnd he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore
    tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. &l5&rAnd when Jesus came to the
    place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and
    come down; for to day I'
  '31': 'must abide at thy house. &l6&rAnd he made haste, and came down, and received
    him joyfully. &l7&rAnd when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was
    gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. &l8&rAnd Zacchaeus stood, and said
    unto the Lord:'
  '32': Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. &l9&rAnd Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
  '33': ' &l10&rFor the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
    &l11&rAnd as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he
    was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should
    immediately appear.'
  '34': '&l12&rHe said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive
    for himself a kingdom, and to return. &l13&rAnd he called his ten servants, and
    delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come. &l14&rBut his
    citizens hated'
  '35': him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. &l15&rAnd it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the
  '36': 'money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. &l16&rThen
    came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. &l17&rAnd he said
    unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little,
    have thou'
  '37': authority over ten cities. &l18&rAnd the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. &l19&rAnd he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. &l20&rAnd another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid
  '38': 'up in a napkin: &l21&rFor I feared thee, because thou art an austere man:
    thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.
    &l22&rAnd he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked
    servant. Thou'
  '39': 'knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping
    that I did not sow: &l23&rWherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank,
    that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? &l24&rAnd he said
    unto them that'
  '40': stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. &l25&r(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) &l26&rFor I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath
  '41': shall be taken away from him. &l27&rBut those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. &l28&rAnd when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem. &l29&rAnd it came to pass, when
  '42': 'he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount
    of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, &l30&rSaying, Go ye into the village
    over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon
    yet never man sat:'
  '43': loose him, and bring him hither. &l31&rAnd if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. &l32&rAnd they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. &l33&rAnd as they were
  '44': 'loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?
    &l34&rAnd they said, The Lord hath need of him. &l35&rAnd they brought him to
    Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.
    &l36&rAnd as he went,'
  '45': they spread their clothes in the way. &l37&rAnd when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;
  '46': '&l38&rSaying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace
    in heaven, and glory in the highest. &l39&rAnd some of the Pharisees from among
    the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. &l40&rAnd he answered
    and said unto'
  '47': them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out. &l41&rAnd when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, &l42&rSaying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which
  '48': belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. &l43&rFor the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, &l44&rAnd shall lay thee even with the ground,
  '49': and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. &l45&rAnd he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; &l46&rSaying
  '50': 'unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made
    it a den of thieves. &l47&rAnd he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests
    and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,'

  '2': Chapter 20/nAnd it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders, &l2&rAnd spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest
  '3': 'thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? &l3&rAnd he
    answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: &l4&rThe
    baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? &l5&rAnd they reasoned with themselves,
    saying,'
  '4': 'If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not? &l6&rBut
    and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that
    John was a prophet. &l7&rAnd they answered, that they could not tell whence it
    was. &l8&rAnd'
  '5': Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. &l9&rThen began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time. &l10&rAnd
  '6': 'at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him
    of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.
    &l11&rAnd again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated
    him shamefully,'
  '7': 'and sent him away empty. &l12&rAnd again he sent a third: and they wounded
    him also, and cast him out. &l13&rThen said the lord of the vineyard, What shall
    I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they
    see him. &l14&rBut'
  '8': 'when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This
    is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. &l15&rSo
    they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord
    of the vineyard do'
  '9': unto them? &l16&rHe shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid. &l17&rAnd he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected,
  '10': the same is become the head of the corner? &l18&rWhosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. &l19&rAnd the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and
  '11': 'they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable
    against them. &l20&rAnd they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
    themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might
    deliver him unto'
  '12': 'the power and authority of the governor. &l21&rAnd they asked him, saying,
    Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou
    the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly: &l22&rIs it lawful for us
    to give tribute unto'
  '13': Caesar, or no? &l23&rBut he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me? &l24&rShew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's. &l25&rAnd he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the
  '14': 'things which be Caesar''s, and unto God the things which be God''s. &l26&rAnd
    they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at
    his answer, and held their peace. &l27&rThen came to him certain of the Sadducees,
    which deny that'
  '15': there is any resurrection; and they asked him, &l28&rSaying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. &l29&rThere were
  '16': 'therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.
    &l30&rAnd the second took her to wife, and he died childless. &l31&rAnd the third
    took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.
    &l32&rLast'
  '17': 'of all the woman died also. &l33&rTherefore in the resurrection whose wife
    of them is she? for seven had her to wife. &l34&rAnd Jesus answering said unto
    them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage: &l35&rBut they
    which shall be'
  '18': 'accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead,
    neither marry, nor are given in marriage: &l36&rNeither can they die any more:
    for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children
    of the'
  '19': 'resurrection. &l37&rNow that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the
    bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
    God of Jacob. &l38&rFor he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all
    live unto him.'
  '20': '&l39&rThen certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well
    said. &l40&rAnd after that they durst not ask him any question at all. &l41&rAnd
    he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David''s son? &l42&rAnd David himself
    saith in the book'
  '21': of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, &l43&rTill I make thine enemies thy footstool. &l44&rDavid therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? &l45&rThen in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,
  '22': '&l46&rBeware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love
    greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief
    rooms at feasts; &l47&rWhich devour widows'' houses, and for a shew make long
    prayers: the same shall'
  '23': receive greater damnation.
  '24': Chapter 21/nAnd he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury. &l2&rAnd he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. &l3&rAnd he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they
  '25': 'all: &l4&rFor all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings
    of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had. &l5&rAnd
    as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts,
    he said, &l6&rAs for'
  '26': these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. &l7&rAnd they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these
  '27': 'things shall come to pass? &l8&rAnd he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived:
    for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near:
    go ye not therefore after them. &l9&rBut when ye shall hear of wars and commotions,
    be not'
  '28': 'terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by
    and by. &l10&rThen said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom
    against kingdom: &l11&rAnd great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines,
    and'
  '29': pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. &l12&rBut before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for
  '30': 'my name''s sake. &l13&rAnd it shall turn to you for a testimony. &l14&rSettle
    it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer: &l15&rFor
    I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able
    to gainsay nor'
  '31': resist. &l16&rAnd ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death. &l17&rAnd ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake. &l18&rBut there shall not an hair of your head
  '32': perish. &l19&rIn your patience possess ye your souls. &l20&rAnd when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. &l21&rThen let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the
  '33': midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. &l22&rFor these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. &l23&rBut woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in
  '34': 'those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon
    this people. &l24&rAnd they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be
    led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
    Gentiles, until the times'
  '35': of the Gentiles be fulfilled. &l25&rAnd there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; &l26&rMen's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking
  '36': 'after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven
    shall be shaken. &l27&rAnd then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud
    with power and great glory. &l28&rAnd when these things begin to come to pass,
    then look up, and lift'
  '37': up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. &l29&rAnd he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; &l30&rWhen they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. &l31&rSo likewise ye, when
  '38': 'ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh
    at hand. &l32&rVerily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till
    all be fulfilled. &l33&rHeaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not
    pass away. &l34&rAnd'
  '39': take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. &l35&rFor as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
  '40': ' &l36&rWatch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy
    to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son
    of man. &l37&rAnd in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night
    he went out, and abode'
  '41': in the mount that is called the mount of Olives. &l38&rAnd all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.
  '42': Chapter 22/nNow the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover. &l2&rAnd the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people. &l3&rThen entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
  '43': number of the twelve. &l4&rAnd he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. &l5&rAnd they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. &l6&rAnd he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto
  '44': them in the absence of the multitude. &l7&rThen came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed. &l8&rAnd he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat. &l9&rAnd they said unto him, Where wilt thou that
  '45': we prepare? &l10&rAnd he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. &l11&rAnd ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master
  '46': 'saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover
    with my disciples? &l12&rAnd he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there
    make ready. &l13&rAnd they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they
    made ready the'
  '47': 'passover. &l14&rAnd when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles
    with him. &l15&rAnd he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this
    passover with you before I suffer: &l16&rFor I say unto you, I will not any more
    eat thereof,'
  '48': 'until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. &l17&rAnd he took the cup, and
    gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: &l18&rFor I
    say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of
    God shall come.'
  '49': '&l19&rAnd he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them,
    saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
    &l20&rLikewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament
    in my blood, which is'
  '50': 'shed for you. &l21&rBut, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with
    me on the table. &l22&rAnd truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but
    woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!'

  '1': Chapter 22 Cont./n&l23&rAnd they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. &l24&rAnd there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. &l25&rAnd he said unto them, The kings of the
  '2': 'Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon
    them are called benefactors. &l26&rBut ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest
    among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
    &l27&rFor'
  '3': whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. &l28&rYe are they which have continued with me in my temptations. &l29&rAnd I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father
  '4': 'hath appointed unto me; &l30&rThat ye may eat and drink at my table in my
    kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. &l31&rAnd the
    Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift
    you as wheat:'
  '5': '&l32&rBut I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art
    converted, strengthen thy brethren. &l33&rAnd he said unto him, Lord, I am ready
    to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. &l34&rAnd he said, I tell thee,
    Peter, the cock'
  '6': shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. &l35&rAnd he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. &l36&rThen said he unto them, But now, he that
  '7': 'hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no
    sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. &l37&rFor I say unto you, that this
    that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the
    transgressors: for'
  '8': the things concerning me have an end. &l38&rAnd they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. &l39&rAnd he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. &l40&rAnd when
  '9': 'he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
    &l41&rAnd he was withdrawn from them about a stone''s cast, and kneeled down,
    and prayed, &l42&rSaying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:
    nevertheless not my'
  '10': 'will, but thine, be done. &l43&rAnd there appeared an angel unto him from
    heaven, strengthening him. &l44&rAnd being in an agony he prayed more earnestly:
    and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
    &l45&rAnd when he rose'
  '11': up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, &l46&rAnd said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. &l47&rAnd while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of
  '12': the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. &l48&rBut Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? &l49&rWhen they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with
  '13': the sword? &l50&rAnd one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. &l51&rAnd Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. &l52&rThen Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of
  '14': 'the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against
    a thief, with swords and staves? &l53&rWhen I was daily with you in the temple,
    ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of
    darkness.'
  '15': '&l54&rThen took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest''s
    house. And Peter followed afar off. &l55&rAnd when they had kindled a fire in
    the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
    &l56&rBut a certain'
  '16': maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. &l57&rAnd he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. &l58&rAnd after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter
  '17': 'said, Man, I am not. &l59&rAnd about the space of one hour after another
    confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he
    is a Galilaean. &l60&rAnd Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately,
    while he yet'
  '18': spake, the cock crew. &l61&rAnd the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. &l62&rAnd Peter went out, and wept bitterly. &l63&rAnd the men
  '19': that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him. &l64&rAnd when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? &l65&rAnd many other things blasphemously spake they against him. &l66&rAnd as soon
  '20': 'as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes
    came together, and led him into their council, saying, &l67&rArt thou the Christ?
    tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: &l68&rAnd
    if I also ask you,'
  '21': ye will not answer me, nor let me go. &l69&rHereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. &l70&rThen said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. &l71&rAnd they said, What need we any
  '22': further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
  '23': Chapter 23/nAnd the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. &l2&rAnd they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. &l3&rAnd
  '24': Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. &l4&rThen said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. &l5&rAnd they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the
  '25': people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. &l6&rWhen Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. &l7&rAnd as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who
  '26': 'himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. &l8&rAnd when Herod saw Jesus,
    he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because
    he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by
    him. &l9&rThen he'
  '27': questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. &l10&rAnd the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. &l11&rAnd Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent
  '28': 'him again to Pilate. &l12&rAnd the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends
    together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. &l13&rAnd Pilate,
    when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, &l14&rSaid
    unto them,'
  '29': 'Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and,
    behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching
    those things whereof ye accuse him: &l15&rNo, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to
    him; and, lo,'
  '30': nothing worthy of death is done unto him. &l16&rI will therefore chastise him, and release him. &l17&r(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) &l18&rAnd they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us
  '31': 'Barabbas: &l19&r(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder,
    was cast into prison.) &l20&rPilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake
    again to them. &l21&rBut they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. &l22&rAnd
    he said unto them'
  '32': 'the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death
    in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go. &l23&rAnd they were instant
    with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them
    and of the chief'
  '33': priests prevailed. &l24&rAnd Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. &l25&rAnd he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. &l26&rAnd as they led
  '34': him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. &l27&rAnd there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
  '35': '&l28&rBut Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not
    for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. &l29&rFor, behold, the
    days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the
    wombs that never bare, and'
  '36': the paps which never gave suck. &l30&rThen shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. &l31&rFor if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? &l32&rAnd there were also two other, malefactors,
  '37': led with him to be put to death. &l33&rAnd when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. &l34&rThen said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they
  '38': know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. &l35&rAnd the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. &l36&rAnd the soldiers
  '39': also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, &l37&rAnd saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. &l38&rAnd a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, This Is The King Of The Jews.
  '40': '&l39&rAnd one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying,
    If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. &l40&rBut the other answering rebuked
    him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
    &l41&rAnd we indeed'
  '41': 'justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done
    nothing amiss. &l42&rAnd he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest
    into thy kingdom. &l43&rAnd Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today
    shalt thou be with me'
  '42': in paradise. &l44&rAnd it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. &l45&rAnd the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. &l46&rAnd when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he
  '43': 'said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he
    gave up the ghost. &l47&rNow when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified
    God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. &l48&rAnd all the people that
    came together to that'
  '44': sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. &l49&rAnd all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. &l50&rAnd, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a
  '45': 'counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just: &l51&r(The same had not consented
    to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who
    also himself waited for the kingdom of God. &l52&rThis man went unto Pilate, and
    begged the'
  '46': body of Jesus. &l53&rAnd he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. &l54&rAnd that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. &l55&rAnd the women also, which came
  '47': with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. &l56&rAnd they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
  '48': Chapter 24/nNow upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. &l2&rAnd they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. &l3&rAnd they
  '49': 'entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. &l4&rAnd it came to
    pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in
    shining garments: &l5&rAnd as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to
    the earth, they said unto'
  '50': 'them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? &l6&rHe is not here, but is
    risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,'

  '1': Chapter 24 Cont./n&l7&rSaying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. &l8&rAnd they remembered his words, &l9&rAnd returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the
  '2': eleven, and to all the rest. &l10&rIt was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. &l11&rAnd their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them
  '3': not. &l12&rThen arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. &l13&rAnd, behold, two of them went that same day to a village
  '4': called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. &l14&rAnd they talked together of all these things which had happened. &l15&rAnd it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with
  '5': them. &l16&rBut their eyes were holden that they should not know him. &l17&rAnd he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? &l18&rAnd the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering
  '6': said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? &l19&rAnd he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in
  '7': 'deed and word before God and all the people: &l20&rAnd how the chief priests
    and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
    &l21&rBut we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and
    beside all this, to'
  '8': day is the third day since these things were done. &l22&rYea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; &l23&rAnd when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of
  '9': 'angels, which said that he was alive. &l24&rAnd certain of them which were
    with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but
    him they saw not. &l25&rThen he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to
    believe all that the'
  '10': 'prophets have spoken: &l26&rOught not Christ to have suffered these things,
    and to enter into his glory? &l27&rAnd beginning at Moses and all the prophets,
    he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. &l28&rAnd
    they drew nigh'
  '11': 'unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have
    gone further. &l29&rBut they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
    toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. &l30&rAnd
    it came to pass,'
  '12': as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. &l31&rAnd their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. &l32&rAnd they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he
  '13': talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? &l33&rAnd they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, &l34&rSaying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath
  '14': appeared to Simon. &l35&rAnd they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. &l36&rAnd as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. &l37&rBut they were
  '15': 'terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. &l38&rAnd
    he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
    &l39&rBehold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for
    a spirit hath'
  '16': not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. &l40&rAnd when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. &l41&rAnd while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? &l42&rAnd they gave him a piece of a
  '17': broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. &l43&rAnd he took it, and did eat before them. &l44&rAnd he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses,
  '18': and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. &l45&rThen opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, &l46&rAnd said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the
  '19': 'third day: &l47&rAnd that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
    in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. &l48&rAnd ye are witnesses
    of these things. &l49&rAnd, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you:
    but tarry ye in'
  '20': the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. &l50&rAnd he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. &l51&rAnd it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into
  '21': 'heaven. &l52&rAnd they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
    joy: &l53&rAnd were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.'
