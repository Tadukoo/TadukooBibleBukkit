  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. &l2&rI have loved you,
    saith the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob''s
    brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob, &l3&rAnd I hated Esau, and laid his
    mountains'
  '2': and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. &l4&rWhereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The
  '3': 'border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath indignation
    for ever. &l5&rAnd your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The Lord will be magnified
    from the border of Israel. &l6&rA son honoureth his father, and a servant his
    master: if then'
  '4': I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? &l7&rYe offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein
  '5': have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. &l8&rAnd if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or
  '6': 'accept thy person? saith the Lord of hosts. &l9&rAnd now, I pray you, beseech
    God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard
    your persons? saith the Lord of hosts. &l10&rWho is there even among you that
    would shut the'
  '7': doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. &l11&rFor from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name
  '8': 'shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered
    unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen,
    saith the Lord of hosts. &l12&rBut ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table
    of the Lord is'
  '9': polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible. &l13&rYe said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the Lord of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an
  '10': 'offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the Lord. &l14&rBut cursed
    be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto
    the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and
    my name is'
  '11': dreadful among the heathen.
  '12': 'Chapter 2

    And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you. &l2&rIf ye will not hear,
    and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord
    of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings:
    yea, I have'
  '13': cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart. &l3&rBehold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it. &l4&rAnd ye shall know that I have sent this
  '14': commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord of hosts. &l5&rMy covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name. &l6&rThe law of truth was in his
  '15': 'mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace
    and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity. &l7&rFor the priest''s lips
    should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the
    messenger of the Lord of'
  '16': hosts. &l8&rBut ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts. &l9&rTherefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye
  '17': have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law. &l10&rHave we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers? &l11&rJudah hath dealt
  '18': treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the Lord which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god. &l12&rThe Lord will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and
  '19': the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the Lord of hosts. &l13&rAnd this have ye done again, covering the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the
  '20': 'offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand. &l14&rYet
    ye say, Wherefore? Because the Lord hath been witness between thee and the wife
    of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion,
    and the wife of'
  '21': thy covenant. &l15&rAnd did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. &l16&rFor the Lord,
  '22': 'the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for one covereth violence
    with his garment, saith the Lord of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit,
    that ye deal not treacherously. &l17&rYe have wearied the Lord with your words.
    Yet ye say,'
  '23': Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?
  '24': 'Chapter 3

    Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and
    the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger
    of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of
    hosts.'
  '25': '&l2&rBut who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he
    appeareth? for he is like a refiner''s fire, and like fullers'' soap: &l3&rAnd
    he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons
    of Levi, and purge them as'
  '26': gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. &l4&rThen shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years. &l5&rAnd I will come near to you to judgment; and
  '27': I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not
  '28': me, saith the Lord of hosts. &l6&rFor I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. &l7&rEven from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto
  '29': 'you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return? &l8&rWill
    a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee?
    In tithes and offerings. &l9&rYe are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me,
    even this whole'
  '30': nation. &l10&rBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room
  '31': enough to receive it. &l11&rAnd I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. &l12&rAnd all nations shall call
  '32': 'you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.
    &l13&rYour words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, What
    have we spoken so much against thee? &l14&rYe have said, It is vain to serve God:
    and what profit is it'
  '33': that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts? &l15&rAnd now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered. &l16&rThen they that feared the
  '34': 'Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and
    a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and
    that thought upon his name. &l17&rAnd they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts,
    in that day when I'
  '35': make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. &l18&rThen shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.
  '36': 'Chapter 4

    For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea,
    and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn
    them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.'
  '37': '&l2&rBut unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise
    with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the
    stall. &l3&rAnd ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under
    the soles of your feet in'
  '38': the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts. &l4&rRemember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments. &l5&rBehold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of
  '39': 'the great and dreadful day of the Lord: &l6&rAnd he shall turn the heart
    of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers,
    lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.'
