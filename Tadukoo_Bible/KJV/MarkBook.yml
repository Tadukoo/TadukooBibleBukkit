  '1': Chapter 1/nThe beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; &l2&rAs it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. &l3&rThe voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye
  '2': the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. &l4&rJohn did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. &l5&rAnd there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of
  '3': him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. &l6&rAnd John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; &l7&rAnd preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the
  '4': 'latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. &l8&rI indeed
    have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. &l9&rAnd
    it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was
    baptized'
  '5': 'of John in Jordan. &l10&rAnd straightway coming up out of the water, he saw
    the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: &l11&rAnd
    there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am
    well pleased. &l12&rAnd'
  '6': immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness. &l13&rAnd he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. &l14&rNow after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
  '7': 'Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, &l15&rAnd saying, The
    time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the
    gospel. &l16&rNow as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew
    his brother casting a'
  '8': 'net into the sea: for they were fishers. &l17&rAnd Jesus said unto them, Come
    ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. &l18&rAnd straightway
    they forsook their nets, and followed him. &l19&rAnd when he had gone a little
    farther thence, he'
  '9': 'saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship
    mending their nets. &l20&rAnd straightway he called them: and they left their
    father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. &l21&rAnd
    they went into'
  '10': 'Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue,
    and taught. &l22&rAnd they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them
    as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. &l23&rAnd there was in their
    synagogue a man with'
  '11': an unclean spirit; and he cried out, &l24&rSaying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. &l25&rAnd Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come
  '12': out of him. &l26&rAnd when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. &l27&rAnd they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with
  '13': authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. &l28&rAnd immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee. &l29&rAnd forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house
  '14': of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. &l30&rBut Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. &l31&rAnd he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
  '15': '&l32&rAnd at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were
    diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. &l33&rAnd all the city was
    gathered together at the door. &l34&rAnd he healed many that were sick of divers
    diseases, and cast'
  '16': out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. &l35&rAnd in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. &l36&rAnd Simon and they that were with him
  '17': 'followed after him. &l37&rAnd when they had found him, they said unto him,
    All men seek for thee. &l38&rAnd he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns,
    that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. &l39&rAnd he preached
    in their'
  '18': synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. &l40&rAnd there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. &l41&rAnd Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand,
  '19': and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean. &l42&rAnd as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. &l43&rAnd he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; &l44&rAnd saith unto him, See
  '20': 'thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest,
    and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony
    unto them. &l45&rBut he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad
    the matter,'
  '21': 'insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without
    in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.'
  '22': 'Chapter 2/nAnd again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was
    noised that he was in the house. &l2&rAnd straightway many were gathered together,
    insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the
    door: and he'
  '23': 'preached the word unto them. &l3&rAnd they come unto him, bringing one sick
    of the palsy, which was borne of four. &l4&rAnd when they could not come nigh
    unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had
    broken it up, they let'
  '24': down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. &l5&rWhen Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. &l6&rBut there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, &l7&rWhy doth this
  '25': man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? &l8&rAnd immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? &l9&rWhether is it easier to say
  '26': to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? &l10&rBut that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) &l11&rI say unto thee, Arise, and
  '27': take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house. &l12&rAnd immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. &l13&rAnd he went forth again
  '28': by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them. &l14&rAnd as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him. &l15&rAnd it came to
  '29': 'pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners
    sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they
    followed him. &l16&rAnd when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans
    and sinners, they said'
  '30': 'unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans
    and sinners? &l17&rWhen Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole
    have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the
    righteous, but sinners to'
  '31': 'repentance. &l18&rAnd the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to
    fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the
    Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? &l19&rAnd Jesus said unto them, Can
    the children of the'
  '32': bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. &l20&rBut the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. &l21&rNo man
  '33': 'also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that
    filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse. &l22&rAnd no
    man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles,
    and the wine is'
  '34': 'spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new
    bottles. &l23&rAnd it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the
    sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
    &l24&rAnd the'
  '35': Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? &l25&rAnd he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? &l26&rHow he went into the
  '36': house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? &l27&rAnd he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
  '37': 'sabbath: &l28&rTherefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.'
  '38': Chapter 3/nAnd he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand. &l2&rAnd they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him. &l3&rAnd he saith unto the man which had the
  '39': withered hand, Stand forth. &l4&rAnd he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace. &l5&rAnd when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the
  '40': 'hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand.
    And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other. &l6&rAnd
    the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against
    him, how they might'
  '41': 'destroy him. &l7&rBut Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea:
    and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea, &l8&rAnd from
    Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon,
    a great'
  '42': multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him. &l9&rAnd he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. &l10&rFor he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed
  '43': upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues. &l11&rAnd unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. &l12&rAnd he straitly charged them that they should not make him known. &l13&rAnd he goeth up
  '44': 'into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.
    &l14&rAnd he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might
    send them forth to preach, &l15&rAnd to have power to heal sicknesses, and to
    cast out devils:'
  '45': '&l16&rAnd Simon he surnamed Peter; &l17&rAnd James the son of Zebedee, and
    John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons
    of thunder: &l18&rAnd Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas,
    and James the son'
  '46': 'of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite, &l19&rAnd Judas Iscariot,
    which also betrayed him: and they went into an house. &l20&rAnd the multitude
    cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. &l21&rAnd
    when his friends'
  '47': 'heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside
    himself. &l22&rAnd the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub,
    and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils. &l23&rAnd he called them
    unto him, and'
  '48': said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? &l24&rAnd if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. &l25&rAnd if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. &l26&rAnd if Satan rise up against himself, and
  '49': be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. &l27&rNo man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house. &l28&rVerily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto
  '50': 'the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: &l29&rBut
    he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is
    in danger of eternal damnation. &l30&rBecause they said, He hath an unclean spirit.'

  '1': Chapter 3 Cont./n&l31&rThere came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him. &l32&rAnd the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. &l33&rAnd he
  '2': answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren? &l34&rAnd he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! &l35&rFor whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and
  '3': mother.
  '4': 'Chapter 4/nAnd he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered
    unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea;
    and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. &l2&rAnd he taught them many
    things by'
  '5': 'parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, &l3&rHearken; Behold, there
    went out a sower to sow: &l4&rAnd it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the
    way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. &l5&rAnd some fell
    on stony ground, where'
  '6': 'it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth
    of earth: &l6&rBut when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no
    root, it withered away. &l7&rAnd some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up,
    and choked it, and'
  '7': it yielded no fruit. &l8&rAnd other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred. &l9&rAnd he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. &l10&rAnd
  '8': 'when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the
    parable. &l11&rAnd he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery
    of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done
    in parables:'
  '9': '&l12&rThat seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear,
    and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins
    should be forgiven them. &l13&rAnd he said unto them, Know ye not this parable?
    and how then will ye'
  '10': know all parables? &l14&rThe sower soweth the word. &l15&rAnd these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. &l16&rAnd these are they
  '11': 'likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word,
    immediately receive it with gladness; &l17&rAnd have no root in themselves, and
    so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for
    the word''s sake,'
  '12': immediately they are offended. &l18&rAnd these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, &l19&rAnd the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh
  '13': unfruitful. &l20&rAnd these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred. &l21&rAnd he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel,
  '14': or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? &l22&rFor there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. &l23&rIf any man have ears to hear, let him hear. &l24&rAnd he said unto
  '15': 'them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured
    to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given. &l25&rFor he that hath, to
    him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which
    he hath.'
  '16': '&l26&rAnd he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed
    into the ground; &l27&rAnd should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed
    should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. &l28&rFor the earth bringeth forth
    fruit of herself;'
  '17': first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. &l29&rBut when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. &l30&rAnd he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what
  '18': 'comparison shall we compare it? &l31&rIt is like a grain of mustard seed,
    which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the
    earth: &l32&rBut when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all
    herbs, and shooteth out'
  '19': 'great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of
    it. &l33&rAnd with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were
    able to hear it. &l34&rBut without a parable spake he not unto them: and when
    they were alone, he'
  '20': expounded all things to his disciples. &l35&rAnd the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. &l36&rAnd when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also
  '21': 'with him other little ships. &l37&rAnd there arose a great storm of wind,
    and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. &l38&rAnd he was in
    the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto
    him, Master, carest'
  '22': thou not that we perish? &l39&rAnd he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. &l40&rAnd he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? &l41&rAnd they
  '23': feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
  '24': Chapter 5/nAnd they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. &l2&rAnd when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, &l3&rWho had his dwelling among the tombs;
  '25': 'and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: &l4&rBecause that he had
    been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder
    by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. &l5&rAnd
    always, night and'
  '26': day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. &l6&rBut when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, &l7&rAnd cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most
  '27': 'high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. &l8&rFor he said
    unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. &l9&rAnd he asked him, What
    is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. &l10&rAnd
    he besought him'
  '28': much that he would not send them away out of the country. &l11&rNow there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. &l12&rAnd all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. &l13&rAnd
  '29': 'forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered
    into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they
    were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. &l14&rAnd they that fed
    the swine fled,'
  '30': 'and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what
    it was that was done. &l15&rAnd they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed
    with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind:
    and they were'
  '31': afraid. &l16&rAnd they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine. &l17&rAnd they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. &l18&rAnd when he was come into the ship, he that had been
  '32': possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him. &l19&rHowbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee. &l20&rAnd he
  '33': 'departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done
    for him: and all men did marvel. &l21&rAnd when Jesus was passed over again by
    ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto
    the sea. &l22&rAnd,'
  '34': 'behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name;
    and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, &l23&rAnd besought him greatly, saying,
    My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy
    hands on her, that she'
  '35': may be healed; and she shall live. &l24&rAnd Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him. &l25&rAnd a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, &l26&rAnd had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all
  '36': that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, &l27&rWhen she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. &l28&rFor she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. &l29&rAnd straightway the fountain of
  '37': her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. &l30&rAnd Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes? &l31&rAnd his disciples
  '38': said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? &l32&rAnd he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. &l33&rBut the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before
  '39': him, and told him all the truth. &l34&rAnd he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague. &l35&rWhile he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is
  '40': 'dead: why troublest thou the Master any further? &l36&rAs soon as Jesus heard
    the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid,
    only believe. &l37&rAnd he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James,
    and John the'
  '41': brother of James. &l38&rAnd he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. &l39&rAnd when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but
  '42': sleepeth. &l40&rAnd they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. &l41&rAnd he took the damsel by the hand, and said
  '43': unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise. &l42&rAnd straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. &l43&rAnd he charged them
  '44': straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
  '45': 'Chapter 6/nAnd he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and
    his disciples follow him. &l2&rAnd when the sabbath day was come, he began to
    teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence
    hath this man these'
  '46': things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? &l3&rIs not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?
  '47': And they were offended at him. &l4&rBut Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. &l5&rAnd he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick
  '48': folk, and healed them. &l6&rAnd he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching. &l7&rAnd he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; &l8&rAnd
  '49': 'commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff
    only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse: &l9&rBut be shod with sandals;
    and not put on two coats. &l10&rAnd he said unto them, In what place soever ye
    enter into an'
  '50': house, there abide till ye depart from that place.

  '2': judgment, than for that city. &l12&rAnd they went out, and preached that men should repent. &l13&rAnd they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them. &l14&rAnd king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread
  '3': abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. &l15&rOthers said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. &l16&rBut when Herod
  '4': 'heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the
    dead. &l17&rFor Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound
    him in prison for Herodias'' sake, his brother Philip''s wife: for he had married
    her. &l18&rFor John'
  '5': 'had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother''s wife.
    &l19&rTherefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him;
    but she could not: &l20&rFor Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man
    and an holy, and'
  '6': observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. &l21&rAnd when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee; &l22&rAnd when the daughter of the
  '7': said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. &l23&rAnd he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto
  '8': the half of my kingdom. &l24&rAnd she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. &l25&rAnd she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a
  '9': charger the head of John the Baptist. &l26&rAnd the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. &l27&rAnd immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be
  '10': 'brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, &l28&rAnd brought his
    head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
    &l29&rAnd when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and
    laid it in a'
  '11': 'tomb. &l30&rAnd the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and
    told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught. &l31&rAnd
    he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while:
    for there were'
  '12': many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. &l32&rAnd they departed into a desert place by ship privately. &l33&rAnd the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came
  '13': 'together unto him. &l34&rAnd Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and
    was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a
    shepherd: and he began to teach them many things. &l35&rAnd when the day was now
    far spent, his'
  '14': 'disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time
    is far passed: &l36&rSend them away, that they may go into the country round about,
    and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
    &l37&rHe answered'
  '15': and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat? &l38&rHe saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
  '16': '&l39&rAnd he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green
    grass. &l40&rAnd they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. &l41&rAnd
    when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven,
    and blessed, and'
  '17': brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all. &l42&rAnd they did all eat, and were filled. &l43&rAnd they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes. &l44&rAnd they
  '18': that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men. &l45&rAnd straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. &l46&rAnd when he had sent them away, he
  '19': 'departed into a mountain to pray. &l47&rAnd when even was come, the ship
    was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. &l48&rAnd he saw them toiling
    in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of
    the night he cometh'
  '20': 'unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them. &l49&rBut
    when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and
    cried out: &l50&rFor they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked
    with them, and'
  '21': 'saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid. &l51&rAnd he went
    up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in
    themselves beyond measure, and wondered. &l52&rFor they considered not the miracle
    of the loaves: for'
  '22': their heart was hardened. &l53&rAnd when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore. &l54&rAnd when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him, &l55&rAnd ran through that whole region round about, and
  '23': began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. &l56&rAnd whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his
  '24': 'garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.'
  '25': Chapter 7/nThen came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. &l2&rAnd when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. &l3&rFor the
  '26': Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. &l4&rAnd when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the
  '27': washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. &l5&rThen the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? &l6&rHe answered and said unto them, Well hath
  '28': Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. &l7&rHowbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. &l8&rFor laying aside the commandment
  '29': 'of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and
    many other such like things ye do. &l9&rAnd he said unto them, Full well ye reject
    the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. &l10&rFor Moses said,
    Honour thy'
  '30': 'father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the
    death: &l11&rBut ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban,
    that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall
    be free.'
  '31': '&l12&rAnd ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
    &l13&rMaking the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have
    delivered: and many such like things do ye. &l14&rAnd when he had called all the
    people unto him, he'
  '32': 'said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: &l15&rThere
    is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the
    things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. &l16&rIf any
    man have ears to'
  '33': hear, let him hear. &l17&rAnd when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. &l18&rAnd he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without
  '34': entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; &l19&rBecause it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? &l20&rAnd he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. &l21&rFor from
  '35': 'within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications,
    murders, &l22&rThefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil
    eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: &l23&rAll these evil things come from within,
    and defile'
  '36': 'the man. &l24&rAnd from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre
    and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could
    not be hid. &l25&rFor a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,
    heard of him,'
  '37': 'and came and fell at his feet: &l26&rThe woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician
    by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her
    daughter. &l27&rBut Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for
    it is not meet to take'
  '38': 'the children''s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs. &l28&rAnd she answered
    and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children''s
    crumbs. &l29&rAnd he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone
    out of thy'
  '39': daughter. &l30&rAnd when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed. &l31&rAnd again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of
  '40': Decapolis. &l32&rAnd they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. &l33&rAnd he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his
  '41': tongue; &l34&rAnd looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. &l35&rAnd straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. &l36&rAnd he charged them that they should tell
  '42': 'no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they
    published it; &l37&rAnd were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all
    things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.'
  '43': 'Chapter 8/nIn those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing
    to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, &l2&rI have
    compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and
    have nothing to eat:'
  '44': '&l3&rAnd if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint
    by the way: for divers of them came from far. &l4&rAnd his disciples answered
    him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?
    &l5&rAnd he asked them,'
  '45': 'How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. &l6&rAnd he commanded the
    people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks,
    and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them
    before the people.'
  '46': '&l7&rAnd they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set
    them also before them. &l8&rSo they did eat, and were filled: and they took up
    of the broken meat that was left seven baskets. &l9&rAnd they that had eaten were
    about four thousand:'
  '47': and he sent them away. &l10&rAnd straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha. &l11&rAnd the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. &l12&rAnd he
  '48': sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation. &l13&rAnd he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side. &l14&rNow the
  '49': disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf. &l15&rAnd he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod. &l16&rAnd they reasoned among themselves,
  '50': saying, It is because we have no bread. &l17&rAnd when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?

  '1': Chapter 8 Cont./n&l18&rHaving eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember? &l19&rWhen I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve. &l20&rAnd when the seven
  '2': among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. &l21&rAnd he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand? &l22&rAnd he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch
  '3': him. &l23&rAnd he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought. &l24&rAnd he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. &l25&rAfter that he
  '4': 'put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored,
    and saw every man clearly. &l26&rAnd he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither
    go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town. &l27&rAnd Jesus went out, and
    his disciples,'
  '5': 'into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples,
    saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am? &l28&rAnd they answered, John the
    Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets. &l29&rAnd he saith
    unto them, But whom'
  '6': say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. &l30&rAnd he charged them that they should tell no man of him. &l31&rAnd he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and
  '7': of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. &l32&rAnd he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. &l33&rBut when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying,
  '8': 'Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God,
    but the things that be of men. &l34&rAnd when he had called the people unto him
    with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let
    him deny himself, and'
  '9': take up his cross, and follow me. &l35&rFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. &l36&rFor what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose
  '10': his own soul? &l37&rOr what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? &l38&rWhosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of
  '11': his Father with the holy angels.
  '12': Chapter 9/nAnd he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power. &l2&rAnd after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and
  '13': 'John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and
    he was transfigured before them. &l3&rAnd his raiment became shining, exceeding
    white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them. &l4&rAnd there appeared
    unto them Elias with'
  '14': 'Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. &l5&rAnd Peter answered and said
    to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles;
    one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. &l6&rFor he wist not what
    to say; for they were'
  '15': 'sore afraid. &l7&rAnd there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice
    came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. &l8&rAnd suddenly,
    when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with
    themselves.'
  '16': '&l9&rAnd as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should
    tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the
    dead. &l10&rAnd they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another
    what the'
  '17': rising from the dead should mean. &l11&rAnd they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come? &l12&rAnd he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he
  '18': must suffer many things, and be set at nought. &l13&rBut I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him. &l14&rAnd when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them,
  '19': and the scribes questioning with them. &l15&rAnd straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him. &l16&rAnd he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? &l17&rAnd one of the multitude answered and
  '20': 'said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;
    &l18&rAnd wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth
    with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should
    cast him out; and they'
  '21': 'could not. &l19&rHe answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how
    long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me. &l20&rAnd
    they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him;
    and he fell on'
  '22': 'the ground, and wallowed foaming. &l21&rAnd he asked his father, How long
    is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child. &l22&rAnd ofttimes
    it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou
    canst do any thing,'
  '23': have compassion on us, and help us. &l23&rJesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. &l24&rAnd straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
  '24': '&l25&rWhen Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the
    foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out
    of him, and enter no more into him. &l26&rAnd the spirit cried, and rent him sore,
    and came out of'
  '25': 'him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead. &l27&rBut
    Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose. &l28&rAnd when he
    was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast
    him out? &l29&rAnd'
  '26': he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting. &l30&rAnd they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it. &l31&rFor he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of
  '27': 'man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after
    that he is killed, he shall rise the third day. &l32&rBut they understood not
    that saying, and were afraid to ask him. &l33&rAnd he came to Capernaum: and being
    in the house he'
  '28': 'asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way? &l34&rBut
    they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who
    should be the greatest. &l35&rAnd he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith
    unto them, If any'
  '29': 'man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.
    &l36&rAnd he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken
    him in his arms, he said unto them, &l37&rWhosoever shall receive one of such
    children in my name,'
  '30': 'receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that
    sent me. &l38&rAnd John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils
    in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth
    not us. &l39&rBut'
  '31': 'Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle
    in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. &l40&rFor he that is not against
    us is on our part. &l41&rFor whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink
    in my name, because ye'
  '32': belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. &l42&rAnd whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. &l43&rAnd
  '33': 'if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into
    life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall
    be quenched: &l44&rWhere their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. &l45&rAnd
    if thy foot'
  '34': 'offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than
    having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
    &l46&rWhere their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. &l47&rAnd if thine
    eye offend'
  '35': 'thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God
    with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: &l48&rWhere their
    worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. &l49&rFor every one shall be salted
    with fire, and'
  '36': 'every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. &l50&rSalt is good: but if the
    salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves,
    and have peace one with another.'
  '37': 'Chapter 10/nAnd he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea
    by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he
    was wont, he taught them again. &l2&rAnd the Pharisees came to him, and asked
    him, Is it lawful for a'
  '38': man to put away his wife? tempting him. &l3&rAnd he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you? &l4&rAnd they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. &l5&rAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, For the
  '39': 'hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. &l6&rBut from the beginning
    of the creation God made them male and female. &l7&rFor this cause shall a man
    leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; &l8&rAnd they twain shall
    be one flesh: so'
  '40': then they are no more twain, but one flesh. &l9&rWhat therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. &l10&rAnd in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter. &l11&rAnd he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
  '41': 'marry another, committeth adultery against her. &l12&rAnd if a woman shall
    put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery. &l13&rAnd
    they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples
    rebuked those'
  '42': 'that brought them. &l14&rBut when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and
    said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not:
    for of such is the kingdom of God. &l15&rVerily I say unto you, Whosoever shall
    not receive the'
  '43': kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. &l16&rAnd he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. &l17&rAnd when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good
  '44': Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? &l18&rAnd Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God. &l19&rThou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear
  '45': 'false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. &l20&rAnd he answered
    and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. &l21&rThen
    Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy
    way, sell'
  '46': 'whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
    in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me. &l22&rAnd he was sad at
    that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions. &l23&rAnd Jesus
    looked round about,'
  '47': and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! &l24&rAnd the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches
  '48': to enter into the kingdom of God! &l25&rIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. &l26&rAnd they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
  '49': '&l27&rAnd Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not
    with God: for with God all things are possible. &l28&rThen Peter began to say
    unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. &l29&rAnd Jesus answered
    and said, Verily I'
  '50': say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,

  '2': 'and the last first. &l32&rAnd they were in the way going up to Jerusalem;
    and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were
    afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should
    happen unto him,'
  '3': '&l33&rSaying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered
    unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death,
    and shall deliver him to the Gentiles: &l34&rAnd they shall mock him, and shall
    scourge'
  '4': 'him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall
    rise again. &l35&rAnd James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,
    Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire. &l36&rAnd
    he said unto'
  '5': 'them, What would ye that I should do for you? &l37&rThey said unto him, Grant
    unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand,
    in thy glory. &l38&rBut Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye
    drink of the cup'
  '6': that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? &l39&rAnd they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be
  '7': 'baptized: &l40&rBut to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine
    to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared. &l41&rAnd when
    the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John. &l42&rBut
    Jesus called them'
  '8': 'to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule
    over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority
    upon them. &l43&rBut so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
    among you,'
  '9': 'shall be your minister: &l44&rAnd whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall
    be servant of all. &l45&rFor even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto,
    but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. &l46&rAnd they came to
    Jericho: and as'
  '10': he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. &l47&rAnd when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David,
  '11': 'have mercy on me. &l48&rAnd many charged him that he should hold his peace:
    but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. &l49&rAnd
    Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man,
    saying unto him,'
  '12': Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. &l50&rAnd he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. &l51&rAnd Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my
  '13': sight. &l52&rAnd Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
  '14': 'Chapter 11/nAnd when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany,
    at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, &l2&rAnd saith
    unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be
    entered into it, ye'
  '15': shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him. &l3&rAnd if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither. &l4&rAnd they went their way, and found the colt tied
  '16': 'by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him. &l5&rAnd
    certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
    &l6&rAnd they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
    &l7&rAnd they'
  '17': 'brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon
    him. &l8&rAnd many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches
    off the trees, and strawed them in the way. &l9&rAnd they that went before, and
    they that followed,'
  '18': 'cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
    &l10&rBlessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the
    Lord: Hosanna in the highest. &l11&rAnd Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into
    the temple: and when'
  '19': 'he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come,
    he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. &l12&rAnd on the morrow, when they were
    come from Bethany, he was hungry: &l13&rAnd seeing a fig tree afar off having
    leaves, he came, if'
  '20': 'haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing
    but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet. &l14&rAnd Jesus answered and said
    unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard
    it. &l15&rAnd they'
  '21': 'come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out
    them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers,
    and the seats of them that sold doves; &l16&rAnd would not suffer that any man
    should carry any'
  '22': vessel through the temple. &l17&rAnd he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. &l18&rAnd the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they
  '23': 'might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished
    at his doctrine. &l19&rAnd when even was come, he went out of the city. &l20&rAnd
    in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
    &l21&rAnd'
  '24': Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. &l22&rAnd Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. &l23&rFor verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be
  '25': thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. &l24&rTherefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
  '26': 'pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. &l25&rAnd when
    ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also
    which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. &l26&rBut if ye do not forgive,
    neither will your'
  '27': 'Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. &l27&rAnd they come again
    to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief
    priests, and the scribes, and the elders, &l28&rAnd say unto him, By what authority
    doest thou these'
  '28': things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things? &l29&rAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. &l30&rThe baptism of John, was it from
  '29': 'heaven, or of men? answer me. &l31&rAnd they reasoned with themselves, saying,
    If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? &l32&rBut
    if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that
    he was a'
  '30': prophet indeed. &l33&rAnd they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
  '31': Chapter 12/nAnd he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. &l2&rAnd at the season
  '32': he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. &l3&rAnd they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty. &l4&rAnd again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and
  '33': wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled. &l5&rAnd again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some. &l6&rHaving yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them,
  '34': saying, They will reverence my son. &l7&rBut those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.' &l8&rAnd they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. &l9&rWhat shall
  '35': 'therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen,
    and will give the vineyard unto others. &l10&rAnd have ye not read this scripture;
    The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner: &l11&rThis
    was the'
  '36': 'Lord''s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? &l12&rAnd they sought to
    lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable
    against them: and they left him, and went their way. &l13&rAnd they send unto
    him certain of the'
  '37': 'Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words. &l14&rAnd when
    they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest
    for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of
    God in truth: Is it'
  '38': lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? &l15&rShall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it. &l16&rAnd they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this
  '39': image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. &l17&rAnd Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him. &l18&rThen come unto him the Sadducees,
  '40': which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, &l19&rMaster, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
  '41': '&l20&rNow there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying
    left no seed. &l21&rAnd the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed:
    and the third likewise. &l22&rAnd the seven had her, and left no seed: last of
    all the woman died'
  '42': also. &l23&rIn the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. &l24&rAnd Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of
  '43': 'God? &l25&rFor when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor
    are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. &l26&rAnd as
    touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how
    in the bush God spake'
  '44': 'unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
    God of Jacob? &l27&rHe is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living:
    ye therefore do greatly err. &l28&rAnd one of the scribes came, and having heard
    them reasoning together,'
  '45': 'and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first
    commandment of all? &l29&rAnd Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments
    is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: &l30&rAnd thou shalt love the
    Lord thy God'
  '46': 'with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with
    all thy strength: this is the first commandment. &l31&rAnd the second is like,
    namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment
    greater than'
  '47': 'these. &l32&rAnd the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
    truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: &l33&rAnd to love
    him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul,
    and with all the'
  '48': strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. &l34&rAnd when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any
  '49': question. &l35&rAnd Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David? &l36&rFor David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies
  '50': thy footstool. &l37&rDavid therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.

    &l39&rAnd the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:
    &l40&rWhich'
  '2': 'devour widows'' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall
    receive greater damnation. &l41&rAnd Jesus sat over against the treasury, and
    beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast
    in much. &l42&rAnd there'
  '3': 'came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.

  '6': upon another, that shall not be thrown down. &l3&rAnd as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, &l4&rTell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these
  '7': 'things shall be fulfilled? &l5&rAnd Jesus answering them began to say, Take
    heed lest any man deceive you: &l6&rFor many shall come in my name, saying, I
    am Christ; and shall deceive many. &l7&rAnd when ye shall hear of wars and rumours
    of wars, be ye not'

    nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall
    be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these
    are the'

    you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be
    brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. &l10&rAnd
    the gospel'
  '10': 'must first be published among all nations. &l11&rBut when they shall lead
    you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither
    do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak
    ye: for it is not ye'
  '11': that speak, but the Holy Ghost. &l12&rNow the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death. &l13&rAnd ye shall be hated of all men for my name's
  '12': 'sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. &l14&rBut

  '15': 'time, neither shall be. &l20&rAnd except that the Lord had shortened those
    days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect''s sake, whom he hath chosen,
    he hath shortened the days. &l21&rAnd then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here

    in those days,'
  '17': after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, &l25&rAnd the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. &l26&rAnd then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with

  '23': 'Chapter 14/nAfter two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened

    craft, and put him to death. &l2&rBut they said, Not on the feast day, lest there
    be an uproar of the'
  '24': people. &l3&rAnd being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head. &l4&rAnd there were some that had
  '25': indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? &l5&rFor it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her. &l6&rAnd Jesus said, Let her alone; why
  '26': 'trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. &l7&rFor ye have the
    poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have
    not always. &l8&rShe hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint
    my body to the burying.'

    to betray'
  '28': him unto them. &l11&rAnd when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him. &l12&rAnd the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where
  '29': 'wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover? &l13&rAnd
    he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city,
    and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him. &l14&rAnd
    wheresoever he'
  '30': 'shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where
    is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? &l15&rAnd
    he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for
    us. &l16&rAnd his'
  '31': 'disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto
    them: and they made ready the passover. &l17&rAnd in the evening he cometh with
    the twelve. &l18&rAnd as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,
    One of you which'
  '32': eateth with me shall betray me. &l19&rAnd they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I? &l20&rAnd he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish. &l21&rThe Son of
  '33': 'man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the
    Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born. &l22&rAnd
    as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them,
    and said,'
  '34': 'Take, eat: this is my body. &l23&rAnd he took the cup, and when he had given
    thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. &l24&rAnd he said unto them,
    This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many. &l25&rVerily I
    say unto you, I'
  '35': will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. &l26&rAnd when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. &l27&rAnd Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me
  '36': 'this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall
    be scattered. &l28&rBut after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
    &l29&rBut Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.
    &l30&rAnd Jesus'
  '37': saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. &l31&rBut he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they
  '38': 'all. &l32&rAnd they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith
    to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray. &l33&rAnd he taketh with him
    Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; &l34&rAnd
    saith unto'
  '39': 'them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.
    &l35&rAnd he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if
    it were possible, the hour might pass from him. &l36&rAnd he said, Abba, Father,
    all things are'
  '40': 'possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will,
    but what thou wilt. &l37&rAnd he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith
    unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? &l38&rWatch
    ye and pray, lest ye'
  '41': enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak. &l39&rAnd again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words. &l40&rAnd when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to
  '42': 'answer him. &l41&rAnd he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep
    on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of
    man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. &l42&rRise up, let us go; lo, he that
    betrayeth me is at'
  '43': hand. &l43&rAnd immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. &l44&rAnd he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,
  '44': Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely. &l45&rAnd as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him. &l46&rAnd they laid their hands on him, and took him. &l47&rAnd one of
  '45': them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. &l48&rAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me? &l49&rI was daily with you in the temple
  '46': 'teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled. &l50&rAnd
    they all forsook him, and fled. &l51&rAnd there followed him a certain young man,
    having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on
    him: &l52&rAnd he'
  '47': 'left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. &l53&rAnd they led Jesus
    away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and
    the elders and the scribes. &l54&rAnd Peter followed him afar off, even into the
    palace of the high'
  '48': 'priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire. &l55&rAnd
    the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put
    him to death; and found none. &l56&rFor many bare false witness against him, but
    their witness'
  '49': agreed not together. &l57&rAnd there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, &l58&rWe heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands. &l59&rBut neither so
  '50': did their witness agree together. &l60&rAnd the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?

  '1': 'Chapter 14 Cont./n&l61&rBut he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again
    the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of
    the Blessed? &l62&rAnd Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting
    on the right hand of'
  '2': 'power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. &l63&rThen the high priest rent
    his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses? &l64&rYe have heard
    the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
    &l65&rAnd some began'
  '3': 'to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto
    him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
    &l66&rAnd as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of
    the high priest:'
  '4': '&l67&rAnd when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said,
    And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. &l68&rBut he denied, saying, I know
    not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and
    the cock crew.'
  '5': '&l69&rAnd a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This
    is one of them. &l70&rAnd he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood
    by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean,
    and thy speech'
  '6': agreeth thereto. &l71&rBut he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. &l72&rAnd the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me
  '7': thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.
  '8': Chapter 15/nAnd straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. &l2&rAnd Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the
  '9': 'Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it. &l3&rAnd the chief
    priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. &l4&rAnd Pilate asked
    him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness
    against thee.'
  '10': '&l5&rBut Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled. &l6&rNow at
    that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. &l7&rAnd
    there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection
    with him, who had'
  '11': committed murder in the insurrection. &l8&rAnd the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. &l9&rBut Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? &l10&rFor he knew that the chief
  '12': priests had delivered him for envy. &l11&rBut the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. &l12&rAnd Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the
  '13': Jews? &l13&rAnd they cried out again, Crucify him. &l14&rThen Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. &l15&rAnd so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and
  '14': delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. &l16&rAnd the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. &l17&rAnd they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about
  '15': his head, &l18&rAnd began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! &l19&rAnd they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. &l20&rAnd when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put
  '16': his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. &l21&rAnd they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. &l22&rAnd they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is,
  '17': 'being interpreted, The place of a skull. &l23&rAnd they gave him to drink
    wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. &l24&rAnd when they had crucified
    him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
    &l25&rAnd it was'
  '18': the third hour, and they crucified him. &l26&rAnd the superscription of his accusation was written over, The King Of The Jews. &l27&rAnd with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. &l28&rAnd the scripture was
  '19': fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. &l29&rAnd they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, &l30&rSave thyself, and come down from the
  '20': cross. &l31&rLikewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. &l32&rLet Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified
  '21': with him reviled him. &l33&rAnd when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. &l34&rAnd at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God,
  '22': my God, why hast thou forsaken me? &l35&rAnd some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. &l36&rAnd one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see
  '23': whether Elias will come to take him down. &l37&rAnd Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. &l38&rAnd the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. &l39&rAnd when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he
  '24': 'so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son
    of God. &l40&rThere were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene,
    and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; &l41&r(Who also,
    when he was in'
  '25': Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem. &l42&rAnd now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, &l43&rJoseph of Arimathaea, an
  '26': 'honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and
    went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. &l44&rAnd Pilate marvelled
    if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether
    he had been'
  '27': any while dead. &l45&rAnd when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. &l46&rAnd he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the
  '28': door of the sepulchre. &l47&rAnd Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
  '29': Chapter 16/nAnd when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. &l2&rAnd very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at
  '30': 'the rising of the sun. &l3&rAnd they said among themselves, Who shall roll
    us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? &l4&rAnd when they looked, they
    saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. &l5&rAnd entering into
    the sepulchre,'
  '31': 'they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment;
    and they were affrighted. &l6&rAnd he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek
    Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the
    place where'
  '32': 'they laid him. &l7&rBut go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he
    goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. &l8&rAnd
    they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were
    amazed: neither'
  '33': said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid. &l9&rNow when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils. &l10&rAnd she went and told them that had been with him, as they
  '34': mourned and wept. &l11&rAnd they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not. &l12&rAfter that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country. &l13&rAnd they went and told it unto
  '35': 'the residue: neither believed they them. &l14&rAfterward he appeared unto
    the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness
    of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
    &l15&rAnd he said'
  '36': unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. &l16&rHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. &l17&rAnd these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they
  '37': cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; &l18&rThey shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. &l19&rSo then after the Lord had spoken unto them,
  '38': he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. &l20&rAnd they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.
