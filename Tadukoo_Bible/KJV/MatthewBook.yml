  '1': Chapter 1/nThe book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. &l2&rAbraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; &l3&rAnd Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom;
  '2': and Esrom begat Aram; &l4&rAnd Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; &l5&rAnd Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; &l6&rAnd Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat
  '3': Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; &l7&rAnd Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; &l8&rAnd Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; &l9&rAnd Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz;
  '4': 'and Achaz begat Ezekias; &l10&rAnd Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat
    Amon; and Amon begat Josias; &l11&rAnd Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren,
    about the time they were carried away to Babylon: &l12&rAnd after they were brought
    to Babylon,'
  '5': Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; &l13&rAnd Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; &l14&rAnd Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; &l15&rAnd Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar
  '6': begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; &l16&rAnd Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. &l17&rSo all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into
  '7': 'Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon
    unto Christ are fourteen generations. &l18&rNow the birth of Jesus Christ was
    on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came
    together, she was found'
  '8': with child of the Holy Ghost. &l19&rThen Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. &l20&rBut while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in
  '9': 'a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary
    thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. &l21&rAnd she
    shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save
    his people from'
  '10': their sins. &l22&rNow all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, &l23&rBehold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted
  '11': 'is, God with us. &l24&rThen Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel
    of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: &l25&rAnd knew her not
    till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus.'
  '12': Chapter 2/nNow when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, &l2&rSaying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to
  '13': worship him. &l3&rWhen Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. &l4&rAnd when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. &l5&rAnd
  '14': 'they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the
    prophet, &l6&rAnd thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among
    the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my
    people Israel. &l7&rThen'
  '15': Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. &l8&rAnd he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may
  '16': come and worship him also. &l9&rWhen they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. &l10&rWhen they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding
  '17': 'great joy. &l11&rAnd when they were come into the house, they saw the young
    child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had
    opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense
    and myrrh. &l12&rAnd'
  '18': being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. &l13&rAnd when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child
  '19': 'and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee
    word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. &l14&rWhen he arose,
    he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: &l15&rAnd
    was there until the'
  '20': 'death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by
    the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. &l16&rThen Herod, when
    he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth,
    and slew all the'
  '21': children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, &l17&rnull
  '22': '&l18&rIn Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great
    mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because
    they are not. &l19&rBut when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth
    in a dream to'
  '23': 'Joseph in Egypt, &l20&rSaying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother,
    and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child''s
    life. &l21&rAnd he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into
    the land of'
  '24': 'Israel. &l22&rBut when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the
    room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being
    warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: &l23&rAnd
    he came and dwelt in a'
  '25': 'city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
    prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.'
  '26': 'Chapter 3/nIn those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness
    of Judaea, &l2&rAnd saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. &l3&rFor
    this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one
    crying in the'
  '27': wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. &l4&rAnd the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. &l5&rThen went out to him Jerusalem, and all
  '28': Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, &l6&rAnd were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. &l7&rBut when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to
  '29': 'flee from the wrath to come? &l8&rBring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:
    &l9&rAnd think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for
    I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.'
  '30': '&l10&rAnd now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore
    every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the
    fire. &l11&rI indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that cometh
    after me is mightier'
  '31': 'than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the
    Holy Ghost, and with fire: &l12&rWhose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly
    purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the
    chaff with'
  '32': unquenchable fire. &l13&rThen cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. &l14&rBut John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? &l15&rAnd Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so
  '33': 'now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered
    him. &l16&rAnd Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water:
    and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending
    like a dove, and'
  '34': 'lighting upon him: &l17&rAnd lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved
    Son, in whom I am well pleased.'
  '35': Chapter 4/nThen was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. &l2&rAnd when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. &l3&rAnd when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God,
  '36': command that these stones be made bread. &l4&rBut he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. &l5&rThen the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a
  '37': 'pinnacle of the temple, &l6&rAnd saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God,
    cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning
    thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy
    foot against a'
  '38': stone. &l7&rJesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. &l8&rAgain, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; &l9&rAnd saith unto him,
  '39': 'All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
    &l10&rThen saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou
    shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. &l11&rThen the
    devil leaveth him, and,'
  '40': behold, angels came and ministered unto him. &l12&rNow when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; &l13&rAnd leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and
  '41': 'Nephthalim: &l14&rThat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
    prophet, saying, &l15&rThe land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the
    way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; &l16&rThe people which
    sat in darkness saw'
  '42': 'great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light
    is sprung up. &l17&rFrom that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent:
    for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. &l18&rAnd Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee,
    saw two brethren,'
  '43': 'Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for
    they were fishers. &l19&rAnd he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you
    fishers of men. &l20&rAnd they straightway left their nets, and followed him.
    &l21&rAnd going on'
  '44': from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. &l22&rAnd they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him. &l23&rAnd
  '45': 'Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching
    the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of
    disease among the people. &l24&rAnd his fame went throughout all Syria: and they
    brought unto him all'
  '46': sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. &l25&rAnd there followed him great multitudes of people from
  '47': Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.
  '48': 'Chapter 5/nAnd seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when
    he was set, his disciples came unto him: &l2&rAnd he opened his mouth, and taught
    them, saying, &l3&rBlessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of
    heaven.'
  '49': '&l4&rBlessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. &l5&rBlessed
    are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. &l6&rBlessed are they which do
    hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. &l7&rBlessed
    are the merciful: for'
  '50': 'they shall obtain mercy. &l8&rBlessed are the pure in heart: for they shall
    see God. &l9&rBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children
    of God.'

  '1': 'Chapter 5 Cont./n&l10&rBlessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness''
    sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &l11&rBlessed are ye, when men shall
    revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely,
    for my'
  '2': 'sake. &l12&rRejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven:
    for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. &l13&rYe are the salt
    of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?
    it is'
  '3': thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. &l14&rYe are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. &l15&rNeither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick;
  '4': 'and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. &l16&rLet your light so
    shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which
    is in heaven. &l17&rThink not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
    I am not come'
  '5': to destroy, but to fulfil. &l18&rFor verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. &l19&rWhosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach
  '6': 'men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever
    shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
    &l20&rFor I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness
    of the'
  '7': 'scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
    &l21&rYe have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill;
    and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: &l22&rBut I say unto
    you, That'
  '8': 'whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of
    the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger
    of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell
    fire. &l23&rTherefore if'
  '9': thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; &l24&rLeave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. &l25&rAgree with thine
  '10': adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. &l26&rVerily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence,
  '11': 'till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. &l27&rYe have heard that it was
    said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: &l28&rBut I say unto
    you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery
    with her already in'
  '12': 'his heart. &l29&rAnd if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast
    it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish,
    and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. &l30&rAnd if thy right hand
    offend thee, cut'
  '13': 'it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of
    thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
    &l31&rIt hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a
    writing of divorcement:'
  '14': ' &l32&rBut I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving
    for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall
    marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. &l33&rAgain, ye have heard that
    it hath been said by'
  '15': 'them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto
    the Lord thine oaths: &l34&rBut I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven;
    for it is God''s throne: &l35&rNor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither
    by Jerusalem;'
  '16': 'for it is the city of the great King. &l36&rNeither shalt thou swear by thy
    head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. &l37&rBut let your
    communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh
    of evil. &l38&rYe have'
  '17': 'heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
    &l39&rBut I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee
    on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. &l40&rAnd if any man will sue
    thee at the law, and'
  '18': take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. &l41&rAnd whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. &l42&rGive to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. &l43&rYe have heard that it hath been
  '19': said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. &l44&rBut I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; &l45&rThat ye may be the
  '20': 'children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise
    on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. &l46&rFor
    if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans
    the same?'
  '21': '&l47&rAnd if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do
    not even the publicans so? &l48&rBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
    which is in heaven is perfect.'
  '22': 'Chapter 6/nTake heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them:
    otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. &l2&rTherefore
    when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites
    do in the'
  '23': 'synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I
    say unto you, They have their reward. &l3&rBut when thou doest alms, let not thy
    left hand know what thy right hand doeth: &l4&rThat thine alms may be in secret:
    and thy Father which'
  '24': 'seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. &l5&rAnd when thou prayest,
    thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the
    synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily
    I say unto you,'
  '25': They have their reward. &l6&rBut thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. &l7&rBut when ye pray, use not vain
  '26': 'repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for
    their much speaking. &l8&rBe not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father
    knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. &l9&rAfter this manner
    therefore pray ye: Our'
  '27': Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. &l10&rThy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. &l11&rGive us this day our daily bread. &l12&rAnd forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. &l13&rAnd lead us not into
  '28': 'temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
    and the glory, for ever. Amen. &l14&rFor if ye forgive men their trespasses, your
    heavenly Father will also forgive you: &l15&rBut if ye forgive not men their trespasses,'
  '29': 'neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. &l16&rMoreover when ye
    fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their
    faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have
    their reward. &l17&rBut'
  '30': 'thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; &l18&rThat
    thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and
    thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. &l19&rLay not up
    for yourselves treasures'
  '31': 'upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through
    and steal: &l20&rBut lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
    moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
    &l21&rFor where your'
  '32': 'treasure is, there will your heart be also. &l22&rThe light of the body is
    the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
    &l23&rBut if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore
    the light'
  '33': 'that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! &l24&rNo man can
    serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else
    he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
    &l25&rTherefore I say'
  '34': 'unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
    drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than
    meat, and the body than raiment? &l26&rBehold the fowls of the air: for they sow
    not, neither do they'
  '35': reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? &l27&rWhich of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? &l28&rAnd why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how
  '36': 'they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: &l29&rAnd yet I say unto
    you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. &l30&rWherefore,
    if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast
    into the'
  '37': oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? &l31&rTherefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? &l32&r(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
  '38': 'heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. &l33&rBut
    seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things
    shall be added unto you. &l34&rTake therefore no thought for the morrow: for the
    morrow shall take'
  '39': thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
  '40': 'Chapter 7/nJudge not, that ye be not judged. &l2&rFor with what judgment
    ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured
    to you again. &l3&rAnd why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother''s eye,
    but considerest not'
  '41': the beam that is in thine own eye? &l4&rOr how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? &l5&rThou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see
  '42': clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. &l6&rGive not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. &l7&rAsk, and it shall be given you;
  '43': 'seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: &l8&rFor
    every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that
    knocketh it shall be opened. &l9&rOr what man is there of you, whom if his son
    ask bread, will he give'
  '44': him a stone? &l10&rOr if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? &l11&rIf ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? &l12&rTherefore all
  '45': 'things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them:
    for this is the law and the prophets. &l13&rEnter ye in at the strait gate: for
    wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many
    there be which go in'
  '46': 'thereat: &l14&rBecause strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth
    unto life, and few there be that find it. &l15&rBeware of false prophets, which
    come to you in sheep''s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. &l16&rYe
    shall know them'
  '47': by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? &l17&rEven so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. &l18&rA good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring
  '48': forth good fruit. &l19&rEvery tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. &l20&rWherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. &l21&rNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but
  '49': he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. &l22&rMany will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? &l23&rAnd then will I profess
  '50': 'unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. &l24&rTherefore
    whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto
    a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:'

  '2': 'unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: &l27&rAnd the rain
    descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house;
    and it fell: and great was the fall of it. &l28&rAnd it came to pass, when Jesus
    had ended these'
  '3': 'sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: &l29&rFor he taught them
    as one having authority, and not as the scribes.'
  '4': Chapter 8/nWhen he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. &l2&rAnd, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. &l3&rAnd Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I
  '5': will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. &l4&rAnd Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. &l5&rAnd when Jesus was
  '6': entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, &l6&rAnd saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. &l7&rAnd Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. &l8&rThe centurion answered and said,
  '7': 'Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the
    word only, and my servant shall be healed. &l9&rFor I am a man under authority,
    having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another,
    Come, and he'
  '8': cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. &l10&rWhen Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. &l11&rAnd I say unto you, That many shall come from the
  '9': 'east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the
    kingdom of heaven. &l12&rBut the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into
    outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. &l13&rAnd Jesus
    said unto the'
  '10': centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. &l14&rAnd when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever. &l15&rAnd he touched her hand,
  '11': 'and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them. &l16&rWhen
    the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils:
    and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick: &l17&rThat
    it might be'
  '12': fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses. &l18&rNow when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side. &l19&rAnd a certain scribe came, and
  '13': said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. &l20&rAnd Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. &l21&rAnd another of his disciples said unto
  '14': him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. &l22&rBut Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead. &l23&rAnd when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him. &l24&rAnd, behold, there arose a great tempest in the
  '15': 'sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
    &l25&rAnd his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we
    perish. &l26&rAnd he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?
    Then he arose, and'
  '16': rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. &l27&rBut the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him! &l28&rAnd when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met
  '17': him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. &l29&rAnd, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the
  '18': time? &l30&rAnd there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding. &l31&rSo the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. &l32&rAnd he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they
  '19': 'went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently
    down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. &l33&rAnd they that
    kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what
    was befallen'
  '20': 'to the possessed of the devils. &l34&rAnd, behold, the whole city came out
    to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out
    of their coasts.'
  '21': 'Chapter 9/nAnd he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his
    own city. &l2&rAnd, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying
    on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be
    of good cheer; thy sins'
  '22': be forgiven thee. &l3&rAnd, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. &l4&rAnd Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? &l5&rFor whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or
  '23': to say, Arise, and walk? &l6&rBut that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house. &l7&rAnd he arose, and departed to his house. &l8&rBut
  '24': 'when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had
    given such power unto men. &l9&rAnd as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw
    a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him,
    Follow me. And he arose,'
  '25': and followed him. &l10&rAnd it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. &l11&rAnd when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with
  '26': 'publicans and sinners? &l12&rBut when Jesus heard that, he said unto them,
    They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. &l13&rBut go
    ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am
    not come to call the'
  '27': righteous, but sinners to repentance. &l14&rThen came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? &l15&rAnd Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the
  '28': bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. &l16&rNo man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the
  '29': 'rent is made worse. &l17&rNeither do men put new wine into old bottles: else
    the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they
    put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. &l18&rWhile he spake these
    things unto them,'
  '30': 'behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter
    is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. &l19&rAnd
    Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples. &l20&rAnd, behold, a
    woman, which was'
  '31': 'diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched
    the hem of his garment: &l21&rFor she said within herself, If I may but touch
    his garment, I shall be whole. &l22&rBut Jesus turned him about, and when he saw
    her, he said,'
  '32': 'Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman
    was made whole from that hour. &l23&rAnd when Jesus came into the ruler''s house,
    and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, &l24&rHe said unto them,
    Give place: for the'
  '33': maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. &l25&rBut when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose. &l26&rAnd the fame hereof went abroad into all that land. &l27&rAnd when Jesus departed
  '34': 'thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David,
    have mercy on us. &l28&rAnd when he was come into the house, the blind men came
    to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They
    said unto him, Yea,'
  '35': Lord. &l29&rThen touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. &l30&rAnd their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it. &l31&rBut they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in
  '36': 'all that country. &l32&rAs they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb
    man possessed with a devil. &l33&rAnd when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake:
    and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel. &l34&rBut
    the Pharisees'
  '37': said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils. &l35&rAnd Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
  '38': '&l36&rBut when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them,
    because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
    &l37&rThen saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the
    labourers are few;'
  '39': '&l38&rPray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth
    labourers into his harvest.'
  '40': Chapter 10/nAnd when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. &l2&rNow the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first,
  '41': Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; &l3&rPhilip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; &l4&rSimon the
  '42': 'Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. &l5&rThese twelve Jesus
    sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and
    into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: &l6&rBut go rather to the lost sheep
    of the house'
  '43': 'of Israel. &l7&rAnd as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at
    hand. &l8&rHeal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils:
    freely ye have received, freely give. &l9&rProvide neither gold, nor silver, nor
    brass in your purses,'
  '44': '&l10&rNor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet
    staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat. &l11&rAnd into whatsoever city
    or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go
    thence. &l12&rAnd when'
  '45': 'ye come into an house, salute it. &l13&rAnd if the house be worthy, let your
    peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. &l14&rAnd
    whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that
    house or'
  '46': 'city, shake off the dust of your feet. &l15&rVerily I say unto you, It shall
    be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than
    for that city. &l16&rBehold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves:
    be ye therefore'
  '47': 'wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. &l17&rBut beware of men: for they
    will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
    &l18&rAnd ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony
    against'
  '48': 'them and the Gentiles. &l19&rBut when they deliver you up, take no thought
    how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye
    shall speak. &l20&rFor it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
    which speaketh in you.'
  '49': '&l21&rAnd the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father
    the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them
    to be put to death. &l22&rAnd ye shall be hated of all men for my name''s sake:
    but he that endureth'
  '50': 'to the end shall be saved. &l23&rBut when they persecute you in this city,
    flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the
    cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.'

  '1': Chapter 10 Cont./n&l24&rThe disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. &l25&rIt is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more
  '2': 'shall they call them of his household? &l26&rFear them not therefore: for
    there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not

  '3': 'preach ye upon the housetops. &l28&rAnd fear not them which kill the body,

    both soul and body in hell. &l29&rAre not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and

    will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. &l34&rThink not that I am

    receive a prophet''s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name
    of a righteous man'
  '9': shall receive a righteous man's reward. &l42&rAnd whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
  '10': Chapter 11/nAnd it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities. &l2&rNow when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
  '11': '&l3&rAnd said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
    &l4&rJesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which
    ye do hear and see: &l5&rThe blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the
    lepers are'
  '12': cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. &l6&rAnd blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. &l7&rAnd as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went
  '13': ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? &l8&rBut what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. &l9&rBut what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto
  '14': you, and more than a prophet. &l10&rFor this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. &l11&rVerily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater
  '15': 'than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of
    heaven is greater than he. &l12&rAnd from the days of John the Baptist until now
    the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. &l13&rFor
    all the'
  '16': prophets and the law prophesied until John. &l14&rAnd if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. &l15&rHe that hath ears to hear, let him hear. &l16&rBut whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the
  '17': markets, and calling unto their fellows, &l17&rAnd saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. &l18&rFor John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. &l19&rThe Son of
  '18': man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children. &l20&rThen began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because
  '19': 'they repented not: &l21&rWoe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida!
    for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
    they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. &l22&rBut I say unto
    you, It shall be'
  '20': 'more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. &l23&rAnd
    thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell:
    for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom,
    it would have'
  '21': remained until this day. &l24&rBut I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. &l25&rAt that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast
  '22': 'hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
    &l26&rEven so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. &l27&rAll things are
    delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither
    knoweth any'
  '23': 'man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.
    &l28&rCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
    rest. &l29&rTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
    heart: and ye shall'
  '24': find rest unto your souls. &l30&rFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
  '25': Chapter 12/nAt that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat. &l2&rBut when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not
  '26': lawful to do upon the sabbath day. &l3&rBut he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; &l4&rHow he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat,
  '27': neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests? &l5&rOr have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? &l6&rBut I say unto you, That in this place is one greater
  '28': than the temple. &l7&rBut if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. &l8&rFor the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day. &l9&rAnd when he was departed thence, he went into their
  '29': 'synagogue: &l10&rAnd, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered.
    And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they
    might accuse him. &l11&rAnd he said unto them, What man shall there be among you,
    that shall have one'
  '30': sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? &l12&rHow much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. &l13&rThen saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine
  '31': 'hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.
    &l14&rThen the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might
    destroy him. &l15&rBut when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
    great'
  '32': 'multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; &l16&rAnd charged them that
    they should not make him known: &l17&rThat it might be fulfilled which was spoken
    by Esaias the prophet, saying, &l18&rBehold my servant, whom I have chosen; my
    beloved, in whom'
  '33': 'my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew
    judgment to the Gentiles. &l19&rHe shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any
    man hear his voice in the streets. &l20&rA bruised reed shall he not break, and
    smoking flax shall he'
  '34': 'not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. &l21&rAnd in his name
    shall the Gentiles trust. &l22&rThen was brought unto him one possessed with a
    devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both
    spake and saw.'
  '35': '&l23&rAnd all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?
    &l24&rBut when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out
    devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. &l25&rAnd Jesus knew their
    thoughts, and said'
  '36': 'unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation;
    and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: &l26&rAnd if Satan
    cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?
    &l27&rAnd if I by'
  '37': Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. &l28&rBut if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. &l29&rOr else how can one enter into a strong man's
  '38': house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. &l30&rHe that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. &l31&rWherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and
  '39': 'blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy
    Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. &l32&rAnd whosoever speaketh a word against
    the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy
    Ghost, it shall not'
  '40': 'be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. &l33&rEither
    make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his
    fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. &l34&rO generation of vipers,
    how can ye,'
  '41': 'being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the
    mouth speaketh. &l35&rA good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth
    forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil
    things. &l36&rBut I say'
  '42': unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. &l37&rFor by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. &l38&rThen certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees
  '43': 'answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. &l39&rBut he answered
    and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and
    there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: &l40&rFor
    as Jonas was'
  '44': 'three days and three nights in the whale''s belly; so shall the Son of man
    be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. &l41&rThe men of Nineveh
    shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they
    repented at the'
  '45': 'preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. &l42&rThe
    queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall
    condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom
    of Solomon; and,'
  '46': behold, a greater than Solomon is here. &l43&rWhen the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. &l44&rThen he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he
  '47': 'findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. &l45&rThen goeth he, and taketh with
    himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell
    there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it
    be also unto this'
  '48': wicked generation. &l46&rWhile he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. &l47&rThen one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.
  '49': '&l48&rBut he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother?
    and who are my brethren? &l49&rAnd he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples,
    and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! &l50&rFor whosoever shall do the will
    of my Father'
  '50': which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

  '1': Chapter 13 Cont./nChapter 13/nThe same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side. &l2&rAnd great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. &l3&rAnd he spake
  '2': 'many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
    &l4&rAnd when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and
    devoured them up: &l5&rSome fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth:
    and forthwith'
  '3': 'they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: &l6&rAnd when the sun
    was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
    &l7&rAnd some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: &l8&rBut
    other fell into'
  '4': good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. &l9&rWho hath ears to hear, let him hear. &l10&rAnd the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? &l11&rHe answered and said unto
  '5': 'them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
    heaven, but to them it is not given. &l12&rFor whosoever hath, to him shall be
    given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall
    be taken away even'
  '6': 'that he hath. &l13&rTherefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing
    see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. &l14&rAnd in them
    is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and
    shall not'
  '7': 'understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: &l15&rFor this
    people''s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their
    eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear
    with their ears, and'
  '8': 'should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should
    heal them. &l16&rBut blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they
    hear. &l17&rFor verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have
    desired to see'
  '9': those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. &l18&rHear ye therefore the parable of the sower. &l19&rWhen any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh
  '10': the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. &l20&rBut he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; &l21&rYet hath
  '11': 'he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution
    ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. &l22&rHe also that received
    seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world,
    and the'
  '12': deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. &l23&rBut he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some
  '13': 'thirty. &l24&rAnother parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom
    of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: &l25&rBut
    while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his
    way. &l26&rBut when the'
  '14': blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. &l27&rSo the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? &l28&rHe said unto them, An enemy
  '15': 'hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and
    gather them up? &l29&rBut he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye
    root up also the wheat with them. &l30&rLet both grow together until the harvest:
    and in the time of'
  '16': 'harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and
    bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. &l31&rAnother
    parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain
    of mustard seed,'
  '17': 'which a man took, and sowed in his field: &l32&rWhich indeed is the least
    of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh
    a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. &l33&rAnother
    parable'
  '18': spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. &l34&rAll these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto
  '19': 'them: &l35&rThat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
    I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret
    from the foundation of the world. &l36&rThen Jesus sent the multitude away, and
    went into the'
  '20': 'house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable
    of the tares of the field. &l37&rHe answered and said unto them, He that soweth
    the good seed is the Son of man; &l38&rThe field is the world; the good seed are
    the children of the'
  '21': kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; &l39&rThe enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. &l40&rAs therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be
  '22': 'in the end of this world. &l41&rThe Son of man shall send forth his angels,
    and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which
    do iniquity; &l42&rAnd shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be
    wailing and gnashing'
  '23': of teeth. &l43&rThen shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. &l44&rAgain, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and
  '24': 'for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
    &l45&rAgain, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly
    pearls: &l46&rWho, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all
    that he had, and'
  '25': 'bought it. &l47&rAgain, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was
    cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: &l48&rWhich, when it was full,
    they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast
    the bad away. &l49&rSo'
  '26': 'shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever
    the wicked from among the just, &l50&rAnd shall cast them into the furnace of
    fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. &l51&rJesus saith unto them,
    Have ye understood'
  '27': all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. &l52&rThen said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.
  '28': '&l53&rAnd it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he
    departed thence. &l54&rAnd when he was come into his own country, he taught them
    in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath
    this man this wisdom,'
  '29': and these mighty works? &l55&rIs not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? &l56&rAnd his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? &l57&rAnd
  '30': they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. &l58&rAnd he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
  '31': Chapter 14/nAt that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, &l2&rAnd said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. &l3&rFor Herod had laid hold on John,
  '32': and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. &l4&rFor John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. &l5&rAnd when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a
  '33': prophet. &l6&rBut when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. &l7&rWhereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. &l8&rAnd she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give
  '34': 'me here John Baptist''s head in a charger. &l9&rAnd the king was sorry: nevertheless
    for the oath''s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to
    be given her. &l10&rAnd he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. &l11&rAnd his
    head was'
  '35': 'brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her
    mother. &l12&rAnd his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and
    went and told Jesus. &l13&rWhen Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship
    into a desert place apart:'
  '36': and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. &l14&rAnd Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. &l15&rAnd when it was evening, his disciples
  '37': came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. &l16&rBut Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. &l17&rAnd they say
  '38': unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. &l18&rHe said, Bring them hither to me. &l19&rAnd he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake,
  '39': 'and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
    &l20&rAnd they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments
    that remained twelve baskets full. &l21&rAnd they that had eaten were about five
    thousand men, beside'
  '40': women and children. &l22&rAnd straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. &l23&rAnd when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to
  '41': 'pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. &l24&rBut the ship
    was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
    &l25&rAnd in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the
    sea. &l26&rAnd when'
  '42': the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. &l27&rBut straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. &l28&rAnd Peter answered him and said, Lord,
  '43': if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. &l29&rAnd he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. &l30&rBut when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried,
  '44': saying, Lord, save me. &l31&rAnd immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? &l32&rAnd when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. &l33&rThen they that were in
  '45': the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. &l34&rAnd when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. &l35&rAnd when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round
  '46': 'about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; &l36&rAnd besought him
    that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were
    made perfectly whole.'
  '47': Chapter 15/nThen came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, &l2&rWhy do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. &l3&rBut he answered and said unto them, Why do ye
  '48': 'also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? &l4&rFor God commanded,
    saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let
    him die the death. &l5&rBut ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
    It is a'
  '49': gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; &l6&rAnd honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. &l7&rYe hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
  '50': '&l8&rThis people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me
    with their lips; but their heart is far from me. &l9&rBut in vain they do worship
    me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.'

  '1': 'Chapter 15 Cont./n&l10&rAnd he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear,
    and understand: &l11&rNot that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but
    that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. &l12&rThen came his disciples,
    and said'
  '2': 'unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard
    this saying? &l13&rBut he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father
    hath not planted, shall be rooted up. &l14&rLet them alone: they be blind leaders
    of the blind. And'
  '3': if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. &l15&rThen answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. &l16&rAnd Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? &l17&rDo not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in
  '4': at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? &l18&rBut those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. &l19&rFor out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
  '5': 'fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: &l20&rThese are the things
    which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. &l21&rThen
    Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. &l22&rAnd,
    behold, a woman of'
  '6': Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. &l23&rBut he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away;
  '7': for she crieth after us. &l24&rBut he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. &l25&rThen came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. &l26&rBut he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's
  '8': 'bread, and to cast it to dogs. &l27&rAnd she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs
    eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters'' table. &l28&rThen Jesus answered
    and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.
    And her'
  '9': daughter was made whole from that very hour. &l29&rAnd Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. &l30&rAnd great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame,
  '10': 'blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus'' feet;
    and he healed them: &l31&rInsomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw
    the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to
    see: and they glorified the'
  '11': 'God of Israel. &l32&rThen Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said,
    I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days,
    and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint
    in the way. &l33&rAnd'
  '12': his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? &l34&rAnd Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. &l35&rAnd he commanded the
  '13': 'multitude to sit down on the ground. &l36&rAnd he took the seven loaves and
    the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the
    disciples to the multitude. &l37&rAnd they did all eat, and were filled: and they
    took up of the'
  '14': broken meat that was left seven baskets full. &l38&rAnd they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. &l39&rAnd he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
  '15': 'Chapter 16/nThe Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired
    him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. &l2&rHe answered and said unto
    them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.
    &l3&rAnd in the'
  '16': 'morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering.
    O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the
    signs of the times? &l4&rA wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign;
    and there shall no'
  '17': sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. &l5&rAnd when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. &l6&rThen Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the
  '18': Pharisees and of the Sadducees. &l7&rAnd they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread. &l8&rWhich when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no
  '19': bread? &l9&rDo ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? &l10&rNeither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? &l11&rHow is it that ye do not understand
  '20': that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? &l12&rThen understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the
  '21': 'Sadducees. &l13&rWhen Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he
    asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? &l14&rAnd
    they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias,
    or one of the'
  '22': 'prophets. &l15&rHe saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? &l16&rAnd
    Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
    &l17&rAnd Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for
    flesh and blood hath'
  '23': not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. &l18&rAnd I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. &l19&rAnd I will give unto thee the keys of the
  '24': 'kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
    in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
    &l20&rThen charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus
    the Christ.'
  '25': '&l21&rFrom that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that
    he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests
    and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. &l22&rThen Peter
    took him, and'
  '26': 'began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be
    unto thee. &l23&rBut he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
    thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God,
    but those that be of'
  '27': 'men. &l24&rThen said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after
    me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. &l25&rFor whosoever
    will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake
    shall find it.'
  '28': '&l26&rFor what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose
    his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? &l27&rFor the
    Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he
    shall reward every man'
  '29': according to his works. &l28&rVerily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
  '30': 'Chapter 17/nAnd after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother,
    and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, &l2&rAnd was transfigured before
    them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
    &l3&rAnd,'
  '31': 'behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. &l4&rThen
    answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou
    wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and
    one for Elias.'
  '32': '&l5&rWhile he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold
    a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
    pleased; hear ye him. &l6&rAnd when the disciples heard it, they fell on their
    face, and were sore'
  '33': afraid. &l7&rAnd Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. &l8&rAnd when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only. &l9&rAnd as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no
  '34': man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead. &l10&rAnd his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? &l11&rAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.
  '35': '&l12&rBut I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not,
    but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of
    man suffer of them. &l13&rThen the disciples understood that he spake unto them
    of John the Baptist.'
  '36': '&l14&rAnd when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain
    man, kneeling down to him, and saying, &l15&rLord, have mercy on my son: for he
    is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into
    the water.'
  '37': '&l16&rAnd I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. &l17&rThen
    Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I
    be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. &l18&rAnd Jesus
    rebuked the'
  '38': 'devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very
    hour. &l19&rThen came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we
    cast him out? &l20&rAnd Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily
    I say unto you, If'
  '39': ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. &l21&rHowbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. &l22&rAnd while they
  '40': 'abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed
    into the hands of men: &l23&rAnd they shall kill him, and the third day he shall
    be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry. &l24&rAnd when they were come
    to Capernaum, they that'
  '41': received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? &l25&rHe saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of
  '42': their own children, or of strangers? &l26&rPeter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free. &l27&rNotwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh
  '43': 'up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money:
    that take, and give unto them for me and thee.'
  '44': Chapter 18/nAt the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? &l2&rAnd Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, &l3&rAnd said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted,
  '45': and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. &l4&rWhosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. &l5&rAnd whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
  '46': receiveth me. &l6&rBut whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. &l7&rWoe unto the world because of offences! for
  '47': 'it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence
    cometh! &l8&rWherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and
    cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed,
    rather than having two'
  '48': 'hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. &l9&rAnd if thine eye
    offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter
    into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
    &l10&rTake heed that'
  '49': ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. &l11&rFor the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. &l12&rHow think ye? if a man have an hundred
  '50': sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?

  '1': Chapter 18 Cont./n&l13&rAnd if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. &l14&rEven so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little
  '2': 'ones should perish. &l15&rMoreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee,
    go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou
    hast gained thy brother. &l16&rBut if he will not hear thee, then take with thee
    one or two'
  '3': 'more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
    &l17&rAnd if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he
    neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.
    &l18&rVerily'
  '4': 'I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven:
    and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. &l19&rAgain
    I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing
    that they shall ask, it'
  '5': shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. &l20&rFor where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. &l21&rThen came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive
  '6': 'him? till seven times? &l22&rJesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until
    seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. &l23&rTherefore is the kingdom of
    heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.
    &l24&rAnd when he had'
  '7': begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. &l25&rBut forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. &l26&rThe servant
  '8': therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. &l27&rThen the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. &l28&rBut the same servant went out, and found
  '9': 'one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands
    on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. &l29&rAnd
    his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience
    with me, and I will'
  '10': 'pay thee all. &l30&rAnd he would not: but went and cast him into prison,
    till he should pay the debt. &l31&rSo when his fellowservants saw what was done,
    they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. &l32&rThen
    his lord, after'
  '11': 'that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee
    all that debt, because thou desiredst me: &l33&rShouldest not thou also have had
    compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? &l34&rAnd his lord
    was wroth, and'
  '12': delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. &l35&rSo likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
  '13': Chapter 19/nAnd it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; &l2&rAnd great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there. &l3&rThe Pharisees also came unto
  '14': him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? &l4&rAnd he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, &l5&rAnd said, For this
  '15': 'cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife:
    and they twain shall be one flesh? &l6&rWherefore they are no more twain, but
    one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. &l7&rThey
    say unto him, Why'
  '16': 'did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
    &l8&rHe saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered
    you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. &l9&rAnd I say
    unto you,'
  '17': 'Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall
    marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth
    commit adultery. &l10&rHis disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so
    with his wife, it'
  '18': 'is not good to marry. &l11&rBut he said unto them, All men cannot receive
    this saying, save they to whom it is given. &l12&rFor there are some eunuchs,
    which were so born from their mother''s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which
    were made eunuchs of men:'
  '19': 'and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom
    of heaven''s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. &l13&rThen
    were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them,
    and pray: and the'
  '20': 'disciples rebuked them. &l14&rBut Jesus said, Suffer little children, and
    forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. &l15&rAnd
    he laid his hands on them, and departed thence. &l16&rAnd, behold, one came and
    said unto him, Good'
  '21': 'Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? &l17&rAnd
    he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is,
    God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. &l18&rHe saith unto
    him, Which? Jesus'
  '22': 'said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt
    not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, &l19&rHonour thy father and thy
    mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. &l20&rThe young man saith
    unto him, All these'
  '23': 'things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? &l21&rJesus said unto
    him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,
    and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. &l22&rBut when
    the young man heard'
  '24': 'that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. &l23&rThen
    said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly
    enter into the kingdom of heaven. &l24&rAnd again I say unto you, It is easier
    for a camel to'
  '25': go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. &l25&rWhen his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? &l26&rBut Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is
  '26': impossible; but with God all things are possible. &l27&rThen answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? &l28&rAnd Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed
  '27': me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. &l29&rAnd every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or
  '28': wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. &l30&rBut many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
  '29': Chapter 20/nFor the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. &l2&rAnd when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
  '30': '&l3&rAnd he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in
    the marketplace, &l4&rAnd said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever
    is right I will give you. And they went their way. &l5&rAgain he went out about
    the sixth and'
  '31': ninth hour, and did likewise. &l6&rAnd about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? &l7&rThey say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into
  '32': the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. &l8&rSo when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. &l9&rAnd when they came that
  '33': were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. &l10&rBut when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. &l11&rAnd when they had received it, they murmured against
  '34': 'the goodman of the house, &l12&rSaying, These last have wrought but one hour,
    and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of
    the day. &l13&rBut he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong:
    didst not thou'
  '35': 'agree with me for a penny? &l14&rTake that thine is, and go thy way: I will
    give unto this last, even as unto thee. &l15&rIs it not lawful for me to do what
    I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? &l16&rSo the last
    shall be first, and'
  '36': 'the first last: for many be called, but few chosen. &l17&rAnd Jesus going
    up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
    &l18&rBehold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto
    the chief priests and'
  '37': 'unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, &l19&rAnd shall deliver
    him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third
    day he shall rise again. &l20&rThen came to him the mother of Zebedees children
    with her sons,'
  '38': worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. &l21&rAnd he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom. &l22&rBut Jesus answered and
  '39': said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. &l23&rAnd he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be
  '40': 'baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right
    hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom
    it is prepared of my Father. &l24&rAnd when the ten heard it, they were moved
    with indignation'
  '41': 'against the two brethren. &l25&rBut Jesus called them unto him, and said,
    Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they
    that are great exercise authority upon them. &l26&rBut it shall not be so among
    you: but whosoever will'
  '42': 'be great among you, let him be your minister; &l27&rAnd whosoever will be
    chief among you, let him be your servant: &l28&rEven as the Son of man came not
    to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
    &l29&rAnd as they'
  '43': departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. &l30&rAnd, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. &l31&rAnd the multitude rebuked them,
  '44': 'because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have
    mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. &l32&rAnd Jesus stood still, and called
    them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you? &l33&rThey say unto him,
    Lord, that our eyes'
  '45': 'may be opened. &l34&rSo Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes:
    and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.'
  '46': Chapter 21/nAnd when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, &l2&rSaying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with
  '47': 'her: loose them, and bring them unto me. &l3&rAnd if any man say ought unto
    you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
    &l4&rAll this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
    saying,'
  '48': '&l5&rTell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek,
    and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass. &l6&rAnd the disciples
    went, and did as Jesus commanded them, &l7&rAnd brought the ass, and the colt,
    and put on them their'
  '49': clothes, and they set him thereon. &l8&rAnd a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way. &l9&rAnd the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna
  '50': 'to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna
    in the highest. &l10&rAnd when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
    saying, Who is this?'

  '1': Chapter 21 Cont./n&l11&rAnd the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. &l12&rAnd Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the
  '2': seats of them that sold doves, &l13&rAnd said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. &l14&rAnd the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them. &l15&rAnd when the
  '3': chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased, &l16&rAnd said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea;
  '4': have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? &l17&rAnd he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there. &l18&rNow in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. &l19&rAnd when
  '5': he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away. &l20&rAnd when the disciples saw it, they marvelled,
  '6': saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away! &l21&rJesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou
  '7': removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. &l22&rAnd all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. &l23&rAnd when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he
  '8': was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? &l24&rAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these
  '9': things. &l25&rThe baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? &l26&rBut if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people;
  '10': for all hold John as a prophet. &l27&rAnd they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. &l28&rBut what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said,
  '11': 'Son, go work to day in my vineyard. &l29&rHe answered and said, I will not:
    but afterward he repented, and went. &l30&rAnd he came to the second, and said
    likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not. &l31&rWhether of
    them twain did the will'
  '12': 'of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily
    I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God
    before you. &l32&rFor John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed
    him not: but the'
  '13': 'publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented
    not afterward, that ye might believe him. &l33&rHear another parable: There was
    a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and
    digged a winepress'
  '14': 'in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far
    country: &l34&rAnd when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
    to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. &l35&rAnd the husbandmen
    took his'
  '15': 'servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. &l36&rAgain,
    he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. &l37&rBut
    last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. &l38&rBut
    when'
  '16': the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. &l39&rAnd they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. &l40&rWhen the lord therefore of the vineyard
  '17': cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? &l41&rThey say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons. &l42&rJesus saith unto them, Did ye
  '18': 'never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the
    same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord''s doing, and it is marvellous
    in our eyes? &l43&rTherefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken
    from you, and'
  '19': 'given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. &l44&rAnd whosoever
    shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it
    will grind him to powder. &l45&rAnd when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard
    his parables, they'
  '20': perceived that he spake of them. &l46&rBut when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
  '21': 'Chapter 22/nAnd Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
    said, &l2&rThe kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage
    for his son, &l3&rAnd sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to
    the wedding: and'
  '22': 'they would not come. &l4&rAgain, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell
    them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings
    are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage. &l5&rBut they made
    light of it, and'
  '23': 'went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: &l6&rAnd the
    remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. &l7&rBut
    when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed
    those'
  '24': murderers, and burned up their city. &l8&rThen saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. &l9&rGo ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. &l10&rSo those servants
  '25': 'went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found,
    both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests. &l11&rAnd when the
    king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding
    garment: &l12&rAnd'
  '26': he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. &l13&rThen said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and
  '27': gnashing of teeth. &l14&rFor many are called, but few are chosen. &l15&rThen went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. &l16&rAnd they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that
  '28': 'thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou
    for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men. &l17&rTell us therefore,
    What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? &l18&rBut
    Jesus perceived their'
  '29': wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? &l19&rShew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. &l20&rAnd he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? &l21&rThey say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them,
  '30': Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's. &l22&rWhen they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way. &l23&rThe same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there
  '31': 'is no resurrection, and asked him, &l24&rSaying, Master, Moses said, If a
    man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed
    unto his brother. &l25&rNow there were with us seven brethren: and the first,
    when he had married a'
  '32': 'wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother: &l26&rLikewise
    the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. &l27&rAnd last of all the woman
    died also. &l28&rTherefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
    seven? for'
  '33': they all had her. &l29&rJesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. &l30&rFor in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. &l31&rBut as
  '34': touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, &l32&rI am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. &l33&rAnd when the
  '35': multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. &l34&rBut when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. &l35&rThen one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and
  '36': saying, &l36&rMaster, which is the great commandment in the law? &l37&rJesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. &l38&rThis is the first and great commandment. &l39&rAnd the
  '37': second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. &l40&rOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. &l41&rWhile the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, &l42&rSaying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he?
  '38': They say unto him, The son of David. &l43&rHe saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, &l44&rThe Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? &l45&rIf David then call him Lord, how
  '39': is he his son? &l46&rAnd no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
  '40': 'Chapter 23/nThen spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, &l2&rSaying
    The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses'' seat: &l3&rAll therefore whatsoever
    they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for
    they say, and'
  '41': 'do not. &l4&rFor they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
    them on men''s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their
    fingers. &l5&rBut all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad

  '1': Chapter 23 Cont./n&l24&rYe blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. &l25&rWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
  '2': '&l26&rThou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and

    and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed
    appear beautiful'
  '3': outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. &l28&rEven so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. &l29&rWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build
  '4': the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, &l30&rAnd say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. &l31&rWherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that
  '5': ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. &l32&rFill ye up then the measure of your fathers. &l33&rYe serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell? &l34&rWherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men,
  '6': 'and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them
    shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: &l35&rThat
    upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood
    of righteous Abel'
  '7': unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. &l36&rVerily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation. &l37&rO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which
  '8': are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! &l38&rBehold, your house is left unto you desolate. &l39&rFor I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth,
  '9': till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
  '10': 'Chapter 24/nAnd Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples
    came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple. &l2&rAnd Jesus said unto
    them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left
    here one'
  '11': stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. &l3&rAnd as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
  '12': '&l4&rAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive
    you. &l5&rFor many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive
    many. &l6&rAnd ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled:
    for all these'
  '13': 'things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. &l7&rFor nation shall rise
    against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences,
    and earthquakes, in divers places. &l8&rAll these are the beginning of sorrows.
    &l9&rThen'
  '14': 'shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall
    be hated of all nations for my name''s sake. &l10&rAnd then shall many be offended,
    and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. &l11&rAnd many false
    prophets shall'
  '15': rise, and shall deceive many. &l12&rAnd because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. &l13&rBut he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. &l14&rAnd this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a
  '16': witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. &l15&rWhen ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) &l16&rThen let them which be in Judaea
  '17': 'flee into the mountains: &l17&rLet him which is on the housetop not come
    down to take any thing out of his house: &l18&rNeither let him which is in the
    field return back to take his clothes. &l19&rAnd woe unto them that are with child,
    and to them that'
  '18': 'give suck in those days! &l20&rBut pray ye that your flight be not in the
    winter, neither on the sabbath day: &l21&rFor then shall be great tribulation,
    such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall
    be. &l22&rAnd except'
  '19': 'those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the
    elect''s sake those days shall be shortened. &l23&rThen if any man shall say unto
    you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. &l24&rFor there shall arise
    false Christs, and'
  '20': 'false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if
    it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. &l25&rBehold, I have told
    you before. &l26&rWherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert;
    go not forth:'
  '21': behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. &l27&rFor as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. &l28&rFor wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered
  '22': 'together. &l29&rImmediately after the tribulation of those days shall the
    sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall
    from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: &l30&rAnd then shall
    appear the sign of'
  '23': 'the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn,
    and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and
    great glory. &l31&rAnd he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
    and they shall'
  '24': 'gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to
    the other. &l32&rNow learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender,
    and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: &l33&rSo likewise ye, when
    ye shall see all'
  '25': these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. &l34&rVerily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. &l35&rHeaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. &l36&rBut of that day and hour
  '26': knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. &l37&rBut as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. &l38&rFor as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
  '27': marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, &l39&rAnd knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. &l40&rThen shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
  '28': '&l41&rTwo women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and
    the other left. &l42&rWatch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
    come. &l43&rBut know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what
    watch the thief would'
  '29': 'come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be
    broken up. &l44&rTherefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not
    the Son of man cometh. &l45&rWho then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his
    lord hath made ruler'
  '30': over his household, to give them meat in due season? &l46&rBlessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. &l47&rVerily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. &l48&rBut and if that evil servant shall say
  '31': in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; &l49&rAnd shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; &l50&rThe lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,
  '32': '&l51&rAnd shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites:
    there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
  '33': Chapter 25/nThen shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. &l2&rAnd five of them were wise, and five were foolish. &l3&rThey that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil
  '34': 'with them: &l4&rBut the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
    &l5&rWhile the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. &l6&rAnd at midnight
    there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. &l7&rThen
    all those'
  '35': 'virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. &l8&rAnd the foolish said unto the
    wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. &l9&rBut the wise answered,
    saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them
    that sell, and'
  '36': 'buy for yourselves. &l10&rAnd while they went to buy, the bridegroom came;
    and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
    &l11&rAfterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. &l12&rBut
    he answered'
  '37': and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. &l13&rWatch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. &l14&rFor the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and
  '38': delivered unto them his goods. &l15&rAnd unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. &l16&rThen he that had received the five talents went and traded
  '39': with the same, and made them other five talents. &l17&rAnd likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. &l18&rBut he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. &l19&rAfter a long time the lord of those
  '40': 'servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. &l20&rAnd so he that had received
    five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst
    unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. &l21&rHis
    lord said unto'
  '41': 'him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over
    a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy
    of thy lord. &l22&rHe also that had received two talents came and said, Lord,
    thou deliveredst unto'
  '42': 'me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. &l23&rHis
    lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful
    over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the
    joy of thy'
  '43': 'lord. &l24&rThen he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord,
    I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering
    where thou hast not strawed: &l25&rAnd I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent
    in the earth:'
  '44': 'lo, there thou hast that is thine. &l26&rHis lord answered and said unto
    him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed
    not, and gather where I have not strawed: &l27&rThou oughtest therefore to have
    put my money to the'
  '45': 'exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
    &l28&rTake therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten
    talents. &l29&rFor unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
    abundance: but from'
  '46': 'him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. &l30&rAnd
    cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and
    gnashing of teeth. &l31&rWhen the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all
    the holy angels with'
  '47': 'him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: &l32&rAnd before him
    shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as
    a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: &l33&rAnd he shall set the sheep
    on his right hand, but'
  '48': 'the goats on the left. &l34&rThen shall the King say unto them on his right
    hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
    the foundation of the world: &l35&rFor I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat:
    I was thirsty, and ye'
  '49': 'gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: &l36&rNaked, and ye clothed
    me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. &l37&rThen
    shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and
    fed thee? or'
  '50': thirsty, and gave thee drink? &l38&rWhen saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? &l39&rOr when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

  '2': 'from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
    angels: &l42&rFor I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and

  '4': 'Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these,
    ye did it not to me. &l46&rAnd these shall go away into everlasting punishment:
    but the righteous into life eternal.'
  '5': Chapter 26/nAnd it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, &l2&rYe know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. &l3&rThen assembled together the chief
  '6': priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, &l4&rAnd consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. &l5&rBut they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
  '7': among the people. &l6&rNow when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, &l7&rThere came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. &l8&rBut when his disciples saw it,
  '8': they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? &l9&rFor this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. &l10&rWhen Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
  '9': ' &l11&rFor ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. &l12&rFor
    in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. &l13&rVerily
    I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world,
    there'
  '10': shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. &l14&rThen one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, &l15&rAnd said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they
  '11': covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. &l16&rAnd from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. &l17&rNow the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee
  '12': to eat the passover? &l18&rAnd he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. &l19&rAnd the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made
  '13': ready the passover. &l20&rNow when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. &l21&rAnd as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. &l22&rAnd they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto
  '14': 'him, Lord, is it I? &l23&rAnd he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand
    with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. &l24&rThe Son of man goeth as it
    is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it
    had been good for'
  '15': that man if he had not been born. &l25&rThen Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. &l26&rAnd as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and
  '16': said, Take, eat; this is my body. &l27&rAnd he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; &l28&rFor this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. &l29&rBut I say unto you, I
  '17': will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. &l30&rAnd when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. &l31&rThen saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be
  '18': 'offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd,
    and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. &l32&rBut after I am risen
    again, I will go before you into Galilee. &l33&rPeter answered and said unto him,
    Though all'
  '19': men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. &l34&rJesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. &l35&rPeter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
  '20': not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. &l36&rThen cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. &l37&rAnd he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
  '21': 'began to be sorrowful and very heavy. &l38&rThen saith he unto them, My soul
    is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. &l39&rAnd
    he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father,
    if it be'
  '22': 'possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou
    wilt. &l40&rAnd he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith
    unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? &l41&rWatch and pray, that
    ye enter not'
  '23': 'into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. &l42&rHe
    went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup
    may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. &l43&rAnd he came
    and found them'
  '24': 'asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. &l44&rAnd he left them, and went
    away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. &l45&rThen cometh
    he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold,
    the hour is at'
  '25': 'hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. &l46&rRise,
    let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. &l47&rAnd while he
    yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude
    with swords and staves,'
  '26': 'from the chief priests and elders of the people. &l48&rNow he that betrayed
    him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him
    fast. &l49&rAnd forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed
    him. &l50&rAnd Jesus'
  '27': said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him. &l51&rAnd, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off
  '28': 'his ear. &l52&rThen said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his
    place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. &l53&rThinkest
    thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more
    than twelve legions'
  '29': of angels? &l54&rBut how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? &l55&rIn that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the
  '30': temple, and ye laid no hold on me. &l56&rBut all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. &l57&rAnd they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where
  '31': the scribes and the elders were assembled. &l58&rBut Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. &l59&rNow the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness
  '32': 'against Jesus, to put him to death; &l60&rBut found none: yea, though many
    false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
    &l61&rAnd said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and
    to build it in three'
  '33': days. &l62&rAnd the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? &l63&rBut Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell
  '34': 'us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. &l64&rJesus saith unto him,
    Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of
    man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. &l65&rThen
    the high priest'
  '35': rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. &l66&rWhat think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. &l67&rThen did they spit in his face, and buffeted him;
  '36': 'and others smote him with the palms of their hands, &l68&rSaying, Prophesy
    unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? &l69&rNow Peter sat without in
    the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
    &l70&rBut he'
  '37': denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. &l71&rAnd when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. &l72&rAnd again he denied with an oath, I do
  '38': not know the man. &l73&rAnd after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. &l74&rThen began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock
  '39': crew. &l75&rAnd Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
  '40': 'Chapter 27/nWhen the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
    the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: &l2&rAnd when they
    had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
    &l3&rThen Judas,'
  '41': which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, &l4&rSaying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that
  '42': to us? see thou to that. &l5&rAnd he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. &l6&rAnd the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the
  '43': price of blood. &l7&rAnd they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. &l8&rWherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. &l9&rThen was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
  '44': 'And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued,
    whom they of the children of Israel did value; &l10&rAnd gave them for the potter''s
    field, as the Lord appointed me. &l11&rAnd Jesus stood before the governor: and
    the governor'
  '45': asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. &l12&rAnd when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. &l13&rThen said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness
  '46': against thee? &l14&rAnd he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. &l15&rNow at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. &l16&rAnd they had then a notable prisoner, called
  '47': Barabbas. &l17&rTherefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? &l18&rFor he knew that for envy they had delivered him. &l19&rWhen he was set down on the
  '48': 'judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with
    that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of
    him. &l20&rBut the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they
    should ask Barabbas, and'
  '49': destroy Jesus. &l21&rThe governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. &l22&rPilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him
  '50': be crucified. &l23&rAnd the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

  '1': 'Chapter 27 Cont./n&l24&rWhen Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but
    that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the
    multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.
    &l25&rThen answered'
  '2': 'all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. &l26&rThen
    released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him
    to be crucified. &l27&rThen the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
    hall, and'
  '3': 'gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. &l28&rAnd they stripped him,
    and put on him a scarlet robe. &l29&rAnd when they had platted a crown of thorns,
    they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee
    before him, and'
  '4': mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! &l30&rAnd they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. &l31&rAnd after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify
  '5': 'him. &l32&rAnd as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name:
    him they compelled to bear his cross. &l33&rAnd when they were come unto a place
    called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, &l34&rThey gave him vinegar
    to drink mingled'
  '6': 'with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. &l35&rAnd they
    crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled
    which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon
    my vesture did they'
  '7': cast lots. &l36&rAnd sitting down they watched him there; &l37&rAnd set up over his head his accusation written, This Is Jesus The King Of The Jews. &l38&rThen were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.
  '8': '&l39&rAnd they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, &l40&rAnd
    saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself.
    If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. &l41&rLikewise also the chief
    priests'
  '9': mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, &l42&rHe saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. &l43&rHe trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have
  '10': 'him: for he said, I am the Son of God. &l44&rThe thieves also, which were
    crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. &l45&rNow from the sixth hour
    there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. &l46&rAnd about the
    ninth hour Jesus cried'
  '11': with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? &l47&rSome of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. &l48&rAnd straightway one of them ran, and took a
  '12': spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. &l49&rThe rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. &l50&rJesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. &l51&rAnd, behold,
  '13': the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; &l52&rAnd the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, &l53&rAnd came out of the graves after his resurrection,
  '14': and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. &l54&rNow when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. &l55&rAnd many
  '15': 'women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering
    unto him: &l56&rAmong which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and
    Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children. &l57&rWhen the even was come, there
    came a rich'
  '16': 'man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus'' disciple: &l58&rHe
    went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to
    be delivered. &l59&rAnd when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
    linen cloth,'
  '17': '&l60&rAnd laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock:
    and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. &l61&rAnd
    there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
    &l62&rNow the next'
  '18': day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, &l63&rSaying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. &l64&rCommand therefore that the
  '19': 'sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night,
    and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the
    last error shall be worse than the first. &l65&rPilate said unto them, Ye have
    a watch: go your'
  '20': way, make it as sure as ye can. &l66&rSo they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
  '21': 'Chapter 28/nIn the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first
    day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
    &l2&rAnd, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended
    from heaven, and'
  '22': 'came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. &l3&rHis countenance
    was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: &l4&rAnd for fear of him the
    keepers did shake, and became as dead men. &l5&rAnd the angel answered and said
    unto the'
  '23': 'women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. &l6&rHe
    is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
    &l7&rAnd go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and,
    behold, he'
  '24': 'goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
    &l8&rAnd they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and
    did run to bring his disciples word. &l9&rAnd as they went to tell his disciples,
    behold, Jesus met'
  '25': 'them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped
    him. &l10&rThen said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that
    they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. &l11&rNow when they were going,
    behold, some of'
  '26': the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. &l12&rAnd when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, &l13&rSaying, Say ye, His disciples came by
  '27': 'night, and stole him away while we slept. &l14&rAnd if this come to the governor''s
    ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. &l15&rSo they took the money, and
    did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until
    this day.'
  '28': '&l16&rThen the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where
    Jesus had appointed them. &l17&rAnd when they saw him, they worshipped him: but
    some doubted. &l18&rAnd Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given
    unto me in'
  '29': 'heaven and in earth. &l19&rGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing
    them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: &l20&rTeaching
    them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with
    you always,'
  '30': even unto the end of the world. Amen.
