  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham,
    Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
    &l2&rHear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the
    Lord'
  '2': God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. &l3&rFor, behold, the Lord cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth. &l4&rAnd the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be
  '3': cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place. &l5&rFor the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high
  '4': 'places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem? &l6&rTherefore I will make Samaria
    as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down
    the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.
    &l7&rAnd all the'
  '5': 'graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof
    shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate:
    for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire
    of an harlot.'
  '6': '&l8&rTherefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will
    make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls. &l9&rFor her wound
    is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people,
    even to Jerusalem.'
  '7': '&l10&rDeclare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah
    roll thyself in the dust. &l11&rPass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having
    thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel;
    he shall'
  '8': 'receive of you his standing. &l12&rFor the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully
    for good: but evil came down from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem. &l13&rO
    thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning
    of the sin'
  '9': 'to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
    &l14&rTherefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib
    shall be a lie to the kings of Israel. &l15&rYet will I bring an heir unto thee,
    O inhabitant of'
  '10': 'Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel. &l16&rMake thee
    bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle;
    for they are gone into captivity from thee.'
  '11': 'Chapter 2

    Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning
    is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. &l2&rAnd
    they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away:
    so they'
  '12': 'oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. &l3&rTherefore
    thus saith the Lord; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which
    ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is
    evil. &l4&rIn that day'
  '13': 'shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation,
    and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how
    hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields. &l5&rTherefore
    thou shalt'
  '14': 'have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the Lord.
    &l6&rProphesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy
    to them, that they shall not take shame. &l7&rO thou that art named the house
    of Jacob, is the spirit of'
  '15': 'the Lord straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him
    that walketh uprightly? &l8&rEven of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye
    pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse
    from war. &l9&rThe'
  '16': 'women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their
    children have ye taken away my glory for ever. &l10&rArise ye, and depart; for
    this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with
    a sore destruction.'
  '17': '&l11&rIf a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will
    prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of
    this people. &l12&rI will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely
    gather the remnant of'
  '18': 'Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in
    the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude
    of men. &l13&rThe breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have
    passed through the'
  '19': 'gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and
    the Lord on the head of them.'
  '20': 'Chapter 3

    And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of
    Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment? &l2&rWho hate the good, and love the
    evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;'
  '21': '&l3&rWho also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them;
    and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh
    within the caldron. &l4&rThen shall they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear
    them: he will'
  '22': even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings. &l5&rThus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths,
  '23': they even prepare war against him. &l6&rTherefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. &l7&rThen
  '24': 'shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall
    all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God. &l8&rBut truly I am full
    of power by the spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of might, to declare
    unto Jacob his'
  '25': transgression, and to Israel his sin. &l9&rHear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. &l10&rThey build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. &l11&rThe
  '26': 'heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and
    the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say,
    Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. &l12&rTherefore shall Zion
    for your sake be'
  '27': plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
  '28': 'Chapter 4

    But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of
    the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted
    above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. &l2&rAnd many nations shall come,
    and'
  '29': 'say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house
    of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
    paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
    &l3&rAnd he shall'
  '30': 'judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall
    beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation
    shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
    &l4&rBut they shall'
  '31': 'sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make
    them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it. &l5&rFor all people
    will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the
    Lord our God for'
  '32': 'ever and ever. &l6&rIn that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble her that
    halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;
    &l7&rAnd I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off
    a strong nation: and'
  '33': the Lord shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever. &l8&rAnd thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of
  '34': 'Jerusalem. &l9&rNow why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee?
    is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail. &l10&rBe
    in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail:
    for now shalt'
  '35': thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the Lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies. &l11&rNow also many nations are gathered against thee, that
  '36': 'say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. &l12&rBut they know
    not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall
    gather them as the sheaves into the floor. &l13&rArise and thresh, O daughter
    of Zion: for I will'
  '37': 'make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat
    in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their
    substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.'
  '38': 'Chapter 5

    Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against
    us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. &l2&rBut thou,
    Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out
    of'
  '39': 'thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings
    forth have been from of old, from everlasting. &l3&rTherefore will he give them
    up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant
    of his brethren'
  '40': 'shall return unto the children of Israel. &l4&rAnd he shall stand and feed
    in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God; and
    they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. &l5&rAnd
    this man shall be'
  '41': 'the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall
    tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight
    principal men. &l6&rAnd they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and
    the land of Nimrod in'
  '42': 'the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he
    cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders. &l7&rAnd the remnant
    of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the Lord, as the showers
    upon the'
  '43': 'grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. &l8&rAnd
    the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as
    a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep:
    who, if he go'
  '44': through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. &l9&rThine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off. &l10&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut off
  '45': 'thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots: &l11&rAnd
    I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds: &l12&rAnd
    I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers:'
  '46': '&l13&rThy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out
    of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.
    &l14&rAnd I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy
    thy cities. &l15&rAnd I'
  '47': will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.
  '48': 'Chapter 6

    Hear ye now what the Lord saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and
    let the hills hear thy voice. &l2&rHear ye, O mountains, the Lord''s controversy,
    and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with his'
  '49': people, and he will plead with Israel. &l3&rO my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. &l4&rFor I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before
  '50': thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. &l5&rO my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the Lord.

  '1': 'Chapter 6 Cont.

    &l6&rWherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God?
    shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? &l7&rWill
    the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers'
  '2': of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? &l8&rHe hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
  '3': 'God? &l9&rThe Lord''s voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall
    see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. &l10&rAre there yet
    the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure
    that is abominable?'
  '4': '&l11&rShall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of
    deceitful weights? &l12&rFor the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the
    inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
    &l13&rTherefore'
  '5': also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins. &l14&rThou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and that which thou
  '6': deliverest will I give up to the sword. &l15&rThou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine. &l16&rFor the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the
  '7': 'works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make
    thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall
    bear the reproach of my people.'
  '8': 'Chapter 7

    Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings
    of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.
    &l2&rThe good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright'
  '9': 'among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother
    with a net. &l3&rThat they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh,
    and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous
    desire: so'

    now shall be their perplexity. &l5&rTrust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence
    in a guide: keep'
  '11': the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. &l6&rFor the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house. &l7&rTherefore I will
  '12': 'look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will

    she be trodden down as the mire of the streets. &l11&rIn the day that thy walls

  '16': 'their doings. &l14&rFeed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage,
    which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan

    of the land'

    mouth, their ears shall be deaf. &l17&rThey shall lick the dust like a serpent,
    they shall move out of'
