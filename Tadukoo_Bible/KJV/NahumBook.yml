  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. &l2&rGod
    is jealous, and the Lord revengeth; the Lord revengeth, and is furious; the Lord
    will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.'
  '2': '&l3&rThe Lord is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit
    the wicked: the Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds
    are the dust of his feet. &l4&rHe rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth
    up all the'
  '3': 'rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
    &l5&rThe mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at
    his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. &l6&rWho can stand before
    his'
  '4': indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him. &l7&rThe Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. &l8&rBut with an
  '5': 'overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness
    shall pursue his enemies. &l9&rWhat do ye imagine against the Lord? he will make
    an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time. &l10&rFor while they
    be folden'
  '6': together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry. &l11&rThere is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the Lord, a wicked counsellor. &l12&rThus saith the Lord; Though they be quiet, and
  '7': likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more. &l13&rFor now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder. &l14&rAnd the Lord hath given a
  '8': 'commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the
    house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will
    make thy grave; for thou art vile. &l15&rBehold upon the mountains the feet of
    him that bringeth good'
  '9': 'tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy
    vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.'
  '10': 'Chapter 2

    He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch
    the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily. &l2&rFor the Lord
    hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the
    emptiers'
  '11': 'have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches. &l3&rThe shield of
    his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall
    be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall
    be terribly shaken.'
  '12': '&l4&rThe chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against
    another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the
    lightnings. &l5&rHe shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk;
    they shall make'
  '13': haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared. &l6&rThe gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved. &l7&rAnd Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the
  '14': 'voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts. &l8&rBut Nineveh is of old like
    a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none
    shall look back. &l9&rTake ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for
    there is none end'
  '15': 'of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture. &l10&rShe is empty,
    and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and
    much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness. &l11&rWhere
    is the dwelling'
  '16': of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid? &l12&rThe lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his
  '17': 'holes with prey, and his dens with ravin. &l13&rBehold, I am against thee,
    saith the Lord of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword
    shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and
    the voice of thy'
  '18': messengers shall no more be heard.
  '19': 'Chapter 3

    Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departeth
    not; &l2&rThe noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and
    of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots. &l3&rThe horseman lifteth
    up both'
  '20': 'the bright sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain,
    and a great number of carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble
    upon their corpses: &l4&rBecause of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured'
  '21': harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts. &l5&rBehold, I am against thee, saith the Lord of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy
  '22': nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame. &l6&rAnd I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock. &l7&rAnd it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid
  '23': 'waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee? &l8&rArt
    thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the
    waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?
    &l9&rEthiopia and'
  '24': 'Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
    &l10&rYet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also
    were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her
    honourable men,'
  '25': 'and all her great men were bound in chains. &l11&rThou also shalt be drunken:
    thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy. &l12&rAll
    thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken,
    they shall'
  '26': 'even fall into the mouth of the eater. &l13&rBehold, thy people in the midst
    of thee are women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies:
    the fire shall devour thy bars. &l14&rDraw thee waters for the siege, fortify
    thy strong holds:'
  '27': 'go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln. &l15&rThere
    shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up
    like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as
    the locusts. &l16&rThou'
  '28': 'hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth,
    and fleeth away. &l17&rThy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the
    great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun
    ariseth they'
  '29': 'flee away, and their place is not known where they are. &l18&rThy shepherds
    slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell in the dust: thy people is
    scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth them. &l19&rThere is no healing
    of thy bruise; thy'
  '30': 'wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over
    thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?'
