    The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu,
    in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, &l2&rThat Hanani, one of
    my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the'
  '2': 'Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
    &l3&rAnd they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in
    the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also
    is broken down,'
  '3': and the gates thereof are burned with fire. &l4&rAnd it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, &l5&rAnd said, I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven, the
  '4': 'great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love
    him and observe his commandments: &l6&rLet thine ear now be attentive, and thine
    eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before
    thee now, day and'
  '5': 'night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the
    children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father''s
    house have sinned. &l7&rWe have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not
    kept the commandments,'
  '6': 'nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
    &l8&rRemember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses,
    saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations: &l9&rBut
    if ye turn unto'
  '7': me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there. &l10&rNow these are thy
  '8': 'servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by
    thy strong hand. &l11&rO Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive
    to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to
    fear thy name: and'
  '9': prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.
  '10': 'Chapter 2

    And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the
    king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king.
    Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence. &l2&rWherefore the king said'
  '11': 'unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing
    else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid, &l3&rAnd said unto the
    king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the
    city, the place of'
  '12': my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire? &l4&rThen the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven. &l5&rAnd I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant
  '13': have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it. &l6&rAnd the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou
  '14': return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. &l7&rMoreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah; &l8&rAnd a letter
  '15': unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to
  '16': the good hand of my God upon me. &l9&rThen I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. &l10&rWhen Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite,
  '17': heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. &l11&rSo I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. &l12&rAnd I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man
  '18': 'what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any
    beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon. &l13&rAnd I went out by night
    by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port,
    and viewed the walls of'
  '19': 'Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with
    fire. &l14&rThen I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king''s pool:
    but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass. &l15&rThen went
    I up in the night by'
  '20': the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned. &l16&rAnd the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to
  '21': 'the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work. &l17&rThen said I unto them,
    Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof
    are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we
    be no more a'
  '22': reproach. &l18&rThen I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work. &l19&rBut when Sanballat the
  '23': Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king? &l20&rThen answered I them, and said unto them, The God of
  '24': 'heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build:
    but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.'
  '25': 'Chapter 3

    Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they
    builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto
    the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel. &l2&rAnd next
    unto'
  '26': him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri. &l3&rBut the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. &l4&rAnd next
  '27': unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana. &l5&rAnd next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their
  '28': nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord. &l6&rMoreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars
  '29': thereof. &l7&rAnd next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river. &l8&rNext unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the
  '30': goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall. &l9&rAnd next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem. &l10&rAnd next unto
  '31': them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah. &l11&rMalchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.
  '32': '&l12&rAnd next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of
    the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters. &l13&rThe valley gate repaired
    Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof,
    the locks'
  '33': thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate. &l14&rBut the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars
  '34': thereof. &l15&rBut the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the
  '35': king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David. &l16&rAfter him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto
  '36': the house of the mighty. &l17&rAfter him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part. &l18&rAfter him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the
  '37': half part of Keilah. &l19&rAnd next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall. &l20&rAfter him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece,
  '38': from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. &l21&rAfter him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib.
  '39': '&l22&rAnd after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain. &l23&rAfter
    him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house. After him repaired
    Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his house. &l24&rAfter him repaired
    Binnui the son'
  '40': of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the corner. &l25&rPalal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that was by the court of
  '41': the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh. &l26&rMoreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out. &l27&rAfter them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the
  '42': great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel. &l28&rFrom above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house. &l29&rAfter them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the
  '43': son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate. &l30&rAfter him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber. &l31&rAfter him repaired
  '44': Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner. &l32&rAnd between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the
  '45': merchants.
  '46': 'Chapter 4

    But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was
    wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews. &l2&rAnd he spake before
    his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will
    they'
  '47': fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned? &l3&rNow Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he
  '48': 'shall even break down their stone wall. &l4&rHear, O our God; for we are
    despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey
    in the land of captivity: &l5&rAnd cover not their iniquity, and let not their
    sin be blotted out from'
  '49': 'before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders. &l6&rSo
    built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof:
    for the people had a mind to work. &l7&rBut it came to pass, that when Sanballat,
    and Tobiah, and'
  '50': the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,

    &l8&rAnd conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem,
    and to hinder it. &l9&rNevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a
    watch against them day and night, because of them. &l10&rAnd Judah said, The'
  '2': strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall. &l11&rAnd our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work
  '3': to cease. &l12&rAnd it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you. &l13&rTherefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the
  '4': 'higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords,
    their spears, and their bows. &l14&rAnd I looked, and rose up, and said unto the
    nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of
    them: remember the'
  '5': Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses. &l15&rAnd it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we
  '6': returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work. &l16&rAnd it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and
  '7': the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. &l17&rThey which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon. &l18&rFor the builders,
  '8': every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me. &l19&rAnd I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one
  '9': 'far from another. &l20&rIn what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
    resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us. &l21&rSo we laboured in
    the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till
    the stars'
  '10': appeared. &l22&rLikewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day. &l23&rSo neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men
  '11': of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.
  '12': 'Chapter 5

    And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren
    the Jews. &l2&rFor there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are
    many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live. &l3&rSome
    also'
  '13': there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth. &l4&rThere were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards. &l5&rYet now our
  '14': 'flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and,
    lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some
    of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power
    to redeem them; for'
  '15': other men have our lands and vineyards. &l6&rAnd I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. &l7&rThen I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a
  '16': great assembly against them. &l8&rAnd I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found
  '17': 'nothing to answer. &l9&rAlso I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye
    not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our
    enemies? &l10&rI likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them
    money and corn: I pray'
  '18': you, let us leave off this usury. &l11&rRestore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
  '19': '&l12&rThen said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them;
    so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them,
    that they should do according to this promise. &l13&rAlso I shook my lap, and
    said, So God'
  '20': shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the Lord. And the people did according to this promise. &l14&rMoreover from
  '21': the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. &l15&rBut the
  '22': 'former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people,
    and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even
    their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear
    of God. &l16&rYea,'
  '23': 'also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and
    all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. &l17&rMoreover there were
    at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came
    unto us from among the'
  '24': 'heathen that are about us. &l18&rNow that which was prepared for me daily
    was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in
    ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread
    of the governor, because'
  '25': the bondage was heavy upon this people. &l19&rThink upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.
  '26': 'Chapter 6

    Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the
    rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no
    breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the
    gates;)'
  '27': '&l2&rThat Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together
    in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
    &l3&rAnd I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that
    I cannot'
  '28': 'come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to
    you? &l4&rYet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them
    after the same manner. &l5&rThen sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner
    the fifth time with'
  '29': 'an open letter in his hand; &l6&rWherein was written, It is reported among
    the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which
    cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these
    words. &l7&rAnd'
  '30': 'thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying,
    There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to
    these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. &l8&rThen I
    sent unto him, saying,'
  '31': There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. &l9&rFor they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.
  '32': '&l10&rAfterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the
    son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house
    of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will
    come to slay thee;'
  '33': yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. &l11&rAnd I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. &l12&rAnd, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that
  '34': 'he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired
    him. &l13&rTherefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin,
    and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
    &l14&rMy God, think'
  '35': thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. &l15&rSo the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.
  '36': ' &l16&rAnd it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and
    all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down
    in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. &l17&rMoreover
    in those days'
  '37': the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. &l18&rFor there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of
  '38': Meshullam the son of Berechiah. &l19&rAlso they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
  '39': 'Chapter 7

    Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and
    the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, &l2&rThat I gave my
    brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for
    he was'
  '40': 'a faithful man, and feared God above many. &l3&rAnd I said unto them, Let
    not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand
    by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants
    of Jerusalem, every'
  '41': 'one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house. &l4&rNow the
    city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were
    not builded. &l5&rAnd my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles,
    and the rulers, and'
  '42': the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein, &l6&rThese are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had
  '43': been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city; &l7&rWho came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth,
  '44': Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this; &l8&rThe children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two. &l9&rThe children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two. &l10&rThe children of Arah, six
  '45': hundred fifty and two. &l11&rThe children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand and eight hundred and eighteen. &l12&rThe children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four. &l13&rThe children of Zattu, eight hundred forty

  '16': and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver. &l72&rAnd that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments. &l73&rSo the priests, and the Levites, and
  '17': the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.
  '18': 'Chapter 8

    And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that
    was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book
    of the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel. &l2&rAnd Ezra the
    priest'
  '19': brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. &l3&rAnd he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday,
  '20': before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law. &l4&rAnd Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood
  '21': Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam. &l5&rAnd Ezra opened the book in the sight of all
  '22': 'the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all
    the people stood up: &l6&rAnd Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God. And all the
    people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their
    heads, and worshipped'
  '23': 'the Lord with their faces to the ground. &l7&rAlso Jeshua, and Bani, and
    Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad,
    Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and
    the people stood in'
  '24': their place. &l8&rSo they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading. &l9&rAnd Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said
  '25': unto all the people, This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. &l10&rThen he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for
  '26': 'whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be
    ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your strength. &l11&rSo the Levites stilled
    all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.
    &l12&rAnd all the'
  '27': people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them. &l13&rAnd on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people,
  '28': the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law. &l14&rAnd they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh
  '29': 'month: &l15&rAnd that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities,
    and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and
    pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees,
    to make booths,'
  '30': as it is written. &l16&rSo the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the
  '31': 'gate of Ephraim. &l17&rAnd all the congregation of them that were come again
    out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days
    of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so.
    And there was very'
  '32': great gladness. &l18&rAlso day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.
  '33': 'Chapter 9

    Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled
    with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them. &l2&rAnd the seed of
    Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their
    sins,'
  '34': and the iniquities of their fathers. &l3&rAnd they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the Lord their God. &l4&rThen stood up upon
  '35': the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the Lord their God. &l5&rThen the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and
  '36': 'Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the Lord your God for ever and ever:
    and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
    &l6&rThou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens,
    with all their'
  '37': host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee. &l7&rThou art the Lord the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the
  '38': Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham; &l8&rAnd foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to
  '39': 'give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:
    &l9&rAnd didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their
    cry by the Red sea; &l10&rAnd shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on
    all his servants,'
  '40': 'and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly
    against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day. &l11&rAnd thou
    didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea
    on the dry land; and'
  '41': their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters. &l12&rMoreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go. &l13&rThou camest
  '42': 'down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest
    them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: &l14&rAnd
    madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes,
    and laws, by the hand'
  '43': 'of Moses thy servant: &l15&rAnd gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger,
    and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst
    them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give
    them.'
  '44': '&l16&rBut they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and
    hearkened not to thy commandments, &l17&rAnd refused to obey, neither were mindful
    of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their
    rebellion'
  '45': 'appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready
    to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest
    them not. &l18&rYea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is
    thy God that'
  '46': 'brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; &l19&rYet
    thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar
    of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the
    pillar of fire by'
  '47': night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go. &l20&rThou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. &l21&rYea, forty years didst thou sustain them
  '48': 'in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old,
    and their feet swelled not. &l22&rMoreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations,
    and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the
    land of the king'
  '49': of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. &l23&rTheir children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it. &l24&rSo the
  '50': children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.

    all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance:
    so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in'
  '2': thy great goodness. &l26&rNevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations. &l27&rTherefore thou

    of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers:
    also the'
  '4': 'priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian. &l23&rThe sons of Levi, the chief
    of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days
    of Johanan the son of Eliashib. &l24&rAnd the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah,
    Sherebiah, and'
  '5': Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward. &l25&rMattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters
  '6': keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates. &l26&rThese were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe. &l27&rAnd at the dedication of the wall of
  '7': Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. &l28&rAnd the sons of the singers gathered
  '8': 'themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem,
    and from the villages of Netophathi; &l29&rAlso from the house of Gilgal, and
    out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages
    round about Jerusalem.'
  '9': ' &l30&rAnd the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the
    people, and the gates, and the wall. &l31&rThen I brought up the princes of Judah
    upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof
    one went on'
  '10': 'the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate: &l32&rAnd after them went
    Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, &l33&rAnd Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
    &l34&rJudah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, &l35&rAnd certain of the
    priests'' sons'
  '11': 'with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah,
    the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:
    &l36&rAnd his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel,
    and Judah, Hanani,'
  '12': with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them. &l37&rAnd at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even
  '13': unto the water gate eastward. &l38&rAnd the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall; &l39&rAnd from above the
  '14': 'gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the
    tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood
    still in the prison gate. &l40&rSo stood the two companies of them that gave thanks
    in the house of'
  '15': 'God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me: &l41&rAnd the priests; Eliakim,
    Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
    &l42&rAnd Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah,
    and Elam,'
  '16': 'and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. &l43&rAlso
    that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice
    with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem
    was'
  '17': heard even afar off. &l44&rAnd at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and
  '18': 'Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
    &l45&rAnd both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the
    ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon
    his son. &l46&rFor'
  '19': in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God. &l47&rAnd all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day
  '20': 'his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites
    sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.'
  '21': 'Chapter 13

    On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and
    therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into
    the congregation of God for ever; &l2&rBecause they met not the children of Israel'
  '22': 'with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should
    curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing. &l3&rNow it came
    to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the
    mixed multitude. &l4&rAnd'
  '23': 'before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of
    the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah: &l5&rAnd he had prepared for him
    a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense,
    and the vessels, and'
  '24': 'the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to
    be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of
    the priests. &l6&rBut in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two
    and thirtieth year of'
  '25': 'Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained
    I leave of the king: &l7&rAnd I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil
    that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the
    house of God.'
  '26': '&l8&rAnd it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff
    to Tobiah out of the chamber. &l9&rThen I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers:
    and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering
    and the'
  '27': 'frankincense. &l10&rAnd I perceived that the portions of the Levites had
    not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were
    fled every one to his field. &l11&rThen contended I with the rulers, and said,
    Why is the house of God'
  '28': forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. &l12&rThen brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries. &l13&rAnd I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the
  '29': 'scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of
    Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office
    was to distribute unto their brethren. &l14&rRemember me, O my God, concerning
    this, and wipe not out'
  '30': my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof. &l15&rIn those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of
  '31': 'burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified
    against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. &l16&rThere dwelt men of Tyre
    also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath
    unto the'
  '32': children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. &l17&rThen I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? &l18&rDid not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and
  '33': upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath. &l19&rAnd it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be
  '34': 'opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates,
    that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. &l20&rSo the merchants
    and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. &l21&rThen
    I testified'
  '35': against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. &l22&rAnd I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should
  '36': 'come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God,
    concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy. &l23&rIn
    those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of
    Moab: &l24&rAnd'
  '37': their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people. &l25&rAnd I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made
  '38': them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves. &l26&rDid not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was
  '39': 'beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even
    him did outlandish women cause to sin. &l27&rShall we then hearken unto you to
    do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?
    &l28&rAnd one of'
  '40': 'the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to
    Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me. &l29&rRemember them, O
    my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood,
    and of the'
  '41': Levites. &l30&rThus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business; &l31&rAnd for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
