    Chapter 3

    These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the Lord spake
    with Moses in mount Sinai. &l2&rAnd these are the names of the sons of Aaron;
    Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. &l3&rThese are'
  '2': the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office. &l4&rAnd Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord, when they offered strange fire before the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had
  '3': 'no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest''s office in
    the sight of Aaron their father. &l5&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l6&rBring
    the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may
    minister unto'
  '4': him. &l7&rAnd they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle. &l8&rAnd they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the
  '5': 'charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. &l9&rAnd
    thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given
    unto him out of the children of Israel. &l10&rAnd thou shalt appoint Aaron and
    his sons, and they'
  '6': 'shall wait on their priest''s office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall
    be put to death. &l11&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l12&rAnd I, behold,
    I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the
    firstborn that'
  '7': 'openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall
    be mine; &l13&rBecause all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote
    all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in
    Israel, both man and'
  '8': 'beast: mine shall they be: I am the Lord. &l14&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses
    in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, &l15&rNumber the children of Levi after the
    house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward
    shalt thou'
  '9': number them. &l16&rAnd Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord, as he was commanded. &l17&rAnd these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. &l18&rAnd these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their
  '10': families; Libni, and Shimei. &l19&rAnd the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel. &l20&rAnd the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to the house of their
  '11': 'fathers. &l21&rOf Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family
    of the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites. &l22&rThose that were
    numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and
    upward, even those'
  '12': that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred. &l23&rThe families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward. &l24&rAnd the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.
  '13': '&l25&rAnd the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation
    shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for
    the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, &l26&rAnd the hangings of the
    court, and the'
  '14': curtain for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof. &l27&rAnd of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the
  '15': 'Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the
    Kohathites. &l28&rIn the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,
    were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary. &l29&rThe

  '18': 'that keep the charge of the sanctuary. &l33&rOf Merari was the family of
    the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.
    &l34&rAnd those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the

  '21': their pins, and their cords. &l38&rBut those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the
  '22': children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. &l39&rAll that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the Lord, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward,
  '23': were twenty and two thousand. &l40&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. &l41&rAnd thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the Lord)
  '24': instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel. &l42&rAnd Moses numbered, as the Lord commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of
  '25': Israel. &l43&rAnd all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. &l44&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
  '26': '&l45&rTake the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of
    Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites
    shall be mine: I am the Lord. &l46&rAnd for those that are to be redeemed of the
    two hundred and'
  '27': 'threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which
    are more than the Levites; &l47&rThou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the
    poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty
    gerahs:)'
  '28': '&l48&rAnd thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is
    to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons. &l49&rAnd Moses took the redemption
    money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites:
    &l50&rOf the firstborn'
  '29': 'of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and
    threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: &l51&rAnd Moses

  '31': 'Chapter 4

  '40': 'a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because

    And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of
    the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, &l2&rLet
    the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season. &l3&rIn
    the'
  '11': 'fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed
    season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies
    thereof, shall ye keep it. &l4&rAnd Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that
    they should keep the'
  '12': 'passover. &l5&rAnd they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
    month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the Lord commanded
    Moses, so did the children of Israel. &l6&rAnd there were certain men, who were
    defiled by the'
  '13': 'dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and
    they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: &l7&rAnd those men said unto
    him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that
    we may not offer an'
  '14': offering of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel? &l8&rAnd Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you. &l9&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l10&rSpeak unto the children of
  '15': Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the Lord. &l11&rThe fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it
  '16': 'with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. &l12&rThey shall leave none of it
    unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of
    the passover they shall keep it. &l13&rBut the man that is clean, and is not in
    a journey, and'
  '17': 'forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from
    among his people: because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed
    season, that man shall bear his sin. &l14&rAnd if a stranger shall sojourn among
    you, and will keep'

    according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance,
    both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land. &l15&rAnd on the
    day that the tabernacle'

    of'
  '20': 'fire by night. &l17&rAnd when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle,
    then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud
    abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. &l18&rAt the commandment
    of the Lord the'
  '21': 'children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched:
    as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. &l19&rAnd
    when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of
    Israel kept'

  '23': 'it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud
    was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by

    go forward. &l6&rWhen ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie
    on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their
    journeys. &l7&rBut'
  '29': when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. &l8&rAnd the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.
  '30': '&l9&rAnd if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you,
    then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before

  '33': 'cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran. &l13&rAnd they first took their
    journey according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses. &l14&rIn

  '35': 'tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari

    camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over
    his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud. &l23&rAnd over the host of the tribe
    of the children of'

  '39': 'throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
    &l26&rAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son
    of Ocran. &l27&rAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was
    Ahira the son of'
  '40': Enan. &l28&rThus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward. &l29&rAnd Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord
  '41': 'said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for
    the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel. &l30&rAnd he said unto him, I will

  '43': ' &l33&rAnd they departed from the mount of the Lord three days'' journey:

    to search out a resting place for them. &l34&rAnd the cloud of the Lord was upon
    them by day, when'
  '44': they went out of the camp. &l35&rAnd it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee. &l36&rAnd when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the

    &l13&rAnd Moses said unto the Lord, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou
    broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) &l14&rAnd they will tell
    it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou Lord art'
  '2': among this people, that thou Lord art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. &l15&rNow if thou shalt kill all this people as one man,
  '3': then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, &l16&rBecause the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. &l17&rAnd now, I beseech thee, let the
  '4': power of my lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, &l18&rThe Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto
  '5': the third and fourth generation. &l19&rPardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. &l20&rAnd the Lord said, I have pardoned according to
  '6': 'thy word: &l21&rBut as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with
    the glory of the Lord. &l22&rBecause all those men which have seen my glory, and
    my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now
    these ten times,'
  '7': 'and have not hearkened to my voice; &l23&rSurely they shall not see the land
    which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see
    it: &l24&rBut my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath
    followed me'
  '8': fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. &l25&r(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. &l26&rAnd the Lord
  '9': spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, &l27&rHow long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. &l28&rSay unto them, As truly as I live, saith
  '10': 'the Lord, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: &l29&rYour
    carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according
    to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against
    me.'
  '11': '&l30&rDoubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware
    to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son
    of Nun. &l31&rBut your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will
    I bring in, and they'
  '12': shall know the land which ye have despised. &l32&rBut as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. &l33&rAnd your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the
  '13': wilderness. &l34&rAfter the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. &l35&rI the Lord have said, I will surely do it
  '14': 'unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in
    this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. &l36&rAnd the
    men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation
    to murmur'
  '15': against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, &l37&rEven those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the Lord. &l38&rBut Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went
  '16': 'to search the land, lived still. &l39&rAnd Moses told these sayings unto
    all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. &l40&rAnd they rose
    up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying,
    Lo, we be here, and will'
  '17': 'go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised: for we have sinned. &l41&rAnd
    Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the Lord? but it
    shall not prosper. &l42&rGo not up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye be
    not smitten before'
  '18': 'your enemies. &l43&rFor the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before
    you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the Lord,
    therefore the Lord will not be with you. &l44&rBut they presumed to go up unto
    the hill top:'
  '19': nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. &l45&rThen the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.

    And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rSpeak unto the children of Israel,

  '21': 'or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your
    solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the Lord, of the herd or of the flock:
    &l4&rThen shall he that offereth his offering unto the Lord bring a meat offering
    of a tenth deal of'
  '22': flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil. &l5&rAnd the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb. &l6&rOr for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
  '23': deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil. &l7&rAnd for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the Lord. &l8&rAnd when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice
  '24': 'in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the Lord: &l9&rThen shall he
    bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with
    half an hin of oil. &l10&rAnd thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin
    of wine, for an'
  '25': offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord. &l11&rThus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. &l12&rAccording to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
  '26': '&l13&rAll that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner,
    in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord. &l14&rAnd
    if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations,
    and will offer'
  '27': 'an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord; as ye do, so he
    shall do. &l15&rOne ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also
    for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations:
    as ye are, so'
  '28': shall the stranger be before the Lord. &l16&rOne law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. &l17&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l18&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into
  '29': 'the land whither I bring you, &l19&rThen it shall be, that, when ye eat of
    the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the Lord. &l20&rYe
    shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye
    do the heave'

  '31': Moses, &l23&rEven all that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the Lord commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; &l24&rThen it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the
  '32': congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the Lord, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering. &l25&rAnd
  '33': 'the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children
    of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall
    bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord, and their sin offering
    before the Lord,'
  '34': 'for their ignorance: &l26&rAnd it shall be forgiven all the congregation
    of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing
    all the people were in ignorance. &l27&rAnd if any soul sin through ignorance,
    then he shall bring a she'
  '35': goat of the first year for a sin offering. &l28&rAnd the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him. &l29&rYe shall have one
  '36': law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them. &l30&rBut the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same
  '37': reproacheth the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. &l31&rBecause he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him. &l32&rAnd while the
  '38': children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. &l33&rAnd they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. &l34&rAnd they put him in ward, because
  '39': 'it was not declared what should be done to him. &l35&rAnd the Lord said unto
    Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone
    him with stones without the camp. &l36&rAnd all the congregation brought him without
    the camp, and'
  '40': stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l37&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l38&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations,
  '41': 'and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: &l39&rAnd
    it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all
    the commandments of the Lord, and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own
    heart and your own'
  '42': 'eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring: &l40&rThat ye may remember, and
    do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. &l41&rI am the Lord your God,
    which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your

    and was buried there. &l2&rAnd there was no water for the congregation: and they'

  '27': '&l11&rAnd Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice:

  '28': the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. &l13&rThis is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the Lord, and he was sanctified in them. &l14&rAnd
  '29': 'Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother
    Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: &l15&rHow our fathers

    from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. &l23&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses and

  '40': 'indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their
    cities. &l3&rAnd the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the
    Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the

    to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because
    of the way. &l5&rAnd the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
    have ye brought'
  '42': us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. &l6&rAnd the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.

    said unto Moses, Make'

    that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. &l9&rAnd Moses
    made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if
    a serpent had bitten'
  '45': any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. &l10&rAnd the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. &l11&rAnd they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.
  '46': '&l12&rFrom thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. &l13&rFrom

    me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. &l35&rAnd the

  '31': thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. &l36&rAnd when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast. &l37&rAnd Balak said unto
  '32': 'Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest

    said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any
    thing? the word'
  '33': that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. &l39&rAnd Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth. &l40&rAnd Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. &l41&rAnd it came to pass on the
  '34': morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.

  '38': '&l7&rAnd he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought

    from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
    reckoned among the nations. &l10&rWho can count the dust of Jacob, and the number
    of the fourth part'
  '40': of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his! &l11&rAnd Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether. &l12&rAnd he answered and
  '41': 'said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in my mouth?

    of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock
    and a ram on every altar. &l15&rAnd he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt
    offering, while I'
  '43': meet the Lord yonder. &l16&rAnd the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus. &l17&rAnd when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him,
  '44': 'What hath the Lord spoken? &l18&rAnd he took up his parable, and said, Rise
    up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: &l19&rGod is not a man,

    And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he went not, as
    at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
    &l2&rAnd Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in'
  '2': 'his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.
    &l3&rAnd he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and

    And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the
    daughters of Moab. &l2&rAnd they called the people unto the sacrifices of their
    gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. &l3&rAnd Israel joined'

    be turned away from'

  '19': of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l7&rAnd when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a
  '20': javelin in his hand; &l8&rAnd he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. &l9&rAnd those that died in the plague
  '21': were twenty and four thousand. &l10&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l11&rPhinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed
  '22': 'not the children of Israel in my jealousy. &l12&rWherefore say, Behold, I
    give unto him my covenant of peace: &l13&rAnd he shall have it, and his seed after
    him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for
    his God, and made'
  '23': an atonement for the children of Israel. &l14&rNow the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites. &l15&rAnd the name of the Midianitish
  '24': 'woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people,
    and of a chief house in Midian. &l16&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l17&rVex
    the Midianites, and smite them: &l18&rFor they vex you with their wiles, wherewith
    they'
  '25': have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.

    And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel,
    saying, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded. &l2&rIf a man vow a vow
    unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break
    his'
  '15': word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. &l3&rIf a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth; &l4&rAnd her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound
  '16': her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. &l5&rBut if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds
  '17': 'wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the Lord shall forgive
    her, because her father disallowed her. &l6&rAnd if she had at all an husband,
    when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;
    &l7&rAnd her husband'
  '18': 'heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her
    vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. &l8&rBut
    if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make
    her vow which she'
  '19': 'vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her
    soul, of none effect: and the Lord shall forgive her. &l9&rBut every vow of a
    widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall
    stand against her.'
  '20': '&l10&rAnd if she vowed in her husband''s house, or bound her soul by a bond
    with an oath; &l11&rAnd her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed
    her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her
    soul shall'
  '21': 'stand. &l12&rBut if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
    heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or
    concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void;
    and the Lord shall'
  '22': forgive her. &l13&rEvery vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. &l14&rBut if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all
  '23': 'her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace
    at her in the day that he heard them. &l15&rBut if he shall any ways make them
    void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity. &l16&rThese
    are the statutes,'

  '25': 'Chapter 31

    And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rAvenge the children of Israel of the
    Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people. &l3&rAnd Moses spake
    unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go'
  '26': against the Midianites, and avenge the Lord of Midian. &l4&rOf every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war. &l5&rSo there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand
  '27': armed for war. &l6&rAnd Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand. &l7&rAnd they warred against the Midianites, as the
  '28': 'Lord commanded Moses; and they slew all the males. &l8&rAnd they slew the
    kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem,
    and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor
    they slew with the'
  '29': sword. &l9&rAnd the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. &l10&rAnd they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their
  '30': goodly castles, with fire. &l11&rAnd they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts. &l12&rAnd they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of
  '31': Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho. &l13&rAnd Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. &l14&rAnd Moses was wroth with the officers of the
  '32': host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle. &l15&rAnd Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? &l16&rBehold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit
  '33': trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord. &l17&rNow therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. &l18&rBut all the women
  '34': 'children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
    &l19&rAnd do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person,
    and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives
    on the'
  '35': third day, and on the seventh day. &l20&rAnd purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood. &l21&rAnd Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the
  '36': 'ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses; &l22&rOnly the gold,
    and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, &l23&rEvery thing
    that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be
    clean: nevertheless it'
  '37': 'shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not
    the fire ye shall make go through the water. &l24&rAnd ye shall wash your clothes
    on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the
    camp. &l25&rAnd the'
  '38': 'Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l26&rTake the sum of the prey that was taken,
    both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers
    of the congregation: &l27&rAnd divide the prey into two parts; between them that
    took the war upon'
  '39': 'them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation: &l28&rAnd
    levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul
    of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and
    of the sheep:'
  '40': '&l29&rTake it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an
    heave offering of the Lord. &l30&rAnd of the children of Israel''s half, thou
    shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses,
    and of the flocks, of all'
  '41': manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord. &l31&rAnd Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses. &l32&rAnd the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught,
  '42': was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, &l33&rAnd threescore and twelve thousand beeves, &l34&rAnd threescore and one thousand asses, &l35&rAnd thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying
  '43': 'with him. &l36&rAnd the half, which was the portion of them that went out
    to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and
    five hundred sheep: &l37&rAnd the Lord''s tribute of the sheep was six hundred
    and threescore and'

  '45': sixteen thousand; of which the Lord'S tribute was thirty and two persons. &l41&rAnd Moses gave the tribute, which was the Lord'S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses. &l42&rAnd of the children of Israel's half, which Moses
  '46': divided from the men that warred, &l43&r(Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep, &l44&rAnd thirty and six thousand beeves, &l45&rAnd thirty thousand asses
  '47': and five hundred, &l46&rAnd sixteen thousand persons;) &l47&rEven of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord; as the Lord

    Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude

    behold, the place was a place for cattle; &l2&rThe children of Gad and the children

    &l6&rAnd'
  '6': Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here? &l7&rAnd wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them?
  '7': '&l8&rThus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the
    land. &l9&rFor when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land,
    they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go
    into the land which the'
  '8': Lord had given them. &l10&rAnd the Lord'S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying, &l11&rSurely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto
  '9': 'Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: &l12&rSave Caleb the son
    of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed
    the Lord. &l13&rAnd the Lord''S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
    them wander in the'
  '10': wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the Lord, was consumed. &l14&rAnd, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel.
  '11': '&l15&rFor if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in
    the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people. &l16&rAnd they came near
    unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for
    our little ones:'
  '12': '&l17&rBut we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel,
    until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in
    the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land. &l18&rWe will not return
    unto our houses,'
  '13': until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. &l19&rFor we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward. &l20&rAnd Moses said unto them, If ye
  '14': 'will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the Lord to war, &l21&rAnd
    will go all of you armed over Jordan before the Lord, until he hath driven out
    his enemies from before him, &l22&rAnd the land be subdued before the Lord: then
    afterward ye shall'
  '15': 'return, and be guiltless before the Lord, and before Israel; and this land
    shall be your possession before the Lord. &l23&rBut if ye will not do so, behold,
    ye have sinned against the Lord: and be sure your sin will find you out. &l24&rBuild
    you cities for'
  '16': your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. &l25&rAnd the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. &l26&rOur little ones, our wives,
  '17': 'our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead: &l27&rBut
    thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the Lord to battle,
    as my lord saith. &l28&rSo concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest,
    and Joshua the'
  '18': 'son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:

  '42': Dibongad. &l46&rAnd they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in Almondiblathaim. &l47&rAnd they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo. &l48&rAnd they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the
  '43': plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. &l49&rAnd they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab. &l50&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, &l51&rSpeak unto the children
  '44': of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan; &l52&rThen ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down
  '45': 'all their high places: &l53&rAnd ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the
    land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it. &l54&rAnd
    ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to
    the more ye shall'
  '46': 'give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance:
    every man''s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according
    to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit. &l55&rBut if ye will not drive
    out the'
  '47': inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. &l56&rMoreover it shall come to pass, that I
  '48': shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.
  '49': 'Chapter 34

    And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rCommand the children of Israel, and

    of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the'
  '15': Levites suburbs for the cities round about them. &l3&rAnd the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts. &l4&rAnd the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto
  '16': the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. &l5&rAnd ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand
  '17': 'cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be
    in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities. &l6&rAnd among
    the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for
    refuge, which ye shall'
  '18': 'appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall
    add forty and two cities. &l7&rSo all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites
    shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs. &l8&rAnd
    the cities which'

    them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give
    few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance
    which he'
  '20': inheriteth. &l9&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l10&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan; &l11&rThen ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer
  '21': may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares. &l12&rAnd they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment. &l13&rAnd of these cities which ye shall give six
  '22': cities shall ye have for refuge. &l14&rYe shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge. &l15&rThese six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for
  '23': 'the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth
    any person unawares may flee thither. &l16&rAnd if he smite him with an instrument

  '24': 'if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die,
    he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. &l18&rOr if he smite
    him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer:
    the murderer'
  '25': 'shall surely be put to death. &l19&rThe revenger of blood himself shall slay

    him with his'
  '26': 'hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he
    is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth

    any thing without laying'
  '27': 'of wait, &l23&rOr with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not,
    and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
    &l24&rThen the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of

    of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to
    the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the

  '30': 'revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood: &l28&rBecause
    he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high
    priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the
    land of his'
  '31': 'possession. &l29&rSo these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto
    you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. &l30&rWhoso killeth any
    person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one
    witness shall not testify'
  '32': 'against any person to cause him to die. &l31&rMoreover ye shall take no satisfaction

    city of his'
  '33': 'refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of
    the priest. &l33&rSo ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it
    defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein,
    but by the'
  '34': 'blood of him that shed it. &l34&rDefile not therefore the land which ye shall

  '35': 'Chapter 36

    And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir,
    the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake
    before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of'
  '36': 'Israel: &l2&rAnd they said, The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for
    an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by
    the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
    &l3&rAnd if they be'
  '37': 'married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel,
    then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and
    shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall
    it be taken from the'
  '38': 'lot of our inheritance. &l4&rAnd when the jubile of the children of Israel
    shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe
    whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the
    inheritance of the'
  '39': tribe of our fathers. &l5&rAnd Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well. &l6&rThis is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad,
  '40': 'saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the
    tribe of their father shall they marry. &l7&rSo shall not the inheritance of the
    children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of
    Israel shall keep'
  '41': himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. &l8&rAnd every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy
  '42': every man the inheritance of his fathers. &l9&rNeither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance. &l10&rEven as the Lord commanded Moses, so
  '43': 'did the daughters of Zelophehad: &l11&rFor Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and
    Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their fathers
    brothers'' sons: &l12&rAnd they were married into the families of the sons of
    Manasseh the son of'
  '44': Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. &l13&rThese are the commandments and the judgments, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
