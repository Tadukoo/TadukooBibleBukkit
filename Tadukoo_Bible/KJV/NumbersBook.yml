  '26': all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. &l47&rBut the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them. &l48&rFor the Lord had spoken unto Moses, saying, &l49&rOnly thou

    the Levites shall'
  '30': 'pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon
    the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge
    of the tabernacle of testimony. &l54&rAnd the children of Israel did according
    to all that the Lord'
  '31': commanded Moses, so did they.
  '32': 'Chapter 2/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, &l2&rEvery
    man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign

  '33': 'on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard

    shall be captain of the children of Judah. &l4&rAnd his host, and those that were

    that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar: and Nethaneel the

    shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. &l13&rAnd his host, and those that

    of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst
    of the camp: as'
  '41': 'they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by their standards.
    &l18&rOn the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according
    to their armies: and the captain of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the
    son of Ammihud.'
  '42': '&l19&rAnd his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty thousand

  '1': Chapter 3 Cont./nChapter 3/nThese also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the Lord spake with Moses in mount Sinai. &l2&rAnd these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. &l3&rThese are
  '2': the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office. &l4&rAnd Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord, when they offered strange fire before the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had
  '3': 'no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest''s office in
    the sight of Aaron their father. &l5&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l6&rBring
    the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may
    minister unto'
  '4': him. &l7&rAnd they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle. &l8&rAnd they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the
  '5': 'charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. &l9&rAnd
    thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given
    unto him out of the children of Israel. &l10&rAnd thou shalt appoint Aaron and
    his sons, and they'
  '6': 'shall wait on their priest''s office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall
    be put to death. &l11&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l12&rAnd I, behold,
    I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the
    firstborn that'
  '7': 'openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall
    be mine; &l13&rBecause all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote
    all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in
    Israel, both man and'
  '8': 'beast: mine shall they be: I am the Lord. &l14&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses
    in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, &l15&rNumber the children of Levi after the
    house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward
    shalt thou'
  '9': number them. &l16&rAnd Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord, as he was commanded. &l17&rAnd these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. &l18&rAnd these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their
  '10': families; Libni, and Shimei. &l19&rAnd the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel. &l20&rAnd the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to the house of their
  '11': 'fathers. &l21&rOf Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family
    of the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites. &l22&rThose that were
    numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and
    upward, even those'
  '12': that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred. &l23&rThe families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward. &l24&rAnd the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.
  '13': '&l25&rAnd the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation
    shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for
    the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, &l26&rAnd the hangings of the
    court, and the'
  '14': curtain for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof. &l27&rAnd of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the
  '15': 'Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the
    Kohathites. &l28&rIn the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,
    were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary. &l29&rThe
    families of the'
  '16': sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward. &l30&rAnd the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel. &l31&rAnd their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the
  '17': candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof. &l32&rAnd Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them
  '18': 'that keep the charge of the sanctuary. &l33&rOf Merari was the family of
    the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.
    &l34&rAnd those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the
    males, from a month old'
  '19': 'and upward, were six thousand and two hundred. &l35&rAnd the chief of the
    house of the father of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these
    shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward. &l36&rAnd under the custody
    and charge of the'
  '20': sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto, &l37&rAnd the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and
  '21': their pins, and their cords. &l38&rBut those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the
  '22': children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. &l39&rAll that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the Lord, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward,
  '23': were twenty and two thousand. &l40&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. &l41&rAnd thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the Lord)
  '24': instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel. &l42&rAnd Moses numbered, as the Lord commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of
  '25': Israel. &l43&rAnd all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. &l44&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
  '26': '&l45&rTake the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of
    Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites
    shall be mine: I am the Lord. &l46&rAnd for those that are to be redeemed of the
    two hundred and'
  '27': 'threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which
    are more than the Levites; &l47&rThou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the
    poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty
    gerahs:)'
  '28': '&l48&rAnd thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is
    to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons. &l49&rAnd Moses took the redemption
    money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites:
    &l50&rOf the firstborn'
  '29': 'of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and
    threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: &l51&rAnd Moses
    gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according
    to the word of the'
  '30': Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
  '31': Chapter 4/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, &l2&rTake the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers, &l3&rFrom thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all
  '32': 'that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.
    &l4&rThis shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the
    congregation, about the most holy things: &l5&rAnd when the camp setteth forward,
    Aaron shall'
  '33': 'come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover
    the ark of testimony with it: &l6&rAnd shall put thereon the covering of badgers''
    skins, and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves
    thereof.'
  '34': '&l7&rAnd upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and
    put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal:
    and the continual bread shall be thereon: &l8&rAnd they shall spread upon them
    a cloth of'
  '35': scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in the staves thereof. &l9&rAnd they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels
  '36': 'thereof, wherewith they minister unto it: &l10&rAnd they shall put it and
    all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers'' skins, and shall put it
    upon a bar. &l11&rAnd upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue,
    and cover it with a'
  '37': 'covering of badgers'' skins, and shall put to the staves thereof: &l12&rAnd
    they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they minister in the
    sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of
    badgers'' skins, and'
  '38': 'shall put them on a bar: &l13&rAnd they shall take away the ashes from the
    altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon: &l14&rAnd they shall put upon it all
    the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks,
    and the'
  '39': shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it. &l15&rAnd when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the
  '40': 'sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath
    shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die.
    These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.
    &l16&rAnd to'
  '41': the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the
  '42': 'vessels thereof. &l17&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,
    &l18&rCut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the
    Levites: &l19&rBut thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they
    approach unto the'
  '43': 'most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every
    one to his service and to his burden: &l20&rBut they shall not go in to see when
    the holy things are covered, lest they die. &l21&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses,
    saying, &l22&rTake'
  '44': also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families; &l23&rFrom thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle
  '45': 'of the congregation. &l24&rThis is the service of the families of the Gershonites,
    to serve, and for burdens: &l25&rAnd they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle,
    and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the
    badgers'''
  '46': skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, &l26&rAnd the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their
  '47': 'cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all that is made for
    them: so shall they serve. &l27&rAt the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall
    be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in
    all their service: and'
  '48': 'ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens. &l28&rThis is the
    service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation:
    and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
    &l29&rAs for'
  '49': the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their families, by the house of their fathers; &l30&rFrom thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of the

    the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and

  '2': and offer them for an offering. &l16&rFor they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me. &l17&rFor all the

  '6': Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. &l21&rAnd the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the Lord; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them. &l22&rAnd after that went the
  '7': 'Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before
    Aaron, and before his sons: as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites,
    so did they unto them. &l23&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l24&rThis

    the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou
    do unto the Levites touching their charge.'
  '10': Chapter 9/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, &l2&rLet the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season. &l3&rIn the
  '11': 'fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed
    season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies
    thereof, shall ye keep it. &l4&rAnd Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that
    they should keep the'
  '12': 'passover. &l5&rAnd they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
    month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the Lord commanded
    Moses, so did the children of Israel. &l6&rAnd there were certain men, who were
    defiled by the'
  '13': 'dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and
    they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: &l7&rAnd those men said unto
    him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that
    we may not offer an'
  '14': offering of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel? &l8&rAnd Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you. &l9&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l10&rSpeak unto the children of
  '15': Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the Lord. &l11&rThe fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it
  '16': 'with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. &l12&rThey shall leave none of it
    unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of
    the passover they shall keep it. &l13&rBut the man that is clean, and is not in
    a journey, and'
  '17': 'forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from
    among his people: because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed
    season, that man shall bear his sin. &l14&rAnd if a stranger shall sojourn among
    you, and will keep'
  '18': 'the passover unto the Lord; according to the ordinance of the passover, and
    according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance,
    both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land. &l15&rAnd on the
    day that the tabernacle'
  '19': 'was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony:
    and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until
    the morning. &l16&rSo it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance
    of'
  '20': 'fire by night. &l17&rAnd when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle,
    then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud
    abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. &l18&rAt the commandment
    of the Lord the'
  '21': 'children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched:
    as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. &l19&rAnd
    when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of
    Israel kept'
  '22': the charge of the Lord, and journeyed not. &l20&rAnd so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the Lord they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed. &l21&rAnd so
  '23': 'it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud
    was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by
    night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. &l22&rOr whether it were two
    days, or a month, or a'
  '24': 'year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the
    children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken
    up, they journeyed. &l23&rAt the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents,
    and at the'
  '25': 'commandment of the Lord they journeyed: they kept the charge of the Lord,
    at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.'
  '26': 'Chapter 10/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rMake thee two trumpets
    of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for
    the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps. &l3&rAnd when
    they shall blow'
  '27': with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l4&rAnd if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
  '28': '&l5&rWhen ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall
    go forward. &l6&rWhen ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie
    on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their
    journeys. &l7&rBut'
  '29': when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. &l8&rAnd the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.
  '30': '&l9&rAnd if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you,
    then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before
    the Lord your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies. &l10&rAlso in the
    day of your'
  '31': 'gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months,
    ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices
    of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God:
    I am the Lord your'
  '32': God. &l11&rAnd it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony. &l12&rAnd the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the
  '33': 'cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran. &l13&rAnd they first took their
    journey according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses. &l14&rIn
    the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according
    to their armies: and'
  '34': over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab. &l15&rAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar. &l16&rAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon. &l17&rAnd the
  '35': 'tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari
    set forward, bearing the tabernacle. &l18&rAnd the standard of the camp of Reuben
    set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of
    Shedeur. &l19&rAnd'
  '36': 'over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son
    of Zurishaddai. &l20&rAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was
    Eliasaph the son of Deuel. &l21&rAnd the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary:
    and the other'
  '37': 'did set up the tabernacle against they came. &l22&rAnd the standard of the
    camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over
    his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud. &l23&rAnd over the host of the tribe
    of the children of'
  '38': Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. &l24&rAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni. &l25&rAnd the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, which was the rereward of all the camps
  '39': 'throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
    &l26&rAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son
    of Ocran. &l27&rAnd over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was
    Ahira the son of'
  '40': Enan. &l28&rThus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward. &l29&rAnd Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord
  '41': 'said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for
    the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel. &l30&rAnd he said unto him, I will
    not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred. &l31&rAnd he said,
    Leave us not, I'
  '42': pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes. &l32&rAnd it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the Lord shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.
  '43': ' &l33&rAnd they departed from the mount of the Lord three days'' journey:
    and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days'' journey,
    to search out a resting place for them. &l34&rAnd the cloud of the Lord was upon
    them by day, when'
  '44': they went out of the camp. &l35&rAnd it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee. &l36&rAnd when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the
  '45': many thousands of Israel.
  '46': 'Chapter 11/nAnd when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the
    Lord heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the Lord burnt among
    them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp. &l2&rAnd
    the people cried unto'
  '47': 'Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire was quenched. &l3&rAnd
    he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the Lord burnt among
    them. &l4&rAnd the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the
    children of Israel'
  '48': 'also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? &l5&rWe remember
    the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and
    the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: &l6&rBut now our soul is dried away:
    there is nothing at'
  '49': all, beside this manna, before our eyes. &l7&rAnd the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium. &l8&rAnd the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and
  '50': 'made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. &l9&rAnd
    when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.'

  '10': sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? &l23&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Is the Lord'S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. &l24&rAnd Moses went out, and told the people the words of the
  '11': 'Lord, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them
    round about the tabernacle. &l25&rAnd the Lord came down in a cloud, and spake

    in the camp. &l27&rAnd there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad

  '15': he and the elders of Israel. &l31&rAnd there went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp,
  '16': 'and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth. &l32&rAnd the

  '21': 'came out. &l5&rAnd the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood

    &l10&rAnd the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became

    &l3&rAnd Moses by'

  '31': Gaddiel the son of Sodi. &l11&rOf the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. &l12&rOf the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. &l13&rOf the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. &l14&rOf the tribe of Naphtali,
  '32': Nahbi the son of Vophsi. &l15&rOf the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. &l16&rThese are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua. &l17&rAnd Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan,
  '33': 'and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:
    &l18&rAnd see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth therein, whether
    they be strong or weak, few or many; &l19&rAnd what the land is that they dwell

  '35': Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes. &l21&rSo they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. &l22&rAnd they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the
  '36': children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) &l23&rAnd they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the
  '37': pomegranates, and of the figs. &l24&rThe place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence. &l25&rAnd they returned from searching of the land after forty days. &l26&rAnd they went and
  '38': came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land. &l27&rAnd they told him, and
  '39': 'said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth
    with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. &l28&rNevertheless the people
    be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and
    moreover we saw the'
  '40': 'children of Anak there. &l29&rThe Amalekites dwell in the land of the south:
    and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains:
    and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. &l30&rAnd Caleb
    stilled the people'
  '41': before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. &l31&rBut the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we. &l32&rAnd they brought up an evil
  '42': report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature. &l33&rAnd
  '43': 'there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and
    we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.'
  '44': 'Chapter 14/nAnd all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and
    the people wept that night. &l2&rAnd all the children of Israel murmured against
    Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God
    that we had died in'
  '45': the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! &l3&rAnd wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? &l4&rAnd
  '46': they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. &l5&rThen Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. &l6&rAnd Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of
  '47': 'Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
    &l7&rAnd they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The
    land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land. &l8&rIf
    the Lord delight in us,'
  '48': 'then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth
    with milk and honey. &l9&rOnly rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye
    the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from
    them, and the Lord is'
  '49': 'with us: fear them not. &l10&rBut all the congregation bade stone them with
    stones. And the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation
    before all the children of Israel. &l11&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, How long
    will this people'
  '50': provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them? &l12&rI will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

  '2': among this people, that thou Lord art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. &l15&rNow if thou shalt kill all this people as one man,
  '3': then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, &l16&rBecause the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. &l17&rAnd now, I beseech thee, let the
  '4': power of my lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, &l18&rThe Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto
  '5': the third and fourth generation. &l19&rPardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. &l20&rAnd the Lord said, I have pardoned according to
  '6': 'thy word: &l21&rBut as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with
    the glory of the Lord. &l22&rBecause all those men which have seen my glory, and
    my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now
    these ten times,'
  '7': 'and have not hearkened to my voice; &l23&rSurely they shall not see the land
    which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see
    it: &l24&rBut my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath
    followed me'
  '8': fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. &l25&r(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. &l26&rAnd the Lord
  '9': spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, &l27&rHow long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. &l28&rSay unto them, As truly as I live, saith
  '10': 'the Lord, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: &l29&rYour
    carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according
    to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against
    me.'
  '11': '&l30&rDoubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware
    to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son
    of Nun. &l31&rBut your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will
    I bring in, and they'
  '12': shall know the land which ye have despised. &l32&rBut as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. &l33&rAnd your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the
  '13': wilderness. &l34&rAfter the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. &l35&rI the Lord have said, I will surely do it
  '14': 'unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in
    this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. &l36&rAnd the
    men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation
    to murmur'
  '15': against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, &l37&rEven those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the Lord. &l38&rBut Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went
  '16': 'to search the land, lived still. &l39&rAnd Moses told these sayings unto
    all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. &l40&rAnd they rose
    up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying,
    Lo, we be here, and will'
  '17': 'go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised: for we have sinned. &l41&rAnd
    Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the Lord? but it
    shall not prosper. &l42&rGo not up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye be
    not smitten before'
  '18': 'your enemies. &l43&rFor the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before
    you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the Lord,
    therefore the Lord will not be with you. &l44&rBut they presumed to go up unto
    the hill top:'
  '19': nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. &l45&rThen the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.
  '20': Chapter 15/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, &l3&rAnd will make an offering by fire unto the Lord, a burnt offering,
  '21': 'or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your
    solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the Lord, of the herd or of the flock:
    &l4&rThen shall he that offereth his offering unto the Lord bring a meat offering
    of a tenth deal of'
  '22': flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil. &l5&rAnd the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb. &l6&rOr for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
  '23': deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil. &l7&rAnd for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the Lord. &l8&rAnd when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice
  '24': 'in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the Lord: &l9&rThen shall he
    bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with
    half an hin of oil. &l10&rAnd thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin
    of wine, for an'
  '25': offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord. &l11&rThus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. &l12&rAccording to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
  '26': '&l13&rAll that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner,
    in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord. &l14&rAnd
    if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations,
    and will offer'
  '27': 'an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord; as ye do, so he
    shall do. &l15&rOne ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also
    for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations:
    as ye are, so'
  '28': shall the stranger be before the Lord. &l16&rOne law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. &l17&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l18&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into
  '29': 'the land whither I bring you, &l19&rThen it shall be, that, when ye eat of
    the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the Lord. &l20&rYe
    shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye
    do the heave'
  '30': offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it. &l21&rOf the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Lord an heave offering in your generations. &l22&rAnd if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the Lord hath spoken unto
  '31': Moses, &l23&rEven all that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the Lord commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; &l24&rThen it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the
  '32': congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the Lord, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering. &l25&rAnd
  '33': 'the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children
    of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall
    bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord, and their sin offering
    before the Lord,'
  '34': 'for their ignorance: &l26&rAnd it shall be forgiven all the congregation
    of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing
    all the people were in ignorance. &l27&rAnd if any soul sin through ignorance,
    then he shall bring a she'
  '35': goat of the first year for a sin offering. &l28&rAnd the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him. &l29&rYe shall have one
  '36': law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them. &l30&rBut the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same
  '37': reproacheth the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. &l31&rBecause he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him. &l32&rAnd while the
  '38': children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. &l33&rAnd they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. &l34&rAnd they put him in ward, because
  '39': 'it was not declared what should be done to him. &l35&rAnd the Lord said unto
    Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone
    him with stones without the camp. &l36&rAnd all the congregation brought him without
    the camp, and'
  '40': stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses. &l37&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l38&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations,
  '41': 'and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: &l39&rAnd
    it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all
    the commandments of the Lord, and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own
    heart and your own'
  '42': 'eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring: &l40&rThat ye may remember, and
    do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. &l41&rI am the Lord your God,
    which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your
    God.'

    a small thing unto you,'
  '48': that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them? &l10&rAnd he hath brought thee near to him,

  '2': ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the Lord'S heave offering to Aaron the priest. &l29&rOut of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the Lord, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
  '3': '&l30&rTherefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof
    from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor,
    and as the increase of the winepress. &l31&rAnd ye shall eat it in every place,
    ye and'
  '4': 'your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle
    of the congregation. &l32&rAnd ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have
    heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the
    children of Israel,'
  '5': lest ye die.
  '6': Chapter 19/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, &l2&rThis is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and
  '7': 'upon which never came yoke: &l3&rAnd ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest,
    that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his
    face: &l4&rAnd Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and
    sprinkle of her'
  '8': 'blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times: &l5&rAnd
    one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood,
    with her dung, shall he burn: &l6&rAnd the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop,
    and scarlet,'
  '9': and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. &l7&rThen the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. &l8&rAnd he that burneth
  '10': her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. &l9&rAnd a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the
  '11': 'congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a
    purification for sin. &l10&rAnd he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall
    wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children
    of Israel, and unto'
  '12': 'the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. &l11&rHe
    that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days. &l12&rHe shall
    purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean:
    but if he purify'
  '13': 'not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. &l13&rWhosoever
    toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth
    the tabernacle of the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because
    the'
  '14': 'water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his
    uncleanness is yet upon him. &l14&rThis is the law, when a man dieth in a tent:
    all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven
    days. &l15&rAnd every'
  '15': open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean. &l16&rAnd whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. &l17&rAnd for an unclean person they
  '16': 'shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and
    running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: &l18&rAnd a clean person shall
    take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon
    all the vessels, and upon'
  '17': 'the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain,
    or one dead, or a grave: &l19&rAnd the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean
    on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify
    himself, and'
  '18': 'wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.
    &l20&rBut the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul
    shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary
    of the Lord: the'
  '19': water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. &l21&rAnd it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean
  '20': until even. &l22&rAnd whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.
  '21': 'Chapter 20/nThen came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
    into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and
    Miriam died there, and was buried there. &l2&rAnd there was no water for the congregation:
    and they'
  '22': gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. &l3&rAnd the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord! &l4&rAnd why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this
  '23': wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? &l5&rAnd wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
  '24': '&l6&rAnd Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the
    door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and
    the glory of the Lord appeared unto them. &l7&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses,
    saying, &l8&rTake the'
  '25': 'rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother,
    and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water,
    and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the
    congregation and'
  '26': their beasts drink. &l9&rAnd Moses took the rod from before the Lord, as he commanded him. &l10&rAnd Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
  '27': '&l11&rAnd Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice:
    and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts
    also. &l12&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not,
    to sanctify me in'
  '28': the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. &l13&rThis is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the Lord, and he was sanctified in them. &l14&rAnd
  '29': 'Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother
    Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: &l15&rHow our fathers
    went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians
    vexed us, and'
  '30': 'our fathers: &l16&rAnd when we cried unto the Lord, he heard our voice, and
    sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in
    Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: &l17&rLet us pass, I pray thee,
    through thy country: we'
  '31': 'will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will
    we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king''s high way, we will
    not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
    &l18&rAnd Edom said unto'
  '32': 'him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
    &l19&rAnd the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and
    if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without
    doing anything'
  '33': 'else, go through on my feet. &l20&rAnd he said, Thou shalt not go through.
    And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. &l21&rThus
    Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned
    away from him.'
  '34': '&l22&rAnd the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed
    from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. &l23&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses and
    Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying, &l24&rAaron shall
    be gathered unto his'
  '35': 'people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the
    children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
    &l25&rTake Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: &l26&rAnd
    strip Aaron of his'
  '36': 'garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered
    unto his people, and shall die there. &l27&rAnd Moses did as the Lord commanded:
    and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. &l28&rAnd
    Moses stripped Aaron'
  '37': 'of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there
    in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. &l29&rAnd
    when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty
    days, even all the'
  '38': house of Israel.
  '39': Chapter 21/nAnd when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners. &l2&rAnd Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt
  '40': 'indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their
    cities. &l3&rAnd the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the
    Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the
    name of the place'
  '41': 'Hormah. &l4&rAnd they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea,
    to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because
    of the way. &l5&rAnd the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
    have ye brought'
  '42': us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. &l6&rAnd the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
  '43': '&l7&rTherefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we
    have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take
    away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. &l8&rAnd the Lord
    said unto Moses, Make'
  '44': 'thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass,
    that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. &l9&rAnd Moses
    made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if
    a serpent had bitten'
  '45': any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. &l10&rAnd the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. &l11&rAnd they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.
  '46': '&l12&rFrom thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. &l13&rFrom
    thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness
    that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab,
    between'
  '47': Moab and the Amorites. &l14&rWherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, &l15&rAnd at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
  '48': '&l16&rAnd from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the Lord
    spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water. &l17&rThen
    Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it: &l18&rThe princes digged
    the well,'
  '49': 'the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with
    their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah: &l19&rAnd from Mattanah
    to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: &l20&rAnd from Bamoth in the valley,
    that is in the'
  '50': country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon. &l21&rAnd Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

  '1': 'Chapter 21 Cont./n&l22&rLet me pass through thy land: we will not turn into
    the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well:
    but we will go along by the king''s high way, until we be past thy borders. &l23&rAnd
    Sihon would not'
  '2': 'suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people
    together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz,
    and fought against Israel. &l24&rAnd Israel smote him with the edge of the sword,
    and possessed his'
  '3': 'land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border
    of the children of Ammon was strong. &l25&rAnd Israel took all these cities: and
    Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages
    thereof.'
  '4': '&l26&rFor Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had
    fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand,
    even unto Arnon. &l27&rWherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
    let the city of'
  '5': 'Sihon be built and prepared: &l28&rFor there is a fire gone out of Heshbon,
    a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed ar of Moab, and the lords of
    the high places of Arnon. &l29&rWoe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of
    Chemosh: he hath given'
  '6': his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites. &l30&rWe have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba. &l31&rThus Israel dwelt in
  '7': 'the land of the Amorites. &l32&rAnd Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they
    took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there. &l33&rAnd
    they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and og the king of bashan went out
    against them, he,'
  '8': 'and all his people, to the battle at edrei. &l34&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses,
    Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and
    his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
    which dwelt at'
  '9': 'Heshbon. &l35&rSo they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until
    there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.'
  '10': Chapter 22/nAnd the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho. &l2&rAnd Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. &l3&rAnd Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they
  '11': 'were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. &l4&rAnd
    Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are
    round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son
    of Zippor was'
  '12': 'king of the Moabites at that time. &l5&rHe sent messengers therefore unto
    Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children
    of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt:
    behold, they'
  '13': 'cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: &l6&rCome now
    therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me:
    peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them
    out of the land: for I'
  '14': wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. &l7&rAnd the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.
  '15': '&l8&rAnd he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word
    again, as the Lord shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
    &l9&rAnd God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee? &l10&rAnd
    Balaam said'
  '16': 'unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,
    &l11&rBehold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of
    the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them,
    and drive them out.'
  '17': ' &l12&rAnd God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt
    not curse the people: for they are blessed. &l13&rAnd Balaam rose up in the morning,
    and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the Lord refuseth
    to give me leave'
  '18': to go with you. &l14&rAnd the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. &l15&rAnd Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. &l16&rAnd they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus
  '19': 'saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from
    coming unto me: &l17&rFor I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will
    do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this
    people. &l18&rAnd'
  '20': Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to do less or more. &l19&rNow therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may
  '21': know what the Lord will say unto me more. &l20&rAnd God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do. &l21&rAnd Balaam rose up in the
  '22': 'morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. &l22&rAnd
    God''s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the Lord stood in the
    way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two
    servants were with him.'
  '23': ' &l23&rAnd the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his
    sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into
    the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. &l24&rBut the angel
    of the Lord stood'
  '24': 'in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that
    side. &l25&rAnd when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she thrust herself unto
    the wall, and crushed Balaam''s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
    &l26&rAnd the angel of'
  '25': 'the Lord went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn
    either to the right hand or to the left. &l27&rAnd when the ass saw the angel
    of the Lord, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam''s anger was kindled, and
    he smote the ass with a'
  '26': 'staff. &l28&rAnd the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
    Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
    &l29&rAnd Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there
    were a sword in mine'
  '27': hand, for now would I kill thee. &l30&rAnd the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay. &l31&rThen the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam,
  '28': 'and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawn
    in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face. &l32&rAnd
    the angel of the Lord said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these
    three times? behold, I'
  '29': 'went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me: &l33&rAnd
    the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from
    me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive. &l34&rAnd Balaam said
    unto the angel of'
  '30': 'the Lord, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against
    me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. &l35&rAnd the
    angel of the Lord said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I
    shall speak unto'
  '31': thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. &l36&rAnd when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast. &l37&rAnd Balak said unto
  '32': 'Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest
    thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour? &l38&rAnd Balaam
    said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any
    thing? the word'
  '33': that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. &l39&rAnd Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth. &l40&rAnd Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. &l41&rAnd it came to pass on the
  '34': morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.
  '35': Chapter 23/nAnd Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. &l2&rAnd Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. &l3&rAnd Balaam said unto Balak,
  '36': 'Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the Lord will come
    to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high
    place. &l4&rAnd God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars,
    and I have'
  '37': offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram. &l5&rAnd the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. &l6&rAnd he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
  '38': '&l7&rAnd he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought
    me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob,
    and come, defy Israel. &l8&rHow shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how
    shall I defy, whom'
  '39': 'the Lord hath not defied? &l9&rFor from the top of the rocks I see him, and
    from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
    reckoned among the nations. &l10&rWho can count the dust of Jacob, and the number
    of the fourth part'
  '40': of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his! &l11&rAnd Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether. &l12&rAnd he answered and
  '41': 'said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in my mouth?
    &l13&rAnd Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place,
    from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them,
    and shalt not see them'
  '42': 'all: and curse me them from thence. &l14&rAnd he brought him into the field
    of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock
    and a ram on every altar. &l15&rAnd he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt
    offering, while I'
  '43': meet the Lord yonder. &l16&rAnd the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus. &l17&rAnd when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him,
  '44': 'What hath the Lord spoken? &l18&rAnd he took up his parable, and said, Rise
    up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: &l19&rGod is not a man,
    that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said,
    and shall he not'
  '45': 'do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? &l20&rBehold, I
    have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse
    it. &l21&rHe hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness
    in Israel: the Lord his'
  '46': 'God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them. &l22&rGod brought
    them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn. &l23&rSurely
    there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against
    Israel: according to'
  '47': 'this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
    &l24&rBehold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as
    a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood
    of the slain.'
  '48': '&l25&rAnd Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them
    at all. &l26&rBut Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying,
    All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do? &l27&rAnd Balak said unto Balaam,
    Come, I pray thee, I'
  '49': will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. &l28&rAnd Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward jeshimon. &l29&rAnd Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars,
  '50': and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. &l30&rAnd Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.

  '1': Chapter 24 Cont./nChapter 24/nAnd when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. &l2&rAnd Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding
  '2': 'in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.
    &l3&rAnd he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and
    the man whose eyes are open hath said: &l4&rHe hath said, which heard the words
    of God, which saw'
  '3': 'the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
    &l5&rHow goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel! &l6&rAs
    the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river''s side, as the trees
    of lign aloes which'
  '4': the Lord hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters. &l7&rHe shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted. &l8&rGod brought him forth out of
  '5': 'Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the
    nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with
    his arrows. &l9&rHe couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall
    stir him up? Blessed'
  '6': 'is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee. &l10&rAnd Balak''s
    anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said
    unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether
    blessed'
  '7': 'them these three times. &l11&rTherefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought
    to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from
    honour. &l12&rAnd Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which
    thou sentest unto'
  '8': 'me, saying, &l13&rIf Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold,
    I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord, to do either good or bad of mine
    own mind; but what the Lord saith, that will I speak? &l14&rAnd now, behold, I
    go unto my people:'
  '9': 'come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy
    people in the latter days. &l15&rAnd he took up his parable, and said, Balaam
    the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: &l16&rHe
    hath said, which heard'
  '10': 'the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the
    vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: &l17&rI
    shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come
    a Star out of Jacob,'
  '11': and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. &l18&rAnd Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly. &l19&rOut of Jacob
  '12': shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city. &l20&rAnd when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.
  '13': '&l21&rAnd he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong
    is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock. &l22&rNevertheless
    the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive. &l23&rAnd
    he took up his'
  '14': parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this! &l24&rAnd ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever. &l25&rAnd Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his
  '15': 'place: and Balak also went his way.'
  '16': 'Chapter 25/nAnd Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom
    with the daughters of Moab. &l2&rAnd they called the people unto the sacrifices
    of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. &l3&rAnd
    Israel joined'
  '17': 'himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.
    &l4&rAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang
    them up before the Lord against the sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may
    be turned away from'
  '18': Israel. &l5&rAnd Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor. &l6&rAnd, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight
  '19': of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l7&rAnd when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a
  '20': javelin in his hand; &l8&rAnd he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. &l9&rAnd those that died in the plague
  '21': were twenty and four thousand. &l10&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l11&rPhinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed
  '22': 'not the children of Israel in my jealousy. &l12&rWherefore say, Behold, I
    give unto him my covenant of peace: &l13&rAnd he shall have it, and his seed after
    him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for
    his God, and made'
  '23': an atonement for the children of Israel. &l14&rNow the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites. &l15&rAnd the name of the Midianitish
  '24': 'woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people,
    and of a chief house in Midian. &l16&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l17&rVex
    the Midianites, and smite them: &l18&rFor they vex you with their wiles, wherewith
    they'
  '25': have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.
  '26': Chapter 26/nAnd it came to pass after the plague, that the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, &l2&rTake the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their
  '27': fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel. &l3&rAnd Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, &l4&rTake the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the Lord commanded
  '28': 'Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt.

  '14': Chapter 30/nAnd Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded. &l2&rIf a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break
  '15': his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. &l3&rIf a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth; &l4&rAnd her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath
  '16': bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. &l5&rBut if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds
  '17': 'wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the Lord shall forgive
    her, because her father disallowed her. &l6&rAnd if she had at all an husband,
    when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;
    &l7&rAnd her husband'
  '18': 'heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her
    vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. &l8&rBut
    if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make
    her vow which she'
  '19': 'vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her
    soul, of none effect: and the Lord shall forgive her. &l9&rBut every vow of a
    widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall
    stand against her.'
  '20': '&l10&rAnd if she vowed in her husband''s house, or bound her soul by a bond
    with an oath; &l11&rAnd her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed
    her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her
    soul shall'
  '21': 'stand. &l12&rBut if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
    heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or
    concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void;
    and the Lord shall'
  '22': forgive her. &l13&rEvery vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. &l14&rBut if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all
  '23': 'her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace
    at her in the day that he heard them. &l15&rBut if he shall any ways make them
    void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity. &l16&rThese
    are the statutes,'
  '24': which the Lord commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.
  '25': 'Chapter 31/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rAvenge the children
    of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
    &l3&rAnd Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the
    war, and let them go'
  '26': against the Midianites, and avenge the Lord of Midian. &l4&rOf every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war. &l5&rSo there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand
  '27': armed for war. &l6&rAnd Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand. &l7&rAnd they warred against the Midianites, as the
  '28': 'Lord commanded Moses; and they slew all the males. &l8&rAnd they slew the
    kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem,
    and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor
    they slew with the'
  '29': sword. &l9&rAnd the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. &l10&rAnd they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their
  '30': goodly castles, with fire. &l11&rAnd they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts. &l12&rAnd they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of
  '31': Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho. &l13&rAnd Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. &l14&rAnd Moses was wroth with the officers of the
  '32': host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle. &l15&rAnd Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? &l16&rBehold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit
  '33': trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord. &l17&rNow therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. &l18&rBut all the women
  '34': 'children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
    &l19&rAnd do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person,
    and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives
    on the'
  '35': third day, and on the seventh day. &l20&rAnd purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood. &l21&rAnd Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the
  '36': 'ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses; &l22&rOnly the gold,
    and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, &l23&rEvery thing
    that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be
    clean: nevertheless it'
  '37': 'shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not
    the fire ye shall make go through the water. &l24&rAnd ye shall wash your clothes
    on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the
    camp. &l25&rAnd the'
  '38': 'Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l26&rTake the sum of the prey that was taken,
    both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers
    of the congregation: &l27&rAnd divide the prey into two parts; between them that
    took the war upon'
  '39': 'them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation: &l28&rAnd
    levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul
    of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and
    of the sheep:'
  '40': '&l29&rTake it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an
    heave offering of the Lord. &l30&rAnd of the children of Israel''s half, thou
    shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses,
    and of the flocks, of all'
  '41': manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord. &l31&rAnd Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses. &l32&rAnd the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught,
  '42': was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, &l33&rAnd threescore and twelve thousand beeves, &l34&rAnd threescore and one thousand asses, &l35&rAnd thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying
  '43': 'with him. &l36&rAnd the half, which was the portion of them that went out
    to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and
    five hundred sheep: &l37&rAnd the Lord''s tribute of the sheep was six hundred
    and threescore and'
  '44': fifteen. &l38&rAnd the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the Lord'S tribute was threescore and twelve. &l39&rAnd the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the Lord'S tribute was threescore and one. &l40&rAnd the persons were
  '45': sixteen thousand; of which the Lord'S tribute was thirty and two persons. &l41&rAnd Moses gave the tribute, which was the Lord'S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses. &l42&rAnd of the children of Israel's half, which Moses
  '46': divided from the men that warred, &l43&r(Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep, &l44&rAnd thirty and six thousand beeves, &l45&rAnd thirty thousand asses
  '47': and five hundred, &l46&rAnd sixteen thousand persons;) &l47&rEven of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord; as the Lord
  '48': 'commanded Moses. &l48&rAnd the officers which were over thousands of the
    host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:
    &l49&rAnd they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of
    war which are under our'
  '49': charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. &l50&rWe have therefore brought an oblation for the Lord, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the Lord.

  '3': 'Chapter 32/nNow the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very
    great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of
    Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle; &l2&rThe children of Gad
    and the children of'
  '4': Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying, &l3&rAtaroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, &l4&rEven the country which the Lord
  '5': 'smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants
    have cattle: &l5&rWherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let
    this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.
    &l6&rAnd'
  '6': Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here? &l7&rAnd wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them?
  '7': '&l8&rThus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the
    land. &l9&rFor when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land,
    they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go
    into the land which the'
  '8': Lord had given them. &l10&rAnd the Lord'S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying, &l11&rSurely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto
  '9': 'Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: &l12&rSave Caleb the son
    of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed
    the Lord. &l13&rAnd the Lord''S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
    them wander in the'
  '10': wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the Lord, was consumed. &l14&rAnd, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel.
  '11': '&l15&rFor if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in
    the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people. &l16&rAnd they came near
    unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for
    our little ones:'
  '12': '&l17&rBut we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel,
    until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in
    the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land. &l18&rWe will not return
    unto our houses,'
  '13': until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. &l19&rFor we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward. &l20&rAnd Moses said unto them, If ye
  '14': 'will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the Lord to war, &l21&rAnd
    will go all of you armed over Jordan before the Lord, until he hath driven out
    his enemies from before him, &l22&rAnd the land be subdued before the Lord: then
    afterward ye shall'
  '15': 'return, and be guiltless before the Lord, and before Israel; and this land
    shall be your possession before the Lord. &l23&rBut if ye will not do so, behold,
    ye have sinned against the Lord: and be sure your sin will find you out. &l24&rBuild
    you cities for'
  '16': your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. &l25&rAnd the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. &l26&rOur little ones, our wives,
  '17': 'our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead: &l27&rBut
    thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the Lord to battle,
    as my lord saith. &l28&rSo concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest,
    and Joshua the'
  '18': 'son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
    &l29&rAnd Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben
    will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the Lord, and
    the land shall be'
  '19': 'subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
    &l30&rBut if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions
    among you in the land of Canaan. &l31&rAnd the children of Gad and the children
    of Reuben'
  '20': answered, saying, As the Lord hath said unto thy servants, so will we do. &l32&rWe will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be our's. &l33&rAnd Moses gave unto them, even
  '21': to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities
  '22': 'of the country round about. &l34&rAnd the children of Gad built Dibon, and
    Ataroth, and Aroer, &l35&rAnd Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah, &l36&rAnd
    Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep. &l37&rAnd the children
    of Reuben'
  '23': 'built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim, &l38&rAnd Nebo, and Baalmeon,
    (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities
    which they builded. &l39&rAnd the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went
    to Gilead, and took it,'
  '24': and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it. &l40&rAnd Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein. &l41&rAnd Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair. &l42&rAnd Nobah went and
  '25': took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
  '26': 'Chapter 33/nThese are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went
    forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
    &l2&rAnd Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment

  '36': they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah. &l28&rAnd they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah. &l29&rAnd they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah. &l30&rAnd they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth. &l31&rAnd they

  '39': '&l38&rAnd Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the

    every man''s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according
    to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit. &l55&rBut if ye will not drive
    out the'
  '47': inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. &l56&rMoreover it shall come to pass, that I
  '48': shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.
  '49': Chapter 34/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rCommand the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts

    &l13&rAnd Moses'

    inherit by lot, which the Lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to
    the half tribe: &l14&rFor the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the
    house of their fathers,'
  '7': 'and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers,
    have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received
    their inheritance: &l15&rThe two tribes and the half tribe have received their
    inheritance on this'
  '8': 'side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising. &l16&rAnd the Lord
    spake unto Moses, saying, &l17&rThese are the names of the men which shall divide
    the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. &l18&rAnd ye
    shall take one'
  '9': 'prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance. &l19&rAnd the names
    of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. &l20&rAnd
    of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud. &l21&rOf the
    tribe of'
  '10': Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. &l22&rAnd the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli. &l23&rThe prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod. &l24&rAnd the prince of
  '11': the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. &l25&rAnd the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach. &l26&rAnd the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan. &l27&rAnd
  '12': the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. &l28&rAnd the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud. &l29&rThese are they whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children
  '13': of Israel in the land of Canaan.
  '14': Chapter 35/nAnd the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, &l2&rCommand the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the
  '15': Levites suburbs for the cities round about them. &l3&rAnd the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts. &l4&rAnd the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto
  '16': the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. &l5&rAnd ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand
  '17': 'cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be
    in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities. &l6&rAnd among
    the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for
    refuge, which ye shall'
  '18': 'appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall
    add forty and two cities. &l7&rSo all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites
    shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs. &l8&rAnd
    the cities which'
  '19': 'ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from
    them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give
    few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance
    which he'
  '20': inheriteth. &l9&rAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, &l10&rSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan; &l11&rThen ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer
  '21': may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares. &l12&rAnd they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment. &l13&rAnd of these cities which ye shall give six
  '22': cities shall ye have for refuge. &l14&rYe shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge. &l15&rThese six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for
  '23': 'the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth
    any person unawares may flee thither. &l16&rAnd if he smite him with an instrument
    of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to
    death. &l17&rAnd'
  '24': 'if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die,
    he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. &l18&rOr if he smite
    him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer:
    the murderer'
  '25': 'shall surely be put to death. &l19&rThe revenger of blood himself shall slay
    the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him. &l20&rBut if he thrust him
    of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die; &l21&rOr in enmity smite
    him with his'
  '26': 'hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he
    is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth
    him. &l22&rBut if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him
    any thing without laying'
  '27': 'of wait, &l23&rOr with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not,
    and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
    &l24&rThen the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of
    blood according to'
  '28': 'these judgments: &l25&rAnd the congregation shall deliver the slayer out
    of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to
    the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the
    death of the high'
  '29': priest, which was anointed with the holy oil. &l26&rBut if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled; &l27&rAnd the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the
  '30': 'revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood: &l28&rBecause
    he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high
    priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the
    land of his'
  '31': 'possession. &l29&rSo these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto
    you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. &l30&rWhoso killeth any
    person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one
    witness shall not testify'
  '32': 'against any person to cause him to die. &l31&rMoreover ye shall take no satisfaction
    for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put
    to death. &l32&rAnd ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the
    city of his'
  '33': 'refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of
    the priest. &l33&rSo ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it
    defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein,
    but by the'
  '34': 'blood of him that shed it. &l34&rDefile not therefore the land which ye shall
    inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel.'
  '35': Chapter 36/nAnd the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of
  '36': 'Israel: &l2&rAnd they said, The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for
    an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by
    the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
    &l3&rAnd if they be'
  '37': 'married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel,
    then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and
    shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall
    it be taken from the'
  '38': 'lot of our inheritance. &l4&rAnd when the jubile of the children of Israel
    shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe
    whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the
    inheritance of the'
  '39': tribe of our fathers. &l5&rAnd Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well. &l6&rThis is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad,
  '40': 'saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the
    tribe of their father shall they marry. &l7&rSo shall not the inheritance of the
    children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of
    Israel shall keep'
  '41': himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. &l8&rAnd every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy
  '42': every man the inheritance of his fathers. &l9&rNeither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance. &l10&rEven as the Lord commanded Moses, so
  '43': 'did the daughters of Zelophehad: &l11&rFor Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and
    Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their fathers
    brothers'' sons: &l12&rAnd they were married into the families of the sons of
    Manasseh the son of'
  '44': Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. &l13&rThese are the commandments and the judgments, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
