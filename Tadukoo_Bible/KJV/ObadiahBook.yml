  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom; We have heard
    a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye,
    and let us rise up against her in battle. &l2&rBehold, I have made thee small
    among the'
  '2': 'heathen: thou art greatly despised. &l3&rThe pride of thine heart hath deceived
    thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high;
    that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? &l4&rThough thou
    exalt thyself as'
  '3': the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord. &l5&rIf thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came
  '4': 'to thee, would they not leave some grapes? &l6&rHow are the things of Esau
    searched out! how are his hidden things sought up! &l7&rAll the men of thy confederacy
    have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have
    deceived thee,'
  '5': 'and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under
    thee: there is none understanding in him. &l8&rShall I not in that day, saith
    the Lord, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the
    mount of Esau? &l9&rAnd'
  '6': thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter. &l10&rFor thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. &l11&rIn the day that thou
  '7': stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them. &l12&rBut thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy
  '8': brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress. &l13&rThou shouldest not have entered into the
  '9': gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity; &l14&rNeither shouldest thou have stood in the
  '10': 'crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou
    have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress. &l15&rFor
    the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall
    be done unto thee: thy'
  '11': reward shall return upon thine own head. &l16&rFor as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been. &l17&rBut upon mount
  '12': Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. &l18&rAnd the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them,
  '13': 'and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau;
    for the Lord hath spoken it. &l19&rAnd they of the south shall possess the mount
    of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields
    of Ephraim, and'
  '14': 'the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead. &l20&rAnd the captivity
    of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even
    unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess
    the'
  '15': cities of the south. &l21&rAnd saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord's.
