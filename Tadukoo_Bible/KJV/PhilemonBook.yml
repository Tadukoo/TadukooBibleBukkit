  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly
    beloved, and fellowlabourer, &l2&rAnd to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our
    fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: &l3&rGrace to you, and peace, from'
  '2': God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. &l4&rI thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, &l5&rHearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; &l6&rThat the communication of thy faith may
  '3': become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. &l7&rFor we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. &l8&rWherefore, though I might be much bold
  '4': 'in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, &l9&rYet for love''s sake
    I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner
    of Jesus Christ. &l10&rI beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten
    in my bonds:'
  '5': '&l11&rWhich in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee
    and to me: &l12&rWhom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
    mine own bowels: &l13&rWhom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he
    might have'
  '6': 'ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: &l14&rBut without thy mind
    would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but
    willingly. &l15&rFor perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest
    receive him for'
  '7': ever; &l16&rNot now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? &l17&rIf thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. &l18&rIf he hath wronged thee, or
  '8': 'oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; &l19&rI Paul have written it with
    mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto
    me even thine own self besides. &l20&rYea, brother, let me have joy of thee in
    the Lord: refresh'
  '9': 'my bowels in the Lord. &l21&rHaving confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto
    thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. &l22&rBut withal prepare
    me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto
    you. &l23&rThere'
  '10': salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; &l24&rMarcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. &l25&rThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
