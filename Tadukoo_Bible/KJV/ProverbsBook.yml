    The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; &l2&rTo know wisdom
    and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; &l3&rTo receive the instruction
    of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; &l4&rTo give subtilty to the'
  '2': 'simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. &l5&rA wise man will hear,
    and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise
    counsels: &l6&rTo understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the
    wise, and their'
  '3': 'dark sayings. &l7&rThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but
    fools despise wisdom and instruction. &l8&rMy son, hear the instruction of thy
    father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: &l9&rFor they shall be an ornament
    of grace unto thy'
  '4': 'head, and chains about thy neck. &l10&rMy son, if sinners entice thee, consent
    thou not. &l11&rIf they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk
    privily for the innocent without cause: &l12&rLet us swallow them up alive as
    the grave; and'
  '5': 'whole, as those that go down into the pit: &l13&rWe shall find all precious
    substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: &l14&rCast in thy lot among us;
    let us all have one purse: &l15&rMy son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain
    thy foot from'
  '6': 'their path: &l16&rFor their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
    &l17&rSurely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. &l18&rAnd they
    lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. &l19&rSo
    are the ways of every'
  '7': 'one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
    &l20&rWisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: &l21&rShe
    crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city
    she uttereth her'
  '8': 'words, saying, &l22&rHow long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and
    the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? &l23&rTurn you
    at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my
    words unto you.'
  '9': '&l24&rBecause I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand,
    and no man regarded; &l25&rBut ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would
    none of my reproof: &l26&rI also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when
    your fear cometh;'
  '10': '&l27&rWhen your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as
    a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. &l28&rThen shall they
    call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall
    not find me: &l29&rFor'
  '11': 'that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: &l30&rThey
    would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. &l31&rTherefore shall
    they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
    &l32&rFor the turning'
  '12': away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. &l33&rBut whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
  '13': 'Chapter 2

    My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; &l2&rSo
    that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;
    &l3&rYea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for'
  '14': 'understanding; &l4&rIf thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her
    as for hid treasures; &l5&rThen shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and
    find the knowledge of God. &l6&rFor the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh
    knowledge and'
  '15': 'understanding. &l7&rHe layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a
    buckler to them that walk uprightly. &l8&rHe keepeth the paths of judgment, and
    preserveth the way of his saints. &l9&rThen shalt thou understand righteousness,
    and judgment, and'
  '16': 'equity; yea, every good path. &l10&rWhen wisdom entereth into thine heart,
    and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; &l11&rDiscretion shall preserve thee,
    understanding shall keep thee: &l12&rTo deliver thee from the way of the evil
    man, from the man that'
  '17': 'speaketh froward things; &l13&rWho leave the paths of uprightness, to walk
    in the ways of darkness; &l14&rWho rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness
    of the wicked; &l15&rWhose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:
    &l16&rTo deliver'
  '18': thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; &l17&rWhich forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. &l18&rFor her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. &l19&rNone
  '19': that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. &l20&rThat thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. &l21&rFor the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
  '20': '&l22&rBut the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors
    shall be rooted out of it.'
  '21': 'Chapter 3

    My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: &l2&rFor
    length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. &l3&rLet not
    mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table
    of'
  '22': 'thine heart: &l4&rSo shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the
    sight of God and man. &l5&rTrust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not
    unto thine own understanding. &l6&rIn all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall
    direct thy paths.'
  '23': '&l7&rBe not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.
    &l8&rIt shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. &l9&rHonour the
    Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: &l10&rSo
    shall thy barns be'
  '24': 'filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. &l11&rMy
    son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction:
    &l12&rFor whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom
    he delighteth.'
  '25': '&l13&rHappy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.
    &l14&rFor the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and
    the gain thereof than fine gold. &l15&rShe is more precious than rubies: and all
    the things'
  '26': thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. &l16&rLength of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. &l17&rHer ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. &l18&rShe is a tree of life to them that lay hold
  '27': 'upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. &l19&rThe Lord by wisdom
    hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. &l20&rBy
    his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. &l21&rMy
    son, let not'
  '28': 'them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: &l22&rSo shall
    they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. &l23&rThen shalt thou walk
    in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. &l24&rWhen thou liest down,
    thou shalt not be'
  '29': 'afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. &l25&rBe
    not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
    &l26&rFor the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being
    taken.'
  '30': '&l27&rWithhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power
    of thine hand to do it. &l28&rSay not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again,
    and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. &l29&rDevise not evil against
    thy neighbour,'
  '31': 'seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. &l30&rStrive not with a man without
    cause, if he have done thee no harm. &l31&rEnvy thou not the oppressor, and choose
    none of his ways. &l32&rFor the froward is abomination to the Lord: but his secret
    is with the'
  '32': 'righteous. &l33&rThe curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but
    he blesseth the habitation of the just. &l34&rSurely he scorneth the scorners:
    but he giveth grace unto the lowly. &l35&rThe wise shall inherit glory: but shame
    shall be the'
  '33': promotion of fools.
  '34': 'Chapter 4

    Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
    &l2&rFor I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. &l3&rFor I was my father''s
    son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. &l4&rHe taught me also,'
  '35': 'and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments,
    and live. &l5&rGet wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from
    the words of my mouth. &l6&rForsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love
    her, and she shall'
  '36': 'keep thee. &l7&rWisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and
    with all thy getting get understanding. &l8&rExalt her, and she shall promote
    thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. &l9&rShe shall
    give to thine head an'
  '37': 'ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. &l10&rHear,
    O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. &l11&rI
    have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. &l12&rWhen
    thou goest, thy'
  '38': 'steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
    &l13&rTake fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy
    life. &l14&rEnter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil
    men. &l15&rAvoid'
  '39': it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. &l16&rFor they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. &l17&rFor they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. &l18&rBut
  '40': 'the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more
    unto the perfect day. &l19&rThe way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not
    at what they stumble. &l20&rMy son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto
    my sayings. &l21&rLet'
  '41': them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. &l22&rFor they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. &l23&rKeep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. &l24&rPut away from
  '42': thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. &l25&rLet thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. &l26&rPonder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. &l27&rTurn not to the right hand nor to
  '43': 'the left: remove thy foot from evil.'
  '44': 'Chapter 5

    My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding: &l2&rThat
    thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. &l3&rFor
    the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than
    oil:'
  '45': '&l4&rBut her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. &l5&rHer
    feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. &l6&rLest thou shouldest ponder
    the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. &l7&rHear
    me now'
  '46': 'therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. &l8&rRemove
    thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: &l9&rLest thou
    give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: &l10&rLest strangers
    be filled with'
  '47': thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; &l11&rAnd thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, &l12&rAnd say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; &l13&rAnd have not obeyed the voice of my
  '48': teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! &l14&rI was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. &l15&rDrink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. &l16&rLet thy fountains be
  '49': 'dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. &l17&rLet them be
    only thine own, and not strangers'' with thee. &l18&rLet thy fountain be blessed:
    and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. &l19&rLet her be as the loving hind and
    pleasant roe; let her'
  '50': breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. &l20&rAnd why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

    &l21&rFor the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all
    his goings. &l22&rHis own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall
    be holden with the cords of his sins. &l23&rHe shall die without instruction;'
  '2': and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
  '3': 'Chapter 6

    My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with
    a stranger, &l2&rThou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with
    the words of thy mouth. &l3&rDo this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou

    the hands to sleep: &l11&rSo shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and
    thy want as an armed man. &l12&rA naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a
    froward mouth.'
  '7': '&l13&rHe winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with

    shall he be broken'
  '8': 'without remedy. &l16&rThese six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are

    about thy neck.'
  '10': '&l22&rWhen thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep
    thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. &l23&rFor the commandment
    is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
    &l24&rTo keep'
  '11': 'thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
    &l25&rLust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with
    her eyelids. &l26&rFor by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece
    of bread: and the'
  '12': adultress will hunt for the precious life. &l27&rCan a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? &l28&rCan one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? &l29&rSo he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall
  '13': not be innocent. &l30&rMen do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; &l31&rBut if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. &l32&rBut whoso committeth adultery with a woman
  '14': 'lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. &l33&rA
    wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. &l34&rFor
    jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
    &l35&rHe will'

  '16': 'Chapter 7

    My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. &l2&rKeep my commandments,

    from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words. &l6&rFor
    at the window of my house I looked through my casement, &l7&rAnd beheld among
    the simple ones, I'
  '18': 'discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, &l8&rPassing
    through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, &l9&rIn
    the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: &l10&rAnd, behold,
    there met him a woman'
  '19': 'with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. &l11&r(She is loud and
    stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: &l12&rNow is she without, now in the
    streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) &l13&rSo she caught him, and kissed
    him, and with an'
  '20': impudent face said unto him, &l14&rI have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. &l15&rTherefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. &l16&rI have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with
  '21': 'carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. &l17&rI have perfumed my bed with
    myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. &l18&rCome, let us take our fill of love until the
    morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. &l19&rFor the goodman is not at home,
    he is gone a long'
  '22': 'journey: &l20&rHe hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home
    at the day appointed. &l21&rWith her much fair speech she caused him to yield,
    with the flattering of her lips she forced him. &l22&rHe goeth after her straightway,
    as an ox goeth to'
  '23': the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; &l23&rTill a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. &l24&rHearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of
  '24': 'my mouth. &l25&rLet not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in
    her paths. &l26&rFor she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have
    been slain by her. &l27&rHer house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers
    of death.'
  '25': 'Chapter 8

    Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? &l2&rShe standeth
    in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. &l3&rShe crieth
    at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. &l4&rUnto

  '26': 'O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. &l5&rO ye simple, understand

    speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. &l7&rFor
    my mouth'
  '27': shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. &l8&rAll the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them. &l9&rThey are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
  '28': '&l10&rReceive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice
    gold. &l11&rFor wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired
    are not to be compared to it. &l12&rI wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out
    knowledge of'
  '29': 'witty inventions. &l13&rThe fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and
    arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. &l14&rCounsel is

    &l20&rI lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:

    their treasures.'
  '32': '&l22&rThe Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works
    of old. &l23&rI was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth
    was. &l24&rWhen there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no
    fountains abounding'
  '33': 'with water. &l25&rBefore the mountains were settled, before the hills was
    I brought forth: &l26&rWhile as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
    nor the highest part of the dust of the world. &l27&rWhen he prepared the heavens,
    I was there: when he'
  '34': 'set a compass upon the face of the depth: &l28&rWhen he established the clouds
    above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: &l29&rWhen he gave to the
    sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed
    the'
  '35': 'foundations of the earth: &l30&rThen I was by him, as one brought up with
    him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; &l31&rRejoicing
    in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.
    &l32&rNow therefore'
  '36': 'hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways. &l33&rHear
    instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. &l34&rBlessed is the man that heareth
    me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. &l35&rFor whoso
    findeth'

    against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.'
  '38': 'Chapter 9

    Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: &l2&rShe hath
    killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
    &l3&rShe hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the'
  '39': 'city, &l4&rWhoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth
    understanding, she saith to him, &l5&rCome, eat of my bread, and drink of the
    wine which I have mingled. &l6&rForsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way
    of understanding.'
  '40': '&l7&rHe that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh
    a wicked man getteth himself a blot. &l8&rReprove not a scorner, lest he hate
    thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. &l9&rGive instruction to a wise
    man, and he will'
  '41': 'be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning. &l10&rThe
    fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is
    understanding. &l11&rFor by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of
    thy life shall be'
  '42': 'increased. &l12&rIf thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if
    thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. &l13&rA foolish woman is clamorous: she

    &l16&rWhoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding,

  '46': '&l15&rThe heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise

    tongue breaketh the'
  '28': bone. &l16&rHast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. &l17&rWithdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. &l18&rA man that beareth false witness
  '29': against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. &l19&rConfidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. &l20&rAs he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so
  '30': 'is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. &l21&rIf thine enemy be hungry,
    give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: &l22&rFor
    thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee. &l23&rThe
    north wind'
  '31': 'driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. &l24&rIt
    is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and
    in a wide house. &l25&rAs cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from
    a far country.'
  '32': '&l26&rA righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain,
    and a corrupt spring. &l27&rIt is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search
    their own glory is not glory. &l28&rHe that hath no rule over his own spirit is
    like a city'
  '33': that is broken down, and without walls.
  '34': 'Chapter 26

    As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.
    &l2&rAs the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless
    shall not come. &l3&rA whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for
    the'
  '35': fool's back. &l4&rAnswer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. &l5&rAnswer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. &l6&rHe that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and
  '36': 'drinketh damage. &l7&rThe legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable
    in the mouth of fools. &l8&rAs he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that
    giveth honour to a fool. &l9&rAs a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard,
    so is a parable in the'
  '37': mouths of fools. &l10&rThe great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. &l11&rAs a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. &l12&rSeest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of
  '38': a fool than of him. &l13&rThe slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. &l14&rAs the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. &l15&rThe slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring
  '39': it again to his mouth. &l16&rThe sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. &l17&rHe that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. &l18&rAs a mad man who
  '40': 'casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, &l19&rSo is the man that deceiveth
    his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? &l20&rWhere no wood is, there the
    fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. &l21&rAs
    coals are to burning'
  '41': coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. &l22&rThe words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. &l23&rBurning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.
  '42': '&l24&rHe that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within
    him; &l25&rWhen he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations
    in his heart. &l26&rWhose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
    shewed before the'
  '43': 'whole congregation. &l27&rWhoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he
    that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. &l28&rA lying tongue hateth those
    that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.'
  '44': 'Chapter 27

    Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
    &l2&rLet another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not
    thine own lips. &l3&rA stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool''s wrath
    is'
  '45': heavier than them both. &l4&rWrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy? &l5&rOpen rebuke is better than secret love. &l6&rFaithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. &l7&rThe full soul
  '46': 'loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
    &l8&rAs a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his
    place. &l9&rOintment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a
    man''s friend by'
  '47': 'hearty counsel. &l10&rThine own friend, and thy father''s friend, forsake
    not; neither go into thy brother''s house in the day of thy calamity: for better
    is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. &l11&rMy son, be wise, and
    make my heart glad, that'
  '48': I may answer him that reproacheth me. &l12&rA prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished. &l13&rTake his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. &l14&rHe that
  '49': blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. &l15&rA continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. &l16&rWhosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his
  '50': 'right hand, which bewrayeth itself. &l17&rIron sharpeneth iron; so a man
    sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. &l18&rWhoso keepeth the fig tree shall

    little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise: &l25&rThe ants are a people
    not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer; &l26&rThe conies are but
    a feeble folk, yet'

  '39': '&l30&rA lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;
    &l31&rA greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising
    up. &l32&rIf thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought
    evil, lay thine'
  '40': 'hand upon thy mouth. &l33&rSurely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter,

    forth strife.'
