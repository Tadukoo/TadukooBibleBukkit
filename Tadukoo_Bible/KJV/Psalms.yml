ch73v1: Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.
ch73v2: But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
ch73v3: For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
ch73v4: 'For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.'
ch73v5: They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
ch73v6: Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
ch73v7: 'Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.'
ch73v8: 'They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.'
ch73v9: They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
ch73v10: 'Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.'
ch73v11: And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
ch73v12: Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
ch73v13: Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
ch73v14: For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
ch73v15: If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
ch73v16: When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
ch73v17: Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.
ch73v18: 'Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.'
ch73v19: How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.
ch73v20: As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
ch73v21: Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
ch73v22: 'So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.'
ch73v23: 'Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.'
ch73v24: Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.
ch73v25: Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.
ch73v26: 'My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.'
ch73v27: 'For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.'
ch73v28: 'But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy works.'

ch78v1: 'Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.'
ch78v2: 'I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:'
ch78v3: Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
ch78v4: We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
ch78v5: 'For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:'
ch78v6: 'That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:'
ch78v7: 'That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:'
ch78v8: And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
ch78v9: The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
ch78v10: They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
ch78v11: And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
ch78v12: Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
ch78v13: He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
ch78v14: In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
ch78v15: He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
ch78v16: He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
ch78v17: And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
ch78v18: And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
ch78v19: Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
ch78v20: Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
ch78v21: 'Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;'
ch78v22: 'Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:'
ch78v23: Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
ch78v24: And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
ch78v25: 'Man did eat angels'' food: he sent them meat to the full.'
ch78v26: 'He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.'
ch78v27: 'He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:'
ch78v28: And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
ch78v29: 'So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;'
ch78v30: They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
ch78v31: The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
ch78v32: For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
ch78v33: Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
ch78v34: 'When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.'
ch78v35: And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
ch78v36: Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
ch78v37: For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
ch78v38: 'But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.'
ch78v39: For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
ch78v40: How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
ch78v41: Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
ch78v42: They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
ch78v43: How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
ch78v44: And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
ch78v45: He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
ch78v46: He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
ch78v47: He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
ch78v48: He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
ch78v49: He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
ch78v50: He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
ch78v51: 'And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:'
ch78v52: But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
ch78v53: 'And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.'
ch78v54: And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
ch78v55: He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
ch78v56: 'Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:'
ch78v57: 'But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.'
ch78v58: For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
ch78v59: 'When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:'
ch78v60: So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
ch78v61: 'And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy''s hand.'
ch78v62: He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
ch78v63: The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
ch78v64: Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
ch78v65: Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
ch78v66: 'And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.'
ch78v67: 'Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:'
ch78v68: But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
ch78v69: And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
ch78v70: 'He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:'
ch78v71: From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
ch78v72: So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

ch79v1: O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

ch79v12: And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
ch79v13: 'So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.'
