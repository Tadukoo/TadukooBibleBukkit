  '1': Chapter 1/nBlessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. &l2&rBut his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
  '2': '&l3&rAnd he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth
    forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever
    he doeth shall prosper. &l4&rThe ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which
    the wind driveth'
  '3': 'away. &l5&rTherefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners
    in the congregation of the righteous. &l6&rFor the Lord knoweth the way of the
    righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.'
  '4': Chapter 2/nWhy do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? &l2&rThe kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, &l3&rLet us break their bands asunder, and cast
  '5': 'away their cords from us. &l4&rHe that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:
    the Lord shall have them in derision. &l5&rThen shall he speak unto them in his
    wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. &l6&rYet have I set my king upon
    my holy hill of Zion.'
  '6': '&l7&rI will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son;
    this day have I begotten thee. &l8&rAsk of me, and I shall give thee the heathen
    for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
    &l9&rThou shalt'
  '7': 'break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter''s
    vessel. &l10&rBe wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the
    earth. &l11&rServe the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. &l12&rKiss
    the Son, lest he be'
  '8': angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
  '9': Chapter 3/nLord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me. &l2&rMany there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah. &l3&rBut thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine
  '10': head. &l4&rI cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. &l5&rI laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me. &l6&rI will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round
  '11': 'about. &l7&rArise, O Lord; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine
    enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. &l8&rSalvation
    belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.'
  '12': 'Chapter 4/nHear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged
    me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. &l2&rO ye sons
    of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity,
    and seek after'
  '13': 'leasing? Selah. &l3&rBut know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly
    for himself: the Lord will hear when I call unto him. &l4&rStand in awe, and sin
    not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. &l5&rOffer
    the sacrifices of'
  '14': righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord. &l6&rThere be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. &l7&rThou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine
  '15': 'increased. &l8&rI will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord,
    only makest me dwell in safety.'
  '16': 'Chapter 5/nGive ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation. &l2&rHearken
    unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray. &l3&rMy
    voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my
    prayer unto thee,'
  '17': 'and will look up. &l4&rFor thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
    neither shall evil dwell with thee. &l5&rThe foolish shall not stand in thy sight:
    thou hatest all workers of iniquity. &l6&rThou shalt destroy them that speak leasing:
    the'
  '18': 'Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. &l7&rBut as for me, I will
    come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship
    toward thy holy temple. &l8&rLead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of
    mine enemies; make thy'
  '19': way straight before my face. &l9&rFor there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. &l10&rDestroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;
  '20': 'cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled
    against thee. &l11&rBut let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let
    them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love
    thy name be joyful'
  '21': in thee. &l12&rFor thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
  '22': 'Chapter 6/nO Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy
    hot displeasure. &l2&rHave mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal
    me; for my bones are vexed. &l3&rMy soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord,
    how long? &l4&rReturn, O'
  '23': 'Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'' sake. &l5&rFor in death
    there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks? &l6&rI
    am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch
    with my tears.'
  '24': '&l7&rMine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all
    mine enemies. &l8&rDepart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath
    heard the voice of my weeping. &l9&rThe Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord
    will receive my'
  '25': 'prayer. &l10&rLet all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return
    and be ashamed suddenly.'
  '26': 'Chapter 7/nO Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them
    that persecute me, and deliver me: &l2&rLest he tear my soul like a lion, rending
    it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. &l3&rO Lord my God, If I have done
    this; if there be'
  '27': iniquity in my hands; &l4&rIf I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) &l5&rLet the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay
  '28': 'mine honour in the dust. Selah. &l6&rArise, O Lord, in thine anger, lift
    up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment
    that thou hast commanded. &l7&rSo shall the congregation of the people compass
    thee about: for their'
  '29': 'sakes therefore return thou on high. &l8&rThe Lord shall judge the people:
    judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity
    that is in me. &l9&rOh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish
    the just: for'
  '30': the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. &l10&rMy defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. &l11&rGod judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. &l12&rIf he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow,
  '31': and made it ready. &l13&rHe hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. &l14&rBehold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. &l15&rHe made a pit, and
  '32': 'digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. &l16&rHis mischief
    shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his
    own pate. &l17&rI will praise the Lord according to his righteousness: and will
    sing praise to the'
  '33': name of the Lord most high.
  '34': Chapter 8/nO Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. &l2&rOut of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the
  '35': avenger. &l3&rWhen I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; &l4&rWhat is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? &l5&rFor thou hast made him a little lower
  '36': 'than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. &l6&rThou madest
    him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under
    his feet: &l7&rAll sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; &l8&rThe
    fowl of the air,'
  '37': and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. &l9&rO Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
  '38': 'Chapter 9/nI will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth
    all thy marvellous works. &l2&rI will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing
    praise to thy name, O thou most High. &l3&rWhen mine enemies are turned back,
    they shall fall and'
  '39': perish at thy presence. &l4&rFor thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. &l5&rThou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. &l6&rO thou enemy,
  '40': 'destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities;
    their memorial is perished with them. &l7&rBut the Lord shall endure for ever:
    he hath prepared his throne for judgment. &l8&rAnd he shall judge the world in
    righteousness, he shall'
  '41': 'minister judgment to the people in uprightness. &l9&rThe Lord also will be
    a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. &l10&rAnd they that
    know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken
    them that seek thee.'
  '42': '&l11&rSing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the
    people his doings. &l12&rWhen he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth
    them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. &l13&rHave mercy upon me, O Lord;
    consider my trouble'
  '43': 'which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates
    of death: &l14&rThat I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter
    of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. &l15&rThe heathen are sunk down in the
    pit that they'
  '44': 'made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. &l16&rThe Lord is
    known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of
    his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. &l17&rThe wicked shall be turned into hell, and
    all the nations that'
  '45': 'forget God. &l18&rFor the needy shall not always be forgotten: the expectation
    of the poor shall not perish for ever. &l19&rArise, O Lord; let not man prevail:
    let the heathen be judged in thy sight. &l20&rPut them in fear, O Lord: that the
    nations may'
  '46': know themselves to be but men. Selah.
  '47': 'Chapter 10/nWhy standest thou afar off, O Lord? why hidest thou thyself in
    times of trouble? &l2&rThe wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them
    be taken in the devices that they have imagined. &l3&rFor the wicked boasteth
    of his heart''s desire,'
  '48': 'and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth. &l4&rThe wicked, through
    the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
    &l5&rHis ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight:
    as for all'
  '49': 'his enemies, he puffeth at them. &l6&rHe hath said in his heart, I shall
    not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity. &l7&rHis mouth is full of cursing
    and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity. &l8&rHe sitteth
    in the lurking places'
  '50': 'of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes
    are privily set against the poor. &l9&rHe lieth in wait secretly as a lion in
    his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth
    him into his net.'

    in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. &l14&rThou hast seen it; for thou beholdest
    mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto
    thee; thou art'

    evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none. &l16&rThe Lord is King

  '15': Chapter 14/nThe fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. &l2&rThe Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand,

    filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. &l4&rHave all the workers
    of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not

  '21': taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
  '22': 'Chapter 16/nPreserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. &l2&rO my
    soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not
    to thee; &l3&rBut to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in

  '28': hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. &l4&rConcerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. &l5&rHold up my goings in
  '29': 'thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. &l6&rI have called upon thee, for
    thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech. &l7&rShew
    thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which
    put their trust in'

    eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, &l9&rFrom the wicked that oppress
    me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about. &l10&rThey are inclosed in their
    own fat: with their'

    they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; &l12&rLike as a lion that is
    greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. &l13&rArise,
    O Lord,'
  '32': 'disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is
    thy sword: &l14&rFrom men which are thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world, which
    have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure:
    they are full'

    for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I
    awake, with thy likeness.'
  '34': Chapter 18/nI will love thee, O Lord, my strength. &l2&rThe Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. &l3&rI will call upon the Lord, who is
  '35': 'worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. &l4&rThe sorrows
    of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. &l5&rThe
    sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me. &l6&rIn
    my distress I called'
  '36': 'upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple,
    and my cry came before him, even into his ears. &l7&rThen the earth shook and
    trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he
    was wroth. &l8&rThere'
  '37': 'went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured:
    coals were kindled by it. &l9&rHe bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness
    was under his feet. &l10&rAnd he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did
    fly upon the wings'
  '38': of the wind. &l11&rHe made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. &l12&rAt the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire. &l13&rThe Lord also
  '39': thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire. &l14&rYea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. &l15&rThen the channels of waters were seen, and the
  '40': 'foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast
    of the breath of thy nostrils. &l16&rHe sent from above, he took me, he drew me
    out of many waters. &l17&rHe delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them
    which hated me: for'
  '41': 'they were too strong for me. &l18&rThey prevented me in the day of my calamity:
    but the Lord was my stay. &l19&rHe brought me forth also into a large place; he
    delivered me, because he delighted in me. &l20&rThe Lord rewarded me according
    to my'
  '42': righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. &l21&rFor I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. &l22&rFor all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
  '43': '&l23&rI was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
    &l24&rTherefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness, according
    to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. &l25&rWith the merciful thou wilt
    shew thyself'
  '44': merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; &l26&rWith the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. &l27&rFor thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks. &l28&rFor
  '45': 'thou wilt light my candle: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness. &l29&rFor
    by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. &l30&rAs
    for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to
    all those'
  '46': that trust in him. &l31&rFor who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock save our God? &l32&rIt is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. &l33&rHe maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places. &l34&rHe teacheth
  '47': 'my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. &l35&rThou
    hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden
    me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. &l36&rThou hast enlarged my steps
    under me, that my feet'
  '48': 'did not slip. &l37&rI have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither
    did I turn again till they were consumed. &l38&rI have wounded them that they
    were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet. &l39&rFor thou hast girded
    me with strength'
  '49': 'unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
    &l40&rThou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy
    them that hate me. &l41&rThey cried, but there was none to save them: even unto
    the Lord, but he'
  '50': 'answered them not. &l42&rThen did I beat them small as the dust before the
    wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.'

    shall submit'
  '2': themselves unto me. &l45&rThe strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. &l46&rThe Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. &l47&rIt is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
  '3': ' &l48&rHe delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those
    that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. &l49&rTherefore

    thy name.'
  '4': '&l50&rGreat deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed,
    to David, and to his seed for evermore.'
  '5': Chapter 19/nThe heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. &l2&rDay unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. &l3&rThere is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. &l4&rTheir line is
  '6': gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, &l5&rWhich is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. &l6&rHis going forth is from the
  '7': 'end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing

    soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. &l8&rThe statutes
    of the Lord are'
  '8': 'right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening
    the eyes. &l9&rThe fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments
    of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. &l10&rMore to be desired are they
    than gold, yea,'
  '9': 'than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. &l11&rMoreover
    by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward. &l12&rWho
    can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults. &l13&rKeep back
    thy servant'
  '10': 'also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall
    I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. &l14&rLet

  '13': 'according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel. &l5&rWe will rejoice

  '16': Chapter 21/nThe king shall joy in thy strength, O Lord; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! &l2&rThou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah. &l3&rFor thou preventest him with the blessings
  '17': 'of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head. &l4&rHe asked
    life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever. &l5&rHis
    glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him. &l6&rFor
    thou hast'
  '18': 'made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy
    countenance. &l7&rFor the king trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of
    the most High he shall not be moved. &l8&rThine hand shall find out all thine
    enemies: thy right hand'
  '19': 'shall find out those that hate thee. &l9&rThou shalt make them as a fiery
    oven in the time of thine anger: the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath,
    and the fire shall devour them. &l10&rTheir fruit shalt thou destroy from the
    earth, and their seed from'
  '20': 'among the children of men. &l11&rFor they intended evil against thee: they
    imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform. &l12&rTherefore
    shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows
    upon thy strings'
  '21': 'against the face of them. &l13&rBe thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength:
    so will we sing and praise thy power.'
  '22': Chapter 22/nMy God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? &l2&rO my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. &l3&rBut thou art holy, O
  '23': 'thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. &l4&rOur fathers trusted in thee:
    they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. &l5&rThey cried unto thee, and were

    on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted
    in him. &l9&rBut'
  '25': 'thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I

    lion. &l14&rI am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my
    heart is like wax;'
  '27': 'it is melted in the midst of my bowels. &l15&rMy strength is dried up like
    a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the
    dust of death. &l16&rFor dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have

    stare upon me. &l18&rThey part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
    &l19&rBut be not thou far from me, O Lord: O my strength, haste thee to help me.
    &l20&rDeliver'
  '29': 'my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. &l21&rSave
    me from the lion''s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
    &l22&rI will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation
    will I praise thee.'
  '30': '&l23&rYe that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify
    him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel. &l24&rFor he hath not despised nor
    abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him;
    but when he cried'
  '31': 'unto him, he heard. &l25&rMy praise shall be of thee in the great congregation:

    is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. &l9&rThe meek will he
    guide in judgment:'
  '45': and the meek will he teach his way. &l10&rAll the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. &l11&rFor thy name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great. &l12&rWhat man is he that feareth the

  '38': wherein thou hast dwelt. &l3&rLift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. &l4&rThine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs. &l5&rA man was
  '39': famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. &l6&rBut now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. &l7&rThey have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy

    they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. &l9&rWe see not our
    signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth
    how long.'
  '41': '&l10&rO God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme
    thy name for ever? &l11&rWhy withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck
    it out of thy bosom. &l12&rFor God is my King of old, working salvation in the
    midst of the'

    heads of the dragons in the waters. &l14&rThou brakest the heads of leviathan
    in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
    &l15&rThou didst cleave the'
  '43': 'fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. &l16&rThe day is thine,
    the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. &l17&rThou
    hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. &l18&rRemember
    this, that'
  '44': 'the enemy hath reproached, O Lord, and that the foolish people have blasphemed
    thy name. &l19&rO deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
    the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. &l20&rHave respect
    unto the'
  '45': 'covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of
    cruelty. &l21&rO let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
    praise thy name. &l22&rArise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish
    man reproacheth'
  '46': 'thee daily. &l23&rForget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those
    that rise up against thee increaseth continually.'
  '47': 'Chapter 75/nUnto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks:
    for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. &l2&rWhen I shall receive
    the congregation I will judge uprightly. &l3&rThe earth and all the inhabitants

    Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: &l5&rLift not up
    your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck. &l6&rFor promotion cometh neither
    from the east, nor'

    down one, and setteth up another. &l8&rFor in the hand of the Lord there is a
    cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same:
    but the dregs thereof,'
  '50': all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. &l9&rBut I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. &l10&rAll the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

  '19': the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. &l13&rHe divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. &l14&rIn the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. &l15&rHe clave the
  '20': rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. &l16&rHe brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. &l17&rAnd they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
  '21': '&l18&rAnd they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
    &l19&rYea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?

    the Lord heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger
    also came up against Israel; &l22&rBecause they believed not in God, and trusted
    not in his'
  '23': 'salvation: &l23&rThough he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened
    the doors of heaven, &l24&rAnd had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had
    given them of the corn of heaven. &l25&rMan did eat angels'' food: he sent them
    meat to the full.'
  '24': '&l26&rHe caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought
    in the south wind. &l27&rHe rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered
    fowls like as the sand of the sea: &l28&rAnd he let it fall in the midst of their
    camp, round'
  '25': 'about their habitations. &l29&rSo they did eat, and were well filled: for
    he gave them their own desire; &l30&rThey were not estranged from their lust.
    But while their meat was yet in their mouths, &l31&rThe wrath of God came upon
    them, and slew the'
  '26': fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. &l32&rFor all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. &l33&rTherefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. &l34&rWhen he slew them, then they
  '27': 'sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. &l35&rAnd they
    remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. &l36&rNevertheless
    they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
    &l37&rFor'
  '28': 'their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
    &l38&rBut he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed
    them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his
    wrath. &l39&rFor'
  '29': he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. &l40&rHow oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! &l41&rYea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
  '30': '&l42&rThey remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from
    the enemy. &l43&rHow he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
    field of Zoan. &l44&rAnd had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods,
    that they could not'
  '31': drink. &l45&rHe sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. &l46&rHe gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. &l47&rHe destroyed their vines with hail, and their
  '32': sycomore trees with frost. &l48&rHe gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. &l49&rHe cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. &l50&rHe made a
  '33': 'way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life
    over to the pestilence; &l51&rAnd smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief
    of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: &l52&rBut made his own people to
    go forth like sheep, and'
  '34': 'guided them in the wilderness like a flock. &l53&rAnd he led them on safely,
    so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. &l54&rAnd he brought
    them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand
    had'
  '35': 'purchased. &l55&rHe cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them
    an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
    &l56&rYet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
    &l57&rBut turned'
  '36': 'back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like
    a deceitful bow. &l58&rFor they provoked him to anger with their high places,
    and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. &l59&rWhen God heard this,
    he was wroth, and'
  '37': 'greatly abhorred Israel: &l60&rSo that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,
    the tent which he placed among men; &l61&rAnd delivered his strength into captivity,
    and his glory into the enemy''s hand. &l62&rHe gave his people over also unto
    the sword; and was'
  '38': wroth with his inheritance. &l63&rThe fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. &l64&rTheir priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. &l65&rThen the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a
  '39': 'mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. &l66&rAnd he smote his enemies
    in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. &l67&rMoreover he refused
    the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: &l68&rBut chose
    the tribe of Judah,'
  '40': 'the mount Zion which he loved. &l69&rAnd he built his sanctuary like high
    palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. &l70&rHe chose David
    also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: &l71&rFrom following the ewes
    great with young he'
  '41': brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. &l72&rSo he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
  '42': Chapter 79/nO god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. &l2&rThe dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto
  '43': the beasts of the earth. &l3&rTheir blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them. &l4&rWe are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. &l5&rHow long, Lord? wilt
  '44': thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? &l6&rPour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. &l7&rFor they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
  '45': '&l8&rO remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies
    speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. &l9&rHelp us, O God of our salvation,
    for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name''s
    sake.'
  '46': '&l10&rWherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known
    among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which
    is shed. &l11&rLet the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
    the greatness of'
  '47': thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die; &l12&rAnd render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. &l13&rSo we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for
  '48': 'ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.'
  '49': Chapter 80/nGive ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth. &l2&rBefore Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us. &l3&rTurn us again, O God,
  '50': and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. &l4&rO Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? &l5&rThou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.

    executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. &l31&rAnd that was counted unto
    him for righteousness'
  '41': 'unto all generations for evermore. &l32&rThey angered him also at the waters
    of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: &l33&rBecause they
    provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. &l34&rThey did
    not destroy the'

  '45': oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. &l43&rMany times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. &l44&rNevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard

    workers of'
  '17': iniquity. &l10&rLet the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
  '18': Chapter 142/nI cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication. &l2&rI poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. &l3&rWhen my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path.
  '19': 'In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. &l4&rI
    looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me:
    refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. &l5&rI cried unto thee, O Lord: I
    said, Thou art my refuge'
  '20': 'and my portion in the land of the living. &l6&rAttend unto my cry; for I
    am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than
    I. &l7&rBring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous
    shall compass me about;'
  '21': for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
  '22': 'Chapter 143/nHear my prayer, O Lord, give ear to my supplications: in thy
    faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness. &l2&rAnd enter not into judgment
    with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. &l3&rFor
    the enemy hath'
  '23': persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. &l4&rTherefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. &l5&rI remember the days of old; I
  '24': 'meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. &l6&rI stretch
    forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.
    &l7&rHear me speedily, O Lord: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest
    I be like unto'
  '25': 'them that go down into the pit. &l8&rCause me to hear thy lovingkindness
    in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should
    walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee. &l9&rDeliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies:
    I flee unto thee'
  '26': 'to hide me. &l10&rTeach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit
    is good; lead me into the land of uprightness. &l11&rQuicken me, O Lord, for thy
    name''s sake: for thy righteousness'' sake bring my soul out of trouble. &l12&rAnd

    me. &l3&rLord, what is'
  '29': 'man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest
    account of him! &l4&rMan is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth

    shall smoke.'
  '30': '&l6&rCast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and
    destroy them. &l7&rSend thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great
    waters, from the hand of strange children; &l8&rWhose mouth speaketh vanity, and
    their right hand is'
  '31': 'a right hand of falsehood. &l9&rI will sing a new song unto thee, O God:
    upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
    &l10&rIt is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant
    from the hurtful'
  '32': 'sword. &l11&rRid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose

    corner stones,'

    and ten thousands in our streets: &l14&rThat our oxen may be strong to labour;
    that there be no breaking'
  '34': 'in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets. &l15&rHappy
    is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is
    the Lord.'
  '35': Chapter 145/nI will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. &l2&rEvery day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. &l3&rGreat is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is
  '36': 'unsearchable. &l4&rOne generation shall praise thy works to another, and
    shall declare thy mighty acts. &l5&rI will speak of the glorious honour of thy
    majesty, and of thy wondrous works. &l6&rAnd men shall speak of the might of thy
    terrible acts: and I'
  '37': 'will declare thy greatness. &l7&rThey shall abundantly utter the memory of
    thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. &l8&rThe Lord is gracious,
    and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. &l9&rThe Lord is good
    to all: and his'
  '38': tender mercies are over all his works. &l10&rAll thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee. &l11&rThey shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; &l12&rTo make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and
  '39': the glorious majesty of his kingdom. &l13&rThy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. &l14&rThe Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down. &l15&rThe eyes of all wait upon
  '40': thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. &l16&rThou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. &l17&rThe Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. &l18&rThe Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon
  '41': 'him, to all that call upon him in truth. &l19&rHe will fulfil the desire

    live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any

    Lord loveth the righteous:'

    widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. &l10&rThe Lord shall
    reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.'
  '47': 'Chapter 147/nPraise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our
    God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. &l2&rThe Lord doth build up Jerusalem:
    he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. &l3&rHe healeth the broken in heart,
    and bindeth up'
  '48': 'their wounds. &l4&rHe telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all
    by their names. &l5&rGreat is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding
