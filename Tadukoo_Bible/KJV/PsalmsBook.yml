  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth
    in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. &l2&rBut his delight
    is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.'
  '2': '&l3&rAnd he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth
    forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever
    he doeth shall prosper. &l4&rThe ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which
    the wind driveth'
  '3': 'away. &l5&rTherefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners
    in the congregation of the righteous. &l6&rFor the Lord knoweth the way of the
    righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.'
  '4': 'Chapter 2

    Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? &l2&rThe kings of
    the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord,
    and against his anointed, saying, &l3&rLet us break their bands asunder, and cast'
  '5': 'away their cords from us. &l4&rHe that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:
    the Lord shall have them in derision. &l5&rThen shall he speak unto them in his
    wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. &l6&rYet have I set my king upon
    my holy hill of Zion.'
  '6': '&l7&rI will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son;
    this day have I begotten thee. &l8&rAsk of me, and I shall give thee the heathen
    for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
    &l9&rThou shalt'
  '7': 'break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter''s
    vessel. &l10&rBe wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the
    earth. &l11&rServe the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. &l12&rKiss
    the Son, lest he be'
  '8': angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
  '9': 'Chapter 3

    Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against
    me. &l2&rMany there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God.
    Selah. &l3&rBut thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up
    of mine'
  '10': head. &l4&rI cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. &l5&rI laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me. &l6&rI will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round
  '11': 'about. &l7&rArise, O Lord; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine
    enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. &l8&rSalvation
    belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.'
  '12': 'Chapter 4

    Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was
    in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. &l2&rO ye sons of men, how
    long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek
    after'
  '13': 'leasing? Selah. &l3&rBut know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly
    for himself: the Lord will hear when I call unto him. &l4&rStand in awe, and sin
    not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. &l5&rOffer
    the sacrifices of'
  '14': righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord. &l6&rThere be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. &l7&rThou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine
  '15': 'increased. &l8&rI will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord,
    only makest me dwell in safety.'
  '16': 'Chapter 5

    Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation. &l2&rHearken unto the voice
    of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray. &l3&rMy voice shalt
    thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto
    thee,'
  '17': 'and will look up. &l4&rFor thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
    neither shall evil dwell with thee. &l5&rThe foolish shall not stand in thy sight:
    thou hatest all workers of iniquity. &l6&rThou shalt destroy them that speak leasing:
    the'
  '18': 'Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. &l7&rBut as for me, I will
    come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship
    toward thy holy temple. &l8&rLead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of
    mine enemies; make thy'
  '19': way straight before my face. &l9&rFor there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. &l10&rDestroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;
  '20': 'cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled
    against thee. &l11&rBut let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let
    them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love
    thy name be joyful'
  '21': in thee. &l12&rFor thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
  '22': 'Chapter 6

    O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
    &l2&rHave mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my bones
    are vexed. &l3&rMy soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? &l4&rReturn,
    O'
  '23': 'Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'' sake. &l5&rFor in death
    there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks? &l6&rI
    am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch
    with my tears.'
  '24': '&l7&rMine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all
    mine enemies. &l8&rDepart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath
    heard the voice of my weeping. &l9&rThe Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord
    will receive my'
  '25': 'prayer. &l10&rLet all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return
    and be ashamed suddenly.'
  '26': 'Chapter 7

    O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute
    me, and deliver me: &l2&rLest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces,
    while there is none to deliver. &l3&rO Lord my God, If I have done this; if there
    be'
  '27': iniquity in my hands; &l4&rIf I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) &l5&rLet the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay
  '28': 'mine honour in the dust. Selah. &l6&rArise, O Lord, in thine anger, lift
    up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment
    that thou hast commanded. &l7&rSo shall the congregation of the people compass
    thee about: for their'
  '29': 'sakes therefore return thou on high. &l8&rThe Lord shall judge the people:
    judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity
    that is in me. &l9&rOh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish
    the just: for'
  '30': the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. &l10&rMy defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. &l11&rGod judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. &l12&rIf he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow,
  '31': and made it ready. &l13&rHe hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. &l14&rBehold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. &l15&rHe made a pit, and
  '32': 'digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. &l16&rHis mischief
    shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his
    own pate. &l17&rI will praise the Lord according to his righteousness: and will
    sing praise to the'
  '33': name of the Lord most high.
  '34': 'Chapter 8

    O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy
    glory above the heavens. &l2&rOut of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou
    ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy
    and the'
  '35': avenger. &l3&rWhen I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; &l4&rWhat is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? &l5&rFor thou hast made him a little lower
  '36': 'than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. &l6&rThou madest
    him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under
    his feet: &l7&rAll sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; &l8&rThe
    fowl of the air,'
  '37': and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. &l9&rO Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
  '38': 'Chapter 9

    I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous
    works. &l2&rI will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name,
    O thou most High. &l3&rWhen mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and'
  '39': perish at thy presence. &l4&rFor thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. &l5&rThou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. &l6&rO thou enemy,
  '40': 'destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities;
    their memorial is perished with them. &l7&rBut the Lord shall endure for ever:
    he hath prepared his throne for judgment. &l8&rAnd he shall judge the world in
    righteousness, he shall'
  '41': 'minister judgment to the people in uprightness. &l9&rThe Lord also will be
    a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. &l10&rAnd they that
    know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken
    them that seek thee.'
  '42': '&l11&rSing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the
    people his doings. &l12&rWhen he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth
    them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. &l13&rHave mercy upon me, O Lord;
    consider my trouble'
  '43': 'which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates
    of death: &l14&rThat I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter
    of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. &l15&rThe heathen are sunk down in the
    pit that they'
  '44': 'made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. &l16&rThe Lord is
    known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of
    his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. &l17&rThe wicked shall be turned into hell, and
    all the nations that'
  '45': 'forget God. &l18&rFor the needy shall not always be forgotten: the expectation
    of the poor shall not perish for ever. &l19&rArise, O Lord; let not man prevail:
    let the heathen be judged in thy sight. &l20&rPut them in fear, O Lord: that the
    nations may'
  '46': know themselves to be but men. Selah.
  '47': 'Chapter 10

    Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
    &l2&rThe wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the
    devices that they have imagined. &l3&rFor the wicked boasteth of his heart''s
    desire,'
  '48': 'and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth. &l4&rThe wicked, through
    the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
    &l5&rHis ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight:
    as for all'
  '49': 'his enemies, he puffeth at them. &l6&rHe hath said in his heart, I shall
    not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity. &l7&rHis mouth is full of cursing
    and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity. &l8&rHe sitteth
    in the lurking places'
  '50': 'of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes
    are privily set against the poor. &l9&rHe lieth in wait secretly as a lion in
    his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth
    him into his net.'

    horn of my salvation, and my high tower. &l3&rI will call upon the Lord, who is'
  '35': 'worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. &l4&rThe sorrows
    of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. &l5&rThe
    sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me. &l6&rIn
    my distress I called'
  '36': 'upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple,
    and my cry came before him, even into his ears. &l7&rThen the earth shook and
    trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he
    was wroth. &l8&rThere'
  '37': 'went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured:
    coals were kindled by it. &l9&rHe bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness
    was under his feet. &l10&rAnd he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did
    fly upon the wings'
  '38': of the wind. &l11&rHe made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. &l12&rAt the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire. &l13&rThe Lord also
  '39': thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire. &l14&rYea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. &l15&rThen the channels of waters were seen, and the
  '40': 'foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast
    of the breath of thy nostrils. &l16&rHe sent from above, he took me, he drew me
    out of many waters. &l17&rHe delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them
    which hated me: for'
  '41': 'they were too strong for me. &l18&rThey prevented me in the day of my calamity:
    but the Lord was my stay. &l19&rHe brought me forth also into a large place; he
    delivered me, because he delighted in me. &l20&rThe Lord rewarded me according
    to my'
  '42': righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. &l21&rFor I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. &l22&rFor all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
  '43': '&l23&rI was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
    &l24&rTherefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness, according
    to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. &l25&rWith the merciful thou wilt
    shew thyself'
  '44': merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; &l26&rWith the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. &l27&rFor thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks. &l28&rFor
  '45': 'thou wilt light my candle: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness. &l29&rFor
    by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. &l30&rAs
    for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to
    all those'
  '46': that trust in him. &l31&rFor who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock save our God? &l32&rIt is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. &l33&rHe maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places. &l34&rHe teacheth
  '47': 'my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. &l35&rThou
    hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden
    me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. &l36&rThou hast enlarged my steps
    under me, that my feet'
  '48': 'did not slip. &l37&rI have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither
    did I turn again till they were consumed. &l38&rI have wounded them that they
    were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet. &l39&rFor thou hast girded
    me with strength'
  '49': 'unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
    &l40&rThou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy

    eyes stand out'
  '29': 'with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. &l8&rThey are corrupt,
    and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily. &l9&rThey set their

    these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches. &l13&rVerily
    I have'
  '31': cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. &l14&rFor all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. &l15&rIf I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children. &l16&rWhen I
  '32': 'thought to know this, it was too painful for me; &l17&rUntil I went into

    them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. &l19&rHow are
    they brought into'
  '33': desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. &l20&rAs a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. &l21&rThus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. &l22&rSo foolish was I,
  '34': 'and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee. &l23&rNevertheless I am continually
    with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. &l24&rThou shalt guide me with
    thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. &l25&rWhom have I in heaven but

    O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against

    of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion,'

    how long.'

    hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. &l18&rRemember
    this, that'

    thy name. &l19&rO deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
    the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. &l20&rHave respect
    unto the'

    cruelty. &l21&rO let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy

    that rise up against thee increaseth continually.'

    Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
    &l2&rI will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: &l3&rWhich
    we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. &l4&rWe will not hide them'
  '15': from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. &l5&rFor he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that
  '16': 'they should make them known to their children: &l6&rThat the generation to
    come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise
    and declare them to their children: &l7&rThat they might set their hope in God,
    and not forget the'
  '17': 'works of God, but keep his commandments: &l8&rAnd might not be as their fathers,
    a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright,
    and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. &l9&rThe children of Ephraim, being
    armed, and'
  '18': carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. &l10&rThey kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; &l11&rAnd forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. &l12&rMarvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in
  '19': the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. &l13&rHe divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. &l14&rIn the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. &l15&rHe clave the
  '20': rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. &l16&rHe brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. &l17&rAnd they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
  '21': '&l18&rAnd they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
    &l19&rYea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
    &l20&rBehold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed;
    can'
  '22': 'he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? &l21&rTherefore
    the Lord heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger
    also came up against Israel; &l22&rBecause they believed not in God, and trusted
    not in his'
  '23': 'salvation: &l23&rThough he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened
    the doors of heaven, &l24&rAnd had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had
    given them of the corn of heaven. &l25&rMan did eat angels'' food: he sent them
    meat to the full.'
  '24': '&l26&rHe caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought
    in the south wind. &l27&rHe rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered
    fowls like as the sand of the sea: &l28&rAnd he let it fall in the midst of their
    camp, round'
  '25': 'about their habitations. &l29&rSo they did eat, and were well filled: for
    he gave them their own desire; &l30&rThey were not estranged from their lust.
    But while their meat was yet in their mouths, &l31&rThe wrath of God came upon
    them, and slew the'
  '26': fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. &l32&rFor all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. &l33&rTherefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. &l34&rWhen he slew them, then they
  '27': 'sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. &l35&rAnd they
    remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. &l36&rNevertheless
    they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
    &l37&rFor'
  '28': 'their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
    &l38&rBut he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed
    them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his
    wrath. &l39&rFor'
  '29': he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. &l40&rHow oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! &l41&rYea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
  '30': '&l42&rThey remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from
    the enemy. &l43&rHow he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
    field of Zoan. &l44&rAnd had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods,
    that they could not'
  '31': drink. &l45&rHe sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. &l46&rHe gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. &l47&rHe destroyed their vines with hail, and their
  '32': sycomore trees with frost. &l48&rHe gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. &l49&rHe cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. &l50&rHe made a
  '33': 'way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life
    over to the pestilence; &l51&rAnd smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief
    of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: &l52&rBut made his own people to
    go forth like sheep, and'
  '34': 'guided them in the wilderness like a flock. &l53&rAnd he led them on safely,
    so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. &l54&rAnd he brought
    them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand
    had'
  '35': 'purchased. &l55&rHe cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them
    an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
    &l56&rYet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
    &l57&rBut turned'
  '36': 'back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like
    a deceitful bow. &l58&rFor they provoked him to anger with their high places,
    and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. &l59&rWhen God heard this,
    he was wroth, and'
  '37': 'greatly abhorred Israel: &l60&rSo that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,
    the tent which he placed among men; &l61&rAnd delivered his strength into captivity,
    and his glory into the enemy''s hand. &l62&rHe gave his people over also unto
    the sword; and was'
  '38': wroth with his inheritance. &l63&rThe fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. &l64&rTheir priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. &l65&rThen the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a
  '39': 'mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. &l66&rAnd he smote his enemies
    in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. &l67&rMoreover he refused
    the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: &l68&rBut chose
    the tribe of Judah,'
  '40': 'the mount Zion which he loved. &l69&rAnd he built his sanctuary like high
    palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. &l70&rHe chose David
    also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: &l71&rFrom following the ewes
    great with young he'
  '41': brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. &l72&rSo he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
  '42': 'Chapter 79

    O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they
    defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. &l2&rThe dead bodies of thy servants
    have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints

  '38': 'them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away
    his wrath, lest he should destroy them. &l24&rYea, they despised the pleasant

    executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. &l31&rAnd that was counted unto
    him for righteousness'
  '41': 'unto all generations for evermore. &l32&rThey angered him also at the waters
    of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: &l33&rBecause they
    provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. &l34&rThey did
    not destroy the'

  '45': oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. &l43&rMany times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. &l44&rNevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard
