ch2v1: Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
ch2v2: 'I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:'
ch2v3: And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
ch2v4: Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
ch2v5: Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.
ch2v6: But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.
ch2v7: He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
ch2v8: And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;
ch2v9: I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
ch2v10: 'Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.'

ch2v14: But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.
ch2v15: So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.
ch2v16: Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
ch2v17: He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.
ch2v18: And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;
ch2v19: I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.
ch2v20: Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.
ch2v21: And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.
ch2v22: Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.
ch2v23: 'And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.'
ch2v24: But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.
ch2v25: But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.
ch2v26: 'And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:'
ch2v27: 'And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.'
ch2v28: And I will give him the morning star.
ch2v29: He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
