  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants
    things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel
    unto his servant John: &l2&rWho bare record of the word of God, and of the'
  '2': 'testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. &l3&rBlessed is
    he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those
    things which are written therein: for the time is at hand. &l4&rJohn to the seven
    churches which are in'
  '3': 'Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and
    which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; &l5&rAnd
    from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the
    dead, and the prince'
  '4': of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, &l6&rAnd hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. &l7&rBehold, he cometh with clouds; and
  '5': 'every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds
    of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. &l8&rI am Alpha and Omega,
    the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which
    is to come, the'
  '6': Almighty. &l9&rI John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. &l10&rI was in the Spirit on
  '7': 'the Lord''s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, &l11&rSaying,
    I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a
    book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and
    unto Smyrna, and'
  '8': unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. &l12&rAnd I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; &l13&rAnd in the midst of the seven candlesticks one
  '9': like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. &l14&rHis head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; &l15&rAnd his feet like unto fine
  '10': 'brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many
    waters. &l16&rAnd he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went
    a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
    &l17&rAnd when I'
  '11': 'saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me,
    saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: &l18&rI am he that liveth,
    and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of
    hell and of death.'
  '12': '&l19&rWrite the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and
    the things which shall be hereafter; &l20&rThe mystery of the seven stars which
    thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars
    are the angels of'
  '13': 'the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the
    seven churches.'
  '14': 'Chapter 2

    Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth
    the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden
    candlesticks; &l2&rI know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how
    thou'
  '15': 'canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they
    are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: &l3&rAnd hast borne, and
    hast patience, and for my name''s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted. &l4&rNevertheless
    I have'
  '16': somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. &l5&rRemember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou
  '17': repent. &l6&rBut this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate. &l7&rHe that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in
  '18': the midst of the paradise of God. &l8&rAnd unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; &l9&rI know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the
  '19': 'blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue
    of Satan. &l10&rFear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the
    devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have
    tribulation ten'
  '20': 'days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
    &l11&rHe that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches;
    He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death. &l12&rAnd to the angel
    of the church in'
  '21': 'Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two
    edges; &l13&rI know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan''s seat
    is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those
    days wherein Antipas'
  '22': was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. &l14&rBut I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to
  '23': eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. &l15&rSo hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate. &l16&rRepent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my
  '24': mouth. &l17&rHe that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that
  '25': receiveth it. &l18&rAnd unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass; &l19&rI know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy
  '26': patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first. &l20&rNotwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit
  '27': fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. &l21&rAnd I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. &l22&rBehold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent
  '28': 'of their deeds. &l23&rAnd I will kill her children with death; and all the
    churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will
    give unto every one of you according to your works. &l24&rBut unto you I say,
    and unto the rest in'
  '29': Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. &l25&rBut that which ye have already hold fast till I come. &l26&rAnd he that overcometh, and keepeth my works
  '30': 'unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: &l27&rAnd he shall
    rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken
    to shivers: even as I received of my Father. &l28&rAnd I will give him the morning
    star. &l29&rHe that'
  '31': hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
  '32': 'Chapter 3

    And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath
    the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast
    a name that thou livest, and art dead. &l2&rBe watchful, and strengthen the things'
  '33': 'which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect
    before God. &l3&rRemember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
    fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a
    thief, and thou shalt'
  '34': 'not know what hour I will come upon thee. &l4&rThou hast a few names even
    in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in
    white: for they are worthy. &l5&rHe that overcometh, the same shall be clothed
    in white raiment; and I'
  '35': will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. &l6&rHe that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. &l7&rAnd to the angel of the church in Philadelphia
  '36': 'write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath
    the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man
    openeth; &l8&rI know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and
    no man can shut it:'
  '37': for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. &l9&rBehold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet,
  '38': 'and to know that I have loved thee. &l10&rBecause thou hast kept the word
    of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall
    come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. &l11&rBehold,
    I come quickly: hold that'
  '39': 'fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. &l12&rHim that overcometh
    will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and
    I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God,
    which is new Jerusalem,'
  '40': 'which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my
    new name. &l13&rHe that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
    churches. &l14&rAnd unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These
    things saith the'
  '41': 'Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;
    &l15&rI know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert
    cold or hot. &l16&rSo then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,
    I will spue thee out of'
  '42': 'my mouth. &l17&rBecause thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,
    and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable,
    and poor, and blind, and naked: &l18&rI counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
    the fire, that thou'
  '43': 'mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that
    the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve,
    that thou mayest see. &l19&rAs many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous
    therefore, and repent.'
  '44': '&l20&rBehold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and
    open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. &l21&rTo
    him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame,
    and am'
  '45': set down with my Father in his throne. &l22&rHe that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
  '46': 'Chapter 4

    After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice
    which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up
    hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter. &l2&rAnd immediately
    I'
  '47': 'was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on
    the throne. &l3&rAnd he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
    stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
    &l4&rAnd round'
  '48': 'about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four
    and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads
    crowns of gold. &l5&rAnd out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings
    and voices: and'
  '49': 'there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven
    Spirits of God. &l6&rAnd before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto
    crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four
    beasts full of eyes'
  '50': before and behind. &l7&rAnd the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.

  '1': 'Chapter 4 Cont.

    &l8&rAnd the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full
    of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord
    God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. &l9&rAnd when those beasts'
  '2': give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, &l10&rThe four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the
  '3': 'throne, saying, &l11&rThou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour
    and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and
    were created.'
  '4': 'Chapter 5

    And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within
    and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. &l2&rAnd I saw a strong angel proclaiming
    with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals'
  '5': thereof? &l3&rAnd no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. &l4&rAnd I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. &l5&rAnd one of the
  '6': 'elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the
    Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.
    &l6&rAnd I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts,
    and in the'
  '7': midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. &l7&rAnd he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. &l8&rAnd
  '8': when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. &l9&rAnd they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to
  '9': 'take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast
    redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people,
    and nation; &l10&rAnd hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
    reign on the earth.'
  '10': '&l11&rAnd I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the
    throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand
    times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; &l12&rSaying with a loud voice,
    Worthy is the Lamb that'
  '11': was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. &l13&rAnd every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying,
  '12': Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. &l14&rAnd the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.
  '13': 'Chapter 6

    And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise
    of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. &l2&rAnd I saw, and behold
    a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto'
  '14': 'him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. &l3&rAnd when he had opened
    the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. &l4&rAnd there went
    out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to
    take peace from'
  '15': 'the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto
    him a great sword. &l5&rAnd when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third
    beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on
    him had a pair of'
  '16': balances in his hand. &l6&rAnd I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. &l7&rAnd when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard
  '17': 'the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. &l8&rAnd I looked, and behold
    a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.
    And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with
    sword, and with'
  '18': 'hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. &l9&rAnd when he
    had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain
    for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: &l10&rAnd they cried
    with a loud'
  '19': voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? &l11&rAnd white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season,
  '20': until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. &l12&rAnd I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the
  '21': moon became as blood; &l13&rAnd the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. &l14&rAnd the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island
  '22': were moved out of their places. &l15&rAnd the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
  '23': '&l16&rAnd said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the
    face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: &l17&rFor
    the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?'
  '24': 'Chapter 7

    And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth,
    holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth,
    nor on the sea, nor on any tree. &l2&rAnd I saw another angel ascending from the'
  '25': 'east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to
    the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, &l3&rSaying,
    Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants
    of our God in'
  '26': 'their foreheads. &l4&rAnd I heard the number of them which were sealed: and
    there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of
    the children of Israel. &l5&rOf the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand.
    Of the tribe of Reuben'
  '27': were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand. &l6&rOf the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand. &l7&rOf the
  '28': tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand. &l8&rOf the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve
  '29': thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand. &l9&rAfter this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
  '30': with white robes, and palms in their hands; &l10&rAnd cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. &l11&rAnd all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts,
  '31': 'and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, &l12&rSaying,
    Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power,
    and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. &l13&rAnd one of the elders
    answered, saying'
  '32': unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? &l14&rAnd I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the
  '33': 'blood of the Lamb. &l15&rTherefore are they before the throne of God, and
    serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall
    dwell among them. &l16&rThey shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither
    shall the sun light'
  '34': 'on them, nor any heat. &l17&rFor the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne
    shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God
    shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.'
  '35': 'Chapter 8

    And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the
    space of half an hour. &l2&rAnd I saw the seven angels which stood before God;
    and to them were given seven trumpets. &l3&rAnd another angel came and stood at
    the'
  '36': altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. &l4&rAnd the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the
  '37': 'saints, ascended up before God out of the angel''s hand. &l5&rAnd the angel
    took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth:
    and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. &l6&rAnd
    the seven'
  '38': 'angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. &l7&rThe
    first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and
    they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all
    green grass was burnt'
  '39': 'up. &l8&rAnd the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning
    with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; &l9&rAnd
    the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and
    the third'
  '40': part of the ships were destroyed. &l10&rAnd the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; &l11&rAnd the name of the star is
  '41': 'called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many
    men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. &l12&rAnd the fourth angel
    sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the
    moon, and the third'
  '42': part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. &l13&rAnd I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the
  '43': inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!
  '44': 'Chapter 9

    And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth:
    and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. &l2&rAnd he opened the bottomless
    pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace;
    and'
  '45': 'the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. &l3&rAnd
    there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power,
    as the scorpions of the earth have power. &l4&rAnd it was commanded them that
    they should not'
  '46': 'hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but
    only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. &l5&rAnd to
    them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented
    five months: and'
  '47': their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. &l6&rAnd in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. &l7&rAnd the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses
  '48': prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. &l8&rAnd they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. &l9&rAnd they had breastplates, as it were
  '49': 'breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots
    of many horses running to battle. &l10&rAnd they had tails like unto scorpions,
    and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.
    &l11&rAnd'
  '50': they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon. &l12&rOne woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.

  '2': '&l15&rAnd the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and
    a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. &l16&rAnd the
    number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard
    the number of'
  '3': 'them. &l17&rAnd thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on
    them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads
    of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire
    and smoke and brimstone.'
  '4': ' &l18&rBy these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by
    the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. &l19&rFor their
    power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents,
    and had'
  '5': 'heads, and with them they do hurt. &l20&rAnd the rest of the men which were
    not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that
    they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and
    stone, and of wood:'
  '6': 'which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: &l21&rNeither repented they of
    their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their
    thefts.'
  '7': 'Chapter 10

    And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and
    a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet
    as pillars of fire: &l2&rAnd he had in his hand a little book open: and he set
    his'
  '8': 'right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, &l3&rAnd cried with
    a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered
    their voices. &l4&rAnd when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was
    about to write:'
  '9': and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. &l5&rAnd the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, &l6&rAnd sware by him that liveth
  '10': 'for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and
    the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which
    are therein, that there should be time no longer: &l7&rBut in the days of the
    voice of the seventh'
  '11': angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. &l8&rAnd the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand
  '12': of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. &l9&rAnd I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
  '13': 'honey. &l10&rAnd I took the little book out of the angel''s hand, and ate
    it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my
    belly was bitter. &l11&rAnd he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many
    peoples, and nations,'
  '14': and tongues, and kings.
  '15': 'Chapter 11

    And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise,
    and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. &l2&rBut
    the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it'
  '16': 'is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot
    forty and two months. &l3&rAnd I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they
    shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.
    &l4&rThese are the'
  '17': 'two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the
    earth. &l5&rAnd if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth,
    and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner
    be killed. &l6&rThese'
  '18': 'have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy:
    and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with
    all plagues, as often as they will. &l7&rAnd when they shall have finished their
    testimony, the beast'
  '19': that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. &l8&rAnd their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was
  '20': crucified. &l9&rAnd they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. &l10&rAnd they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them,
  '21': and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. &l11&rAnd after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear
  '22': fell upon them which saw them. &l12&rAnd they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. &l13&rAnd the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth
  '23': 'part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand:
    and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. &l14&rThe
    second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly. &l15&rAnd the seventh
    angel'
  '24': sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. &l16&rAnd the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell
  '25': upon their faces, and worshipped God, &l17&rSaying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. &l18&rAnd the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come,
  '26': and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. &l19&rAnd the
  '27': 'temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the
    ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings,
    and an earthquake, and great hail.'
  '28': 'Chapter 12

    And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and
    the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: &l2&rAnd she
    being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. &l3&rAnd'
  '29': 'there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having
    seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. &l4&rAnd his tail
    drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and
    the dragon stood'
  '30': 'before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child
    as soon as it was born. &l5&rAnd she brought forth a man child, who was to rule
    all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his
    throne. &l6&rAnd the'
  '31': 'woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that
    they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. &l7&rAnd
    there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and
    the dragon fought'
  '32': 'and his angels, &l8&rAnd prevailed not; neither was their place found any
    more in heaven. &l9&rAnd the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called
    the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the
    earth, and his angels'
  '33': 'were cast out with him. &l10&rAnd I heard a loud voice saying in heaven,
    Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power
    of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them
    before our God day and'
  '34': night. &l11&rAnd they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. &l12&rTherefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the
  '35': sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. &l13&rAnd when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. &l14&rAnd to the woman
  '36': were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. &l15&rAnd the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after
  '37': the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. &l16&rAnd the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. &l17&rAnd the dragon was wroth with the woman, and
  '38': went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
  '39': 'Chapter 13

    And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea,
    having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his
    heads the name of blasphemy. &l2&rAnd the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard,
    and'

    the beast? who is able to make war with him? &l5&rAnd there was given unto him
    a mouth speaking great'
  '42': things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. &l6&rAnd he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. &l7&rAnd it was given unto him to make
  '43': 'war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all

    I beheld'
  '45': another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. &l12&rAnd he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose
  '46': deadly wound was healed. &l13&rAnd he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, &l14&rAnd deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight
  '47': of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. &l15&rAnd he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak,
  '48': 'and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should
    be killed. &l16&rAnd he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
    and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: &l17&rAnd

    I wondered with'

  '39': 'shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that
    dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life

    a short space.'

    the seven, and goeth into perdition. &l12&rAnd the ten horns which thou sawest
    are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings
    one hour with the'
  '42': 'beast. &l13&rThese have one mind, and shall give their power and strength
    unto the beast. &l14&rThese shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
    them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are
    called, and'
  '43': chosen, and faithful. &l15&rAnd he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. &l16&rAnd the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall
  '44': make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. &l17&rFor God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. &l18&rAnd the woman

  '6': all. &l15&rThe merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, &l16&rAnd saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked
  '7': with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! &l17&rFor in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, &l18&rAnd cried when they saw the smoke of
  '8': her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city! &l19&rAnd they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for
  '9': in one hour is she made desolate. &l20&rRejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her. &l21&rAnd a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence
  '10': shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. &l22&rAnd the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be
  '11': 'found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more
    at all in thee; &l23&rAnd the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in
    thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more
    at all in thee: for thy'
  '12': merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. &l24&rAnd in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.
  '13': 'Chapter 19

    And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying,
    Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:
    &l2&rFor true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore,
    which'
  '14': did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. &l3&rAnd again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever. &l4&rAnd the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped
  '15': God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia. &l5&rAnd a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. &l6&rAnd I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the
  '16': 'voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia:
    for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. &l7&rLet us be glad and rejoice, and give
    honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself
    ready.'
  '17': '&l8&rAnd to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean
    and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. &l9&rAnd he saith
    unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of
    the Lamb. And he saith'
  '18': 'unto me, These are the true sayings of God. &l10&rAnd I fell at his feet
    to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant,
    and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony
    of Jesus is the'
  '19': spirit of prophecy. &l11&rAnd I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. &l12&rHis eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns;
  '20': 'and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. &l13&rAnd he
    was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of
    God. &l14&rAnd the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses,
    clothed in fine linen,'
  '21': 'white and clean. &l15&rAnd out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with
    it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and
    he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. &l16&rAnd
    he hath on his'
  '22': vesture and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords. &l17&rAnd I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the
  '23': supper of the great God; &l18&rThat ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great. &l19&rAnd
  '24': I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. &l20&rAnd the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which
  '25': he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. &l21&rAnd the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword
  '26': 'proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.'
  '27': 'Chapter 20

    And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit
    and a great chain in his hand. &l2&rAnd he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent,
    which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, &l3&rAnd cast him'
  '28': 'into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he
    should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled:
    and after that he must be loosed a little season. &l4&rAnd I saw thrones, and
    they sat upon them,'
  '29': 'and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded
    for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped
    the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads,
    or in their'
  '30': 'hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. &l5&rBut
    the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This
    is the first resurrection. &l6&rBlessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
    resurrection: on'
  '31': such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. &l7&rAnd when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, &l8&rAnd shall go out to deceive the
  '32': 'nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather
    them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. &l9&rAnd
    they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints
    about, and the'
  '33': 'beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
    &l10&rAnd the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,
    where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night
    for ever and'
  '34': 'ever. &l11&rAnd I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
    whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for
    them. &l12&rAnd I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books
    were opened: and'
  '35': 'another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged
    out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
    &l13&rAnd the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered
    up the dead which'
  '36': 'were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. &l14&rAnd
    death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. &l15&rAnd
    whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of
    fire.'
  '37': 'Chapter 21

    And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth
    were passed away; and there was no more sea. &l2&rAnd I John saw the holy city,
    new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned
    for'
  '38': her husband. &l3&rAnd I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. &l4&rAnd God shall wipe away all
  '39': 'tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,
    nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed
    away. &l5&rAnd he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.
    And he said unto me,'
  '40': 'Write: for these words are true and faithful. &l6&rAnd he said unto me, It
    is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him
    that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. &l7&rHe that overcometh
    shall inherit all'
  '41': things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. &l8&rBut the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
  '42': 'brimstone: which is the second death. &l9&rAnd there came unto me one of
    the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and
    talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb''s wife.
    &l10&rAnd he carried'
  '43': 'me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great
    city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, &l11&rHaving the
    glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper
    stone, clear as'
  '44': 'crystal; &l12&rAnd had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at
    the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the
    twelve tribes of the children of Israel: &l13&rOn the east three gates; on the
    north three gates; on'
  '45': the south three gates; and on the west three gates. &l14&rAnd the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. &l15&rAnd he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates
  '46': 'thereof, and the wall thereof. &l16&rAnd the city lieth foursquare, and the
    length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve
    thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
    &l17&rAnd he'
  '47': 'measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according
    to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. &l18&rAnd the building of the
    wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. &l19&rAnd
    the foundations'
  '48': of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; &l20&rThe fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the
  '49': 'eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh,
    a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. &l21&rAnd the twelve gates were twelve pearls:
    every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold,
    as it were'
  '50': 'transparent glass. &l22&rAnd I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty
    and the Lamb are the temple of it.'

    the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the'

    of the throne of God and of the Lamb. &l2&rIn the midst of the street of it, and
