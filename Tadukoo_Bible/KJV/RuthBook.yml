  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine
    in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country
    of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. &l2&rAnd the name of the man was'
  '2': Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there. &l3&rAnd Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two
  '3': 'sons. &l4&rAnd they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the
    one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten
    years. &l5&rAnd Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left
    of her two sons and'
  '4': 'her husband. &l6&rThen she arose with her daughters in law, that she might
    return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how
    that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread. &l7&rWherefore she
    went forth out of the'
  '5': 'place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went
    on the way to return unto the land of Judah. &l8&rAnd Naomi said unto her two
    daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother''s house: the Lord deal kindly
    with you, as ye have dealt'
  '6': with the dead, and with me. &l9&rThe Lord grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. &l10&rAnd they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy
  '7': 'people. &l11&rAnd Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
    me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? &l12&rTurn
    again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should
    say, I'
  '8': have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons; &l13&rWould ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the
  '9': 'Lord is gone out against me. &l14&rAnd they lifted up their voice, and wept
    again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her. &l15&rAnd
    she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her
    gods: return thou after'
  '10': 'thy sister in law. &l16&rAnd Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or
    to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where
    thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:
    &l17&rWhere thou'
  '11': 'diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and
    more also, if ought but death part thee and me. &l18&rWhen she saw that she was
    stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her. &l19&rSo they
    two went until they'
  '12': 'came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem,
    that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi? &l20&rAnd
    she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt
    very bitterly with'
  '13': 'me. &l21&rI went out full and the Lord hath brought me home again empty:
    why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath testified against me, and the
    Almighty hath afflicted me? &l22&rSo Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her
    daughter in law, with'
  '14': 'her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem
    in the beginning of barley harvest.'
  '15': 'Chapter 2

    And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband''s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family
    of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz. &l2&rAnd Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi,
    Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I
    shall'
  '16': 'find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. &l3&rAnd she went, and
    came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on
    a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
    &l4&rAnd, behold, Boaz'
  '17': came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The Lord be with you. And they answered him, The Lord bless thee. &l5&rThen said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? &l6&rAnd the servant that was set over the reapers
  '18': 'answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out
    of the country of Moab: &l7&rAnd she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather
    after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from
    the morning until now,'
  '19': 'that she tarried a little in the house. &l8&rThen said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest
    thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence,
    but abide here fast by my maidens: &l9&rLet thine eyes be on the field that they
    do reap, and go'
  '20': 'thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch
    thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which
    the young men have drawn. &l10&rThen she fell on her face, and bowed herself to
    the ground, and said'
  '21': unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? &l11&rAnd Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of
  '22': 'thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the
    land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
    &l12&rThe Lord recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the Lord
    God of Israel,'
  '23': under whose wings thou art come to trust. &l13&rThen she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.
  '24': '&l14&rAnd Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the
    bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and
    he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left. &l15&rAnd
    when she was risen'
  '25': 'up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among
    the sheaves, and reproach her not: &l16&rAnd let fall also some of the handfuls
    of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.
    &l17&rSo she'
  '26': 'gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it
    was about an ephah of barley. &l18&rAnd she took it up, and went into the city:
    and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave
    to her that she had'
  '27': reserved after she was sufficed. &l19&rAnd her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The
  '28': man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz. &l20&rAnd Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the Lord, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our
  '29': next kinsmen. &l21&rAnd Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest. &l22&rAnd Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his
  '30': maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field. &l23&rSo she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.
  '31': 'Chapter 3

    Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest
    for thee, that it may be well with thee? &l2&rAnd now is not Boaz of our kindred,
    with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the'
  '32': 'threshingfloor. &l3&rWash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy
    raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known
    unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking. &l4&rAnd it shall
    be, when he lieth down,'
  '33': that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do. &l5&rAnd she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do. &l6&rAnd she went down unto the
  '34': 'floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her. &l7&rAnd
    when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at
    the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and
    laid her down. &l8&rAnd'
  '35': 'it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself:
    and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. &l9&rAnd he said, Who art thou? And she
    answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid;
    for thou art a near'
  '36': 'kinsman. &l10&rAnd he said, Blessed be thou of the Lord, my daughter: for
    thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch
    as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich. &l11&rAnd now, my daughter,
    fear not; I will'
  '37': 'do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know
    that thou art a virtuous woman. &l12&rAnd now it is true that I am thy near kinsman:
    howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. &l13&rTarry this night, and it shall
    be in the'
  '38': 'morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let
    him do the kinsman''s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee,
    then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the Lord liveth: lie down until
    the morning.'
  '39': '&l14&rAnd she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one
    could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the
    floor. &l15&rAlso he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it.
    And when she held'
  '40': 'it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went
    into the city. &l16&rAnd when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art
    thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her. &l17&rAnd
    she said, These six'
  '41': 'measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother
    in law. &l18&rThen said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter
    will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this
    day.'
  '42': 'Chapter 4

    Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman
    of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit
    down here. And he turned aside, and sat down. &l2&rAnd he took ten men of the
    elders of'
  '43': 'the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down. &l3&rAnd he said
    unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth
    a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech''s: &l4&rAnd I thought to advertise
    thee, saying, Buy'
  '44': 'it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt
    redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may
    know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he
    said, I will redeem it.'
  '45': '&l5&rThen said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi,
    thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up
    the name of the dead upon his inheritance. &l6&rAnd the kinsman said, I cannot
    redeem it for myself,'
  '46': 'lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot
    redeem it. &l7&rNow this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming
    and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe,
    and gave it'
  '47': 'to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel. &l8&rTherefore the
    kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe. &l9&rAnd Boaz
    said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that
    I have bought all that'
  '48': was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi. &l10&rMoreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not
  '49': 'cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses
    this day. &l11&rAnd all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said,
    We are witnesses. The Lord make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel
    and like'
  '50': 'Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah,
    and be famous in Bethlehem: &l12&rAnd let thy house be like the house of Pharez,
    whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this
    young woman.'

    &l13&rSo Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the
    Lord gave her conception, and she bare a son. &l14&rAnd the women said unto Naomi,
    Blessed be the Lord, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman,'
  '2': 'that his name may be famous in Israel. &l15&rAnd he shall be unto thee a restorer
