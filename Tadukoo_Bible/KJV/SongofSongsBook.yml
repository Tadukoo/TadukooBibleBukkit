  '1': 'Chapter 1

    The song of songs, which is Solomon''s. &l2&rLet him kiss me with the kisses of
    his mouth: for thy love is better than wine. &l3&rBecause of the savour of thy
    good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins
    love thee.'
  '2': ' &l4&rDraw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers:
    we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine:
    the upright love thee. &l5&rI am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
    as the tents'
  '3': 'of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. &l6&rLook not upon me, because I am
    black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother''s children were angry with
    me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not
    kept. &l7&rTell me, O'
  '4': 'thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock
    to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of
    thy companions? &l8&rIf thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way
    forth by the footsteps'
  '5': of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents. &l9&rI have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots. &l10&rThy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold. &l11&rWe will make thee borders
  '6': of gold with studs of silver. &l12&rWhile the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof. &l13&rA bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts. &l14&rMy beloved is unto me as a cluster
  '7': 'of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi. &l15&rBehold, thou art fair, my love;
    behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves'' eyes. &l16&rBehold, thou art fair, my
    beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green. &l17&rThe beams of our house are
    cedar, and our'
  '8': rafters of fir.
  '9': 'Chapter 2

    I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. &l2&rAs the lily among thorns,
    so is my love among the daughters. &l3&rAs the apple tree among the trees of the
    wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great'
  '10': 'delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. &l4&rHe brought me to the banqueting
    house, and his banner over me was love. &l5&rStay me with flagons, comfort me
    with apples: for I am sick of love. &l6&rHis left hand is under my head, and his
    right hand'
  '11': doth embrace me. &l7&rI charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please. &l8&rThe voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon
  '12': 'the hills. &l9&rMy beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth
    behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the
    lattice. &l10&rMy beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one,
    and come away.'
  '13': '&l11&rFor, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; &l12&rThe flowers
    appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of
    the turtle is heard in our land; &l13&rThe fig tree putteth forth her green figs,
    and the vines'
  '14': with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. &l14&rO my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy
  '15': 'countenance is comely. &l15&rTake us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil
    the vines: for our vines have tender grapes. &l16&rMy beloved is mine, and I am
    his: he feedeth among the lilies. &l17&rUntil the day break, and the shadows flee
    away, turn, my'
  '16': beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
  '17': 'Chapter 3

    By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found
    him not. &l2&rI will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the
    broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him
    not.'
  '18': '&l3&rThe watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye
    him whom my soul loveth? &l4&rIt was but a little that I passed from them, but
    I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I
    had brought him into my'
  '19': mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me. &l5&rI charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please. &l6&rWho is this that cometh out of the
  '20': wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant? &l7&rBehold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel. &l8&rThey all hold swords, being expert in
  '21': 'war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.
    &l9&rKing Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon. &l10&rHe made
    the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it
    of purple, the midst'
  '22': thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem. &l11&rGo forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
  '23': 'Chapter 4

    Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves'' eyes
    within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
    &l2&rThy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from
    the'
  '24': 'washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them. &l3&rThy
    lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like
    a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks. &l4&rThy neck is like the tower of
    David builded for'
  '25': an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. &l5&rThy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies. &l6&rUntil the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of
  '26': 'myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. &l7&rThou art all fair, my love;
    there is no spot in thee. &l8&rCome with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from
    Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the
    lions'' dens, from'
  '27': the mountains of the leopards. &l9&rThou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. &l10&rHow fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine!
  '28': 'and the smell of thine ointments than all spices! &l11&rThy lips, O my spouse,
    drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy
    garments is like the smell of Lebanon. &l12&rA garden inclosed is my sister, my
    spouse; a spring'
  '29': 'shut up, a fountain sealed. &l13&rThy plants are an orchard of pomegranates,
    with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard, &l14&rSpikenard and saffron; calamus
    and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief
    spices:'
  '30': '&l15&rA fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
    &l16&rAwake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the
    spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his
    pleasant fruits.'
  '31': 'Chapter 5

    I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with
    my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my
    milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. &l2&rI sleep, but
    my'
  '32': 'heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to
    me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew,
    and my locks with the drops of the night. &l3&rI have put off my coat; how shall
    I put it on? I have'
  '33': washed my feet; how shall I defile them? &l4&rMy beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him. &l5&rI rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the
  '34': 'handles of the lock. &l6&rI opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn
    himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could
    not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. &l7&rThe watchmen that went
    about the city'
  '35': found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. &l8&rI charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love. &l9&rWhat is thy beloved more than another beloved,
  '36': O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us? &l10&rMy beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand. &l11&rHis head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a
  '37': 'raven. &l12&rHis eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed
    with milk, and fitly set. &l13&rHis cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers:
    his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. &l14&rHis hands are as gold
    rings set'
  '38': 'with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires. &l15&rHis
    legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance
    is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. &l16&rHis mouth is most sweet: yea, he
    is altogether'
  '39': lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
  '40': 'Chapter 6

    Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved
    turned aside? that we may seek him with thee. &l2&rMy beloved is gone down into
    his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.'
  '41': '&l3&rI am my beloved''s, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
    &l4&rThou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as
    an army with banners. &l5&rTurn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome
    me: thy hair is as'
  '42': a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. &l6&rThy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them. &l7&rAs a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.
  '43': '&l8&rThere are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without
    number. &l9&rMy dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother,
    she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed
    her; yea, the'
  '44': queens and the concubines, and they praised her. &l10&rWho is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners? &l11&rI went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to
  '45': see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded. &l12&rOr ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib. &l13&rReturn, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it
  '46': were the company of two armies.
  '47': 'Chapter 7

    How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince''s daughter! the joints of thy
    thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman. &l2&rThy navel
    is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of
    wheat'
  '48': 'set about with lilies. &l3&rThy two breasts are like two young roes that
    are twins. &l4&rThy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools
    in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which
    looketh toward'
  '49': Damascus. &l5&rThine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries. &l6&rHow fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! &l7&rThis thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to
  '50': 'clusters of grapes. &l8&rI said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take
    hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine,
    and the smell of thy nose like apples;'

    &l9&rAnd the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down
    sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak. &l10&rI am my beloved''s,
    and his desire is toward me. &l11&rCome, my beloved, let us go forth'
  '2': 'into the field; let us lodge in the villages. &l12&rLet us get up early to
    the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear,

    O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should
    find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised. &l2&rI would
    lead thee, and bring thee into my mother''s house, who would instruct me: I would'
