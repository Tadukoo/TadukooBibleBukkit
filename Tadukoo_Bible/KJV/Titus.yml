ch1v7: For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;

ch1v14: Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
ch1v15: 'Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.'
ch1v16: They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
