  '1': 'Chapter 1

    Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith
    of God''s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
    &l2&rIn hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the
    world began;'
  '2': ' &l3&rBut hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is
    committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour; &l4&rTo Titus,
    mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father
    and the Lord'
  '3': 'Jesus Christ our Saviour. &l5&rFor this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou
    shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every
    city, as I had appointed thee: &l6&rIf any be blameless, the husband of one wife,
    having faithful'
  '4': children not accused of riot or unruly. &l7&rFor a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; &l8&rBut a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,
  '5': holy, temperate; &l9&rHolding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. &l10&rFor there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the
  '6': 'circumcision: &l11&rWhose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses,
    teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre''s sake. &l12&rOne of themselves,
    even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts,
    slow bellies.'
  '7': '&l13&rThis witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be
    sound in the faith; &l14&rNot giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of
    men, that turn from the truth. &l15&rUnto the pure all things are pure: but unto
    them that are'
  '8': defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. &l16&rThey profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
  '9': 'Chapter 2

    But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: &l2&rThat the aged men
    be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. &l3&rThe
    aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false
    accusers,'
  '10': not given to much wine, teachers of good things; &l4&rThat they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, &l5&rTo be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God
  '11': 'be not blasphemed. &l6&rYoung men likewise exhort to be sober minded. &l7&rIn
    all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness,
    gravity, sincerity, &l8&rSound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that
    is of the'
  '12': contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. &l9&rExhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; &l10&rNot purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may
  '13': adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. &l11&rFor the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, &l12&rTeaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
  '14': world; &l13&rLooking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; &l14&rWho gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
  '15': works. &l15&rThese things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
  '16': 'Chapter 3

    Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates,
    to be ready to every good work, &l2&rTo speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers,
    but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men. &l3&rFor we ourselves also were'
  '17': sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. &l4&rBut after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, &l5&rNot by works of righteousness
  '18': which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; &l6&rWhich he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; &l7&rThat being justified by his grace, we should be made
  '19': heirs according to the hope of eternal life. &l8&rThis is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.
  '20': '&l9&rBut avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings
    about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. &l10&rA man that is an heretick
    after the first and second admonition reject; &l11&rKnowing that he that is such
    is'
  '21': 'subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself. &l12&rWhen I shall send
    Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for
    I have determined there to winter. &l13&rBring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on
    their journey'
  '22': diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. &l14&rAnd let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. &l15&rAll that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
