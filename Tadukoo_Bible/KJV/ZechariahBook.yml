  '1': 'Chapter 1

    In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto
    Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, &l2&rThe
    Lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers. &l3&rTherefore say thou unto
    them,'
  '2': Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. &l4&rBe ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Turn ye now from your
  '3': 'evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto
    me, saith the Lord. &l5&rYour fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they
    live for ever? &l6&rBut my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants
    the prophets, did'
  '4': they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the Lord of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us. &l7&rUpon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which
  '5': is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, &l8&rI saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that
  '6': were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white. &l9&rThen said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be. &l10&rAnd the man that stood among the myrtle trees
  '7': answered and said, These are they whom the Lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth. &l11&rAnd they answered the angel of the Lord that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the
  '8': earth sitteth still, and is at rest. &l12&rThen the angel of the Lord answered and said, O Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?
  '9': '&l13&rAnd the Lord answered the angel that talked with me with good words
    and comfortable words. &l14&rSo the angel that communed with me said unto me,
    Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and
    for Zion with a great'
  '10': 'jealousy. &l15&rAnd I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at
    ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
    &l16&rTherefore thus saith the Lord; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies:
    my house shall be'
  '11': built in it, saith the Lord of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. &l17&rCry yet, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the Lord shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet
  '12': choose Jerusalem. &l18&rThen lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. &l19&rAnd I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. &l20&rAnd the
  '13': 'Lord shewed me four carpenters. &l21&rThen said I, What come these to do?
    And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that
    no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the
    horns of the Gentiles,'
  '14': which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.
  '15': 'Chapter 2

    I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line
    in his hand. &l2&rThen said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure
    Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.'
  '16': '&l3&rAnd, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel
    went out to meet him, &l4&rAnd said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying,
    Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and
    cattle'
  '17': 'therein: &l5&rFor I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round
    about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. &l6&rHo, ho, come forth, and
    flee from the land of the north, saith the Lord: for I have spread you abroad
    as the four winds of the'
  '18': 'heaven, saith the Lord. &l7&rDeliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with
    the daughter of Babylon. &l8&rFor thus saith the Lord of hosts; After the glory
    hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth
    the apple of his'
  '19': 'eye. &l9&rFor, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be
    a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent
    me. &l10&rSing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell
    in the midst of thee,'
  '20': 'saith the Lord. &l11&rAnd many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that
    day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt
    know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee. &l12&rAnd the Lord shall inherit
    Judah his'
  '21': 'portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. &l13&rBe silent,
    O all flesh, before the Lord: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.'
  '22': 'Chapter 3

    And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord,
    and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. &l2&rAnd the Lord said unto
    Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem
    rebuke'
  '23': 'thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? &l3&rNow Joshua was clothed
    with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. &l4&rAnd he answered and spake
    unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him.
    And unto him'
  '24': he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. &l5&rAnd I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel
  '25': of the Lord stood by. &l6&rAnd the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua, saying, &l7&rThus saith the Lord of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I
  '26': 'will give thee places to walk among these that stand by. &l8&rHear now, O
    Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are
    men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch. &l9&rFor
    behold the stone'
  '27': 'that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold,
    I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove
    the iniquity of that land in one day. &l10&rIn that day, saith the Lord of hosts,
    shall ye call every'
  '28': man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.
  '29': 'Chapter 4

    And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened
    out of his sleep. &l2&rAnd said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked,
    and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and'
  '30': 'his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon
    the top thereof: &l3&rAnd two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the
    bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. &l4&rSo I answered and spake to
    the angel that'
  '31': talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord? &l5&rThen the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. &l6&rThen he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto
  '32': 'Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the
    Lord of hosts. &l7&rWho art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt
    become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings,
    crying, Grace, grace'
  '33': unto it. &l8&rMoreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, &l9&rThe hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. &l10&rFor who hath
  '34': despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth. &l11&rThen answered I, and said unto him, What are
  '35': these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof? &l12&rAnd I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?
  '36': '&l13&rAnd he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I
    said, No, my lord. &l14&rThen said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand
    by the Lord of the whole earth.'
  '37': 'Chapter 5

    Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.
    &l2&rAnd he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll;
    the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. &l3&rThen
    said'
  '38': 'he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole
    earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according
    to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according
    to it. &l4&rI will bring'
  '39': 'it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the
    thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall
    remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof
    and the stones'
  '40': thereof. &l5&rThen the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth. &l6&rAnd I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their
  '41': 'resemblance through all the earth. &l7&rAnd, behold, there was lifted up
    a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.
    &l8&rAnd he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah;
    and he cast the weight'
  '42': 'of lead upon the mouth thereof. &l9&rThen lifted I up mine eyes, and looked,
    and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they
    had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the
    earth and the'
  '43': 'heaven. &l10&rThen said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these
    bear the ephah? &l11&rAnd he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of
    Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.'
  '44': 'Chapter 6

    And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four
    chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.
    &l2&rIn the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;'
  '45': ' &l3&rAnd in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled
    and bay horses. &l4&rThen I answered and said unto the angel that talked with
    me, What are these, my lord? &l5&rAnd the angel answered and said unto me, These
    are the four'
  '46': spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. &l6&rThe black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. &l7&rAnd
  '47': 'the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through
    the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they
    walked to and fro through the earth. &l8&rThen cried he upon me, and spake unto
    me, saying,'
  '48': Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. &l9&rAnd the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, &l10&rTake of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon,
  '49': and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; &l11&rThen take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; &l12&rAnd speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh
  '50': 'the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The Branch; and he
    shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord:'

    &l13&rEven he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory,

    and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. &l14&rAnd the crowns shall'
  '2': be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the Lord. &l15&rAnd they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the Lord, and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me

  '4': 'Chapter 7

    And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the Lord
    came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu; &l2&rWhen
    they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to'
  '5': pray before the Lord, &l3&rAnd to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the Lord of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? &l4&rThen came the word of the Lord
  '6': of hosts unto me, saying, &l5&rSpeak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me? &l6&rAnd when ye did eat, and
  '7': when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves? &l7&rShould ye not hear the words which the Lord hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men
  '8': 'inhabited the south and the plain? &l8&rAnd the word of the Lord came unto
    Zechariah, saying, &l9&rThus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Execute true
    judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: &l10&rAnd oppress
    not the widow, nor'
  '9': the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. &l11&rBut they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. &l12&rYea, they made their
  '10': 'hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words
    which the Lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore
    came a great wrath from the Lord of hosts. &l13&rTherefore it is come to pass,
    that as he cried, and'
  '11': 'they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the Lord
    of hosts: &l14&rBut I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom
    they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through
    nor returned: for'
  '12': they laid the pleasant land desolate.
  '13': 'Chapter 8

    Again the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying, &l2&rThus saith the Lord
    of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her
    with great fury. &l3&rThus saith the Lord; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell
    in'
  '14': 'the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and
    the mountain of the Lord of hosts the holy mountain. &l4&rThus saith the Lord
    of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem,
    and every man with'
  '15': his staff in his hand for very age. &l5&rAnd the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. &l6&rThus saith the Lord of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it
  '16': 'also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the Lord of hosts. &l7&rThus saith
    the Lord of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from
    the west country; &l8&rAnd I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst
    of Jerusalem: and'
  '17': they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness. &l9&rThus saith the Lord of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of
  '18': 'the house of the Lord of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
    &l10&rFor before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast;
    neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction:
    for I set all men'
  '19': every one against his neighbour. &l11&rBut now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the Lord of hosts. &l12&rFor the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and
  '20': the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. &l13&rAnd it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall
  '21': 'be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong. &l14&rFor thus saith
    the Lord of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to
    wrath, saith the Lord of hosts, and I repented not: &l15&rSo again have I thought
    in these days to'
  '22': 'do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. &l16&rThese
    are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour;
    execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates: &l17&rAnd let none of you
    imagine evil in your'
  '23': 'hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things
    that I hate, saith the Lord. &l18&rAnd the word of the Lord of hosts came unto
    me, saying, &l19&rThus saith the Lord of hosts; The fast of the fourth month,
    and the fast of the'
  '24': fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. &l20&rThus saith the Lord of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come
  '25': 'people, and the inhabitants of many cities: &l21&rAnd the inhabitants of
    one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the Lord,
    and to seek the Lord of hosts: I will go also. &l22&rYea, many people and strong
    nations shall come'
  '26': to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the Lord. &l23&rThus saith the Lord of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is
  '27': 'a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.'
  '28': 'Chapter 9

    The burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall

    be toward the Lord. &l2&rAnd Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon,
    though'
  '29': it be very wise. &l3&rAnd Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. &l4&rBehold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with
  '30': fire. &l5&rAshkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. &l6&rAnd a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod,

  '3': flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. &l8&rThree shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. &l9&rThen said I, I will not feed
  '4': 'you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be
    cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. &l10&rAnd I took
    my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which
    I had made with all'
  '5': 'the people. &l11&rAnd it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock
    that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord. &l12&rAnd I said unto
    them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed
    for my price'
  '6': 'thirty pieces of silver. &l13&rAnd the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the
    potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces
    of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord. &l14&rThen I
    cut asunder mine'
  '7': other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. &l15&rAnd the Lord said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. &l16&rFor, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit
  '8': 'those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that
    is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the
    fat, and tear their claws in pieces. &l17&rWoe to the idol shepherd that leaveth
    the flock! the'
  '9': 'sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean
    dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.'
  '10': 'Chapter 12

    The burden of the word of the Lord for Israel, saith the Lord, which stretcheth
    forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit
    of man within him. &l2&rBehold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto
    all'
  '11': 'the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah
    and against Jerusalem. &l3&rAnd in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome
    stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces,
    though all the people'
  '12': 'of the earth be gathered together against it. &l4&rIn that day, saith the
    Lord, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness:
    and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse
    of the people with'
  '13': blindness. &l5&rAnd the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the Lord of hosts their God. &l6&rIn that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a
  '14': 'torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about,
    on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her
    own place, even in Jerusalem. &l7&rThe Lord also shall save the tents of Judah
    first, that the'
  '15': glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah. &l8&rIn that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the
  '16': house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the Lord before them. &l9&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. &l10&rAnd I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
  '17': 'inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they
    shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one
    mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is
    in bitterness for his'
  '18': firstborn. &l11&rIn that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. &l12&rAnd the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the
  '19': family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; &l13&rThe family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; &l14&rAll the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives
  '20': apart.
  '21': 'Chapter 13

    In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the
    inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. &l2&rAnd it shall come to
    pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the
    idols'
  '22': 'out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause
    the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. &l3&rAnd it shall
    come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother
    that begat him shall'
  '23': 'say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of
    the Lord: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through
    when he prophesieth. &l4&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets
    shall be ashamed'
  '24': 'every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear
    a rough garment to deceive: &l5&rBut he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman;
    for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth. &l6&rAnd one shall say unto him,
    What are'
  '25': 'these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was
    wounded in the house of my friends. &l7&rAwake, O sword, against my shepherd,
    and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd,
    and the sheep shall'
  '26': 'be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones. &l8&rAnd it
    shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts therein shall
    be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein. &l9&rAnd I will bring
    the third part'
  '27': 'through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try
    them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will
    say, It is my people: and they shall say, The Lord is my God.'
  '28': 'Chapter 14

    Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst
    of thee. &l2&rFor I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the
    city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of
    the'
  '29': city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. &l3&rThen shall the Lord go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle. &l4&rAnd his feet shall stand in that day upon
  '30': the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and
  '31': 'half of it toward the south. &l5&rAnd ye shall flee to the valley of the
    mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall
    flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of
    Judah: and the Lord my'
  '32': 'God shall come, and all the saints with thee. &l6&rAnd it shall come to pass
    in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark: &l7&rBut it shall be
    one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day, nor night: but it shall come
    to pass, that at'
  '33': 'evening time it shall be light. &l8&rAnd it shall be in that day, that living
    waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half
    of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be. &l9&rAnd the
    Lord shall be'
  '34': 'king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name
    one. &l10&rAll the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of
    Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin''s
    gate unto the place'
  '35': of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses. &l11&rAnd men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited. &l12&rAnd this shall be the plague
  '36': wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
  '37': '&l13&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the
    Lord shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his
    neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour. &l14&rAnd
    Judah also shall'
  '38': fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. &l15&rAnd so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts
  '39': that shall be in these tents, as this plague. &l16&rAnd it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of
  '40': tabernacles. &l17&rAnd it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain. &l18&rAnd if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no
  '41': rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. &l19&rThis shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
  '42': '&l20&rIn that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness Unto
    The Lord; and the pots in the Lord''s house shall be like the bowls before the
    altar. &l21&rYea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the
    Lord of hosts: and'
  '43': 'all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein:
    and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord
    of hosts.'
