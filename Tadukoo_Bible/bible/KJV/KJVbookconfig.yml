  '1': "Chapter 1\n In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 And\
    \ the earth was without form, and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep.\
    \ 3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4 And God saw the light,\
    \ that it was good: "
  '2': 'and God divided the light from the darkness.  5 And God called the light Day,
    and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first
    day. 6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and
    let it divide the '
  '3': 'waters from the waters.  7 And God made the firmament and divided the waters
    which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:
    and it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
    morning were the '
  '4': 'second day.  9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
    unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 10 And God called
    the dry land Earth and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and
    God saw that it '
  '5': 'was good.  11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
    seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself,
    upon the earth: and it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb
    yielding seed '
  '6': 'after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after
    his kind: and God saw that it was good.  13 And the evening and the morning were
    the third day. 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
    to divide the '
  '7': 'day from the night and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days,
    and years:  15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give
    light upon the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made two great lights the greater
    light to rule '
  '8': 'the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  17
    And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
    18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the
    darkness: and God '
  '9': 'saw that it was good.  19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth
    day. 20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature
    that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of
    heaven. 21 And God '
  '10': 'created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters
    brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind:
    and God saw that it was good.  22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and
    multiply, and '
  '11': 'fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.  23 And
    the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 24 And God said, Let the earth
    bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and
    beast of the earth '
  '12': 'after his kind: and it was so.  25 And God made the beast of the earth after
    his kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth
    after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 26 And God said, Let us make man
    in our image, '
  '13': 'after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
    and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and
    over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  27 So God created man
    in his own image, in the '
  '14': 'image of God created he him male and female created he them.  28 And God
    blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
    the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
    the fowl of the air, and '
  '15': 'over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  29 And God said, Behold,
    I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth,
    and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall
    be for meat. '
  '16': '30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to
    every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given
    every green herb for meat: and it was so.  31 And God saw every thing that he
    had made, and, behold, it '
  '17': 'was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. '
  '18': "\nChapter 2\n Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host\
    \ of them. 2 And on the seventh day God ended the work which he had made and he\
    \ rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 3 And God blessed\
    \ the seventh day, and "
  '19': 'sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God
    created and made.  4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth
    when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
    5 And every '
  '20': 'plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field
    before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and
    there was not a man to till the ground.  6 But there went up a mist from the earth,
    and watered the '
  '21': 'whole face of the ground.  7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the
    ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living
    soul. 8 And the LORD God planted a garden, eastward in Eden and there he put the
    man whom he had '
  '22': 'formed.  9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that
    is pleasant to the sight, and good for food the tree of life also in the midst
    of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 10 And a river went
    out of Eden to water '
  '23': 'the garden and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.  11
    The name of the first is Pison that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah,
    where there is gold 12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and
    the onyx stone. '
  '24': '13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth
    the whole land of Ethiopia.  14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that
    is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
    15 And the LORD '
  '25': 'God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to
    keep it.  16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
    garden thou mayest freely eat: 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and
    evil, thou shalt not eat '
  '26': 'of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.  18
    And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone I will make
    him an help meet for him. 19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast
    of the field, and '
  '27': 'every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call
    them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.  20
    And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast
    of the '
  '28': 'field but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.  21 And the
    LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one
    of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof 22 And the rib, which the
    LORD God had taken from '
  '29': 'man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.  23 And Adam said, This
    is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because
    she was taken out of Man. 24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother,
    and shall '
  '30': 'cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.  25 And they were both
    naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.'
  '31': "\nChapter 3\n Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field\
    \ which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,\
    \ Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden? 2 And the woman said unto the serpent,\
    \ We may eat of the fruit "
  '32': 'of the trees of the garden:  3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the
    midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch
    it, lest ye die. 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
    5 For God doth '
  '33': 'know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and
    ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  6 And when the woman saw that the
    tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
    desired to make one '
  '34': 'wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her
    husband with her and he did eat.  7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and
    they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
    aprons. 8 And '
  '35': 'they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of
    the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God
    amongst the trees of the garden.  9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said
    unto him, Where art '
  '36': 'thou?  10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
    because I was naked and I hid myself. 11 And he said, Who told thee that thou
    wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest
    not eat? 12 And '
  '37': 'the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the
    tree, and I did eat.  13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that
    thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 14
    And the LORD God '
  '38': 'said unto the serpant, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above
    all cattle, and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go, and
    dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  15 And I will put enmity between
    thee and the woman, '
  '39': 'and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt
    bruise his heel.  16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
    and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall
    be to thy husband, '
  '40': 'and he shall rule over thee.  17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast
    hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded
    thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow
    shalt thou '
  '41': 'eat of it all the days of thy life  18 Thorns also and thistles shall it
    bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field 19 In the sweat of
    thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground for out of it
    wast thou taken: for '
  '42': 'dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.  20 And Adam called his wife''s
    name Eve because she was the mother of all living. 21 Unto Adam also and to his
    wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. 22 And the LORD God
    said, Behold, '
  '43': 'the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put
    forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:  23
    Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground
    from whence he '
  '44': was taken.  24 So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
  '45': "\nChapter 4\n And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,\
    \ and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD 2 And she again bare his brother\
    \ Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 3\
    \ And in process of time it "
  '46': 'came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto
    the LORD.  4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the
    fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: 5 But unto
    Cain and to his '
  '47': 'offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his counterance
    fell.  6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy counterance
    fallen? 7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not
    well, sin lieth '
  '48': 'at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over
    him.  8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they
    were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. 9
    And the LORD said unto '
  '49': 'Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother''s
    keeper?  10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother''s blood
    crieth unto me from the ground. 11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which
    hath opened her '
  '50': mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;  12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

  '1': ' 13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
    14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from
    thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth;
    and it shall come '
  '2': 'to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.  15 And the LORD said
    unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.
    And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. 16 And
    Cain went '
  '3': 'out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east
    of Eden.  17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch; and he
    builded a city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 18 And unto Enoch was born Irad:
    and Irad begat '
  '4': 'Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.  19 And
    Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of
    the other Zillah. 20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in
    tents, and of such as '
  '5': 'have cattle.  21 And his brother''s name was Jubal: he was the father of all
    such as handle the harp and organ. 22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an
    instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was
    Naamah. 23 And '
  '6': 'Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech,
    hearken unto my speech for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man
    to my hurt.  24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
    25 And '
  '7': 'Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For
    God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.  26
    And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then
    began men to '
  '8': 'call upon the name of the LORD. '
  '9': "\nChapter 5\n This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that\
    \ God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 2 Male and female created\
    \ he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they\
    \ were created. 3 And Adam "
  '10': 'lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after
    his image; and called his name Seth:  4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten
    Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: 5 And all the
    days that Adam '
  '11': 'lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.  6 And Seth lived
    an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 7 And Seth lived after he begat Enos
    eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 8 And all the days
    of Seth were nine '
  '12': 'hundred and twelve years: and he died.  9 And Enos lived ninety years, and
    begat Cainan: 10 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen
    years, and begat sons and daughters: 11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred
    and five years: '
  '13': 'and he died.  12 And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel: 13
    And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and
    begat sons and daughters: 14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and
    ten years: and he died. '
  '14': '15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:  16 And Mahalaleel
    lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and
    daughters: 17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five
    years: and he '
  '15': 'died.  18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:
    19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and
    daughters: 20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years:
    and he died. 21 '
  '16': 'And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:  22 And Enoch
    walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons
    and daughters: 23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five
    years: 24 And Enoch '
  '17': 'walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.  25 And Methuselah lived
    an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech. 26 And Methuselah lived after
    he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:
    27 And all the '
  '18': 'days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years, and he died.  28
    And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 29 And he called
    his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil
    of our hands, '
  '19': 'because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.  30 And Lamech lived after
    he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:
    31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and
    he died. 32 And Noah '
  '20': 'was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth. '
  '21': "\nChapter 6\n And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face\
    \ of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 2 That the sons of God saw\
    \ tha daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which\
    \ they chose. 3 And the LORD "
  '22': 'said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh:
    yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.  4 There were giants in the
    earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the
    daughters of men, '
  '23': 'and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of
    old, men of renown.  5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the
    earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
    6 And it '
  '24': 'repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at
    his heart.  7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
    face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls
    of the air; for it '
  '25': 'repenteth me that I have made them.  8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of
    the LORD. 9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was just a man and perfect
    in his generations, and Noah walked with God. 10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem,
    Ham, and Japheth. '
  '26': '11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.  12
    And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had
    corrupted his way upon the earth. 13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh
    is come '
  '27': 'before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold,
    I will destroy them with the earth.  14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms
    shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
    15 And this is the '
  '28': 'fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three
    hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.  16
    A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above;
    and the door '
  '29': 'of the ark shalt thou set in the side therof; with lower, second, and third
    stories shalt thou make it.  17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters
    upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under
    heaven; and '
  '30': 'every thing that is in the earth shall die.  18 But with thee will I establish
    my convenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife,
    and thy sons'' wives with thee. 19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two
    of every sort '
  '31': 'shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be
    male and female.  20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind,
    of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come
    unto thee, to keep '
  '32': them alive.  21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
  '33': "\nChapter 7\n And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into\
    \ the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. 2 Of every\
    \ clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and\
    \ of beasts that are not "
  '34': 'clean by two, the male and his female.  3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens,
    the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 4
    For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and
    forty nights; and '
  '35': 'every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face
    of the earth.  5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
    6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
    7 And Noah went in, '
  '36': 'and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'' wives with him, into the ark,
    because of the waters of the flood.  8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are
    not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 9 There
    went in two and two '
  '37': 'unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.  10
    And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the
    earth. 11 In the six hundredth year of Noah''s life, in the second month, the
    seventeenth day '
  '38': 'of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken
    up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  12 And the rain was upon the earth
    forty days and forty nights. 13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and
    Ham, and Japheth, the '
  '39': 'sons of Noah, and Noah''s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them,
    into the ark;  14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after
    their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind,
    and every fowl '
  '40': 'after his kind, every bird of every sort.  15 And they went in unto Noah
    into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life. 16 And
    they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded
    him: and the LORD shut him '
  '41': 'in.  17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased,
    and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 18 And the waters prevailed,
    and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the
    waters. '
  '42': '19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high
    hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.  20 Fifteen cubits upward
    did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 21 And all flesh died
    that moved upon the '
  '43': 'earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing
    that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:  22 All in whose nostrils was the
    breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. 23 And every living subtance
    was destroyed '
  '44': 'which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping
    things, and the fowl of heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah
    only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.  24 And the waters
    prevailed upon '
  '45': 'the earth an hundred and fifty days. '
  '46': "\nChapter 8\n And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the\
    \ cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth,\

    opened the window of '

    to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8 Also he sent

    hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. '

  '18': ' 18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham,

    and he planted '

    within his tent. 22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,

    laid it upon '

    \ And the sons of "
  '24': 'Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.  4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah,

    6 And '

    of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons

    one in the earth. 9 He '

    the mighty hunter before the Lord.  10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel,

    Philistim,) and '
  '28': 'Caphtorim.  15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 16 And the
    Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite,
    and the Sinite, 18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and
    afterward were the '

    was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom,

    Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth

    Sheba, 29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
    30 And their '
  '33': 'dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.  31
    These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their
    lands, after their nations. 32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after
    their generations, '
  '34': 'in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after
    the flood. '
  '35': "\nChapter 11\n And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.\
    \ 2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain\
    \ in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 3 And they said one to another,\
    \ Go to, let us make brick, "
  '36': 'and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they
    for morter.  4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose
    top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad
    upon the face of '
  '37': 'the whole earth.  5 And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower,
    which the children of men builded. 6 And the Lord said, Behold, the people is
    one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing
    will be restrained from '
  '38': 'them, which they have imagined to do.  7 Go to, let us go down, and there
    confound their language, that they may not understand one another''s speech. 8
    So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth:
    and they left off to '
  '39': 'build the city.  9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the
    Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the
    Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. 10 These are the generations
    of Shem: Shem was '
  '40': 'an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:  11 And
    Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
    12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 13 And Arphaxad
    lived after he '

    four and thirty '

    nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah
    an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. 26 And Terah lived
    seventy years, and '

    wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.  30

    against another: but '
  '40': 'the birds divided he not.  11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases,
    Abram drove them away. 12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon
    Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. 13 And he said unto
    Abram, Know of a '
  '41': 'surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and
    shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;  14 And also
    that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come
    out with great '
  '42': 'substance.  15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried
    in a good old age. 16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again:
    for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. 17 And it came to pass, that,
    when the sun '
  '43': 'went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp
    that passed between those pieces.  18 In the same day the Lord made a covenant
    with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt
    unto the great river, '
  '44': 'the river Euphrates:  19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
    20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 21 And the Amorites,
    and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.'
  '45': "\nChapter 16\n Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an\
    \ handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. 2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold\
    \ now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid;\
    \ it may be that I may "
  '46': 'obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.  3 And
    Sarai Abram''s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten
    years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
    4 And he went in unto '
  '47': 'Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress
    was despised in her eyes.  5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee:
    I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived,
    I was despised in '
  '48': 'her eyes: the Lord judge between me and thee.  6 But Abram said unto Sarai,
    Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai
    dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. 7 And the angel of the Lord found
    her by a fountain '
  '49': 'of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.  8 And he
    said, Hagar, Sarai''s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And
    she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. 9 And the angel of the Lord
    said unto her, Return '
  '50': to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.  10 And the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

    quickly three '

    ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young

    to the time of life; '
  '24': 'and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent
    door, which was behind him.  11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken
    in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. 12 Therefore
    Sarah laughed within '

    old also?  13 And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,

    Lord? At the time '
  '26': 'appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah
    shall have a son.  15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
    And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. 16 And the men rose up from thence, and
    looked toward '
  '27': 'Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.  17 And the Lord
    said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; 18 Seeing that Abraham
    shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth
    shall be blessed in '
  '28': 'him?  19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household
    after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment;
    that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. 20 And
    the Lord said, '
  '29': 'Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is
    very grievous;  21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
    according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. 22
    And the men turned '
  '30': 'their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before
    the Lord.  23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous
    with the wicked? 24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt
    thou also '
  '31': 'destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?  25
    That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the
    wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee:
    Shall not the Judge '
  '32': 'of all the earth do right?  26 And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty
    righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. 27
    And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto
    the Lord, which am but '
  '33': 'dust and ashes:  28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
    wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there
    forty and five, I will not destroy it. 29 And he spake unto him yet again, and
    said, Peradventure '
  '34': 'there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty''s
    sake.  30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak:
    Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it,
    if I find thirty '
  '35': 'there.  31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
    Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not
    destroy it for twenty''s sake. 32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and
    I will speak yet but '
  '36': 'this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not
    destroy it for ten''s sake.  33 And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left
    communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.'
  '37': "\nChapter 19\n And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in\

    \ I pray you, into your "
  '38': 'servant''s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise
    up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street
    all night.  3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and
    entered into '
  '39': 'his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they
    did eat.  4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom,
    compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
    5 And they '
  '40': 'called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee
    this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.  6 And Lot went out
    at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, 7 And said, I pray you, brethren,
    do not so '
  '41': 'wickedly.  8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let
    me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your
    eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow
    of my roof. 9 And they '
  '42': 'said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn,
    and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them.
    And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.  10

    door.  11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness,
    both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door. 12 And
    the men said unto '
  '44': 'Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters,

    will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face

    his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this

    thy life; look not '

    now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy,
    which thou hast '
  '49': 'shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest

    and upon Gomorrah '
  '2': 'brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven;  25 And he overthrew those

  '10': "\nChapter 20\n And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,\

  '11': 'to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a
    dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man''s wife.  4 But
    Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous
    nation? 5 Said he '
  '12': 'not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother:
    in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.  6 And
    God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity
    of thy heart; '
  '13': 'for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee
    not to touch her.  7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,

    early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in
    their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and
    said unto him, What '
  '15': 'hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought
    on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not
    to be done.  10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast
    done this '
  '16': 'thing?  11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is
    not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife''s sake. 12 And yet indeed
    she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my
    mother; and she became '
  '17': 'my wife.  13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father''s
    house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me;
    at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. 14 And Abimelech
    took '
  '18': 'sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham,
    and restored him Sarah his wife.  15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before

    given thy '
  '19': 'brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of
    the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.  17
    So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants;

    \ the name of his son "
  '22': 'that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.  4 And Abraham circumcised
    his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. 5 And Abraham was
    an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 6 And Sarah said,
    God hath made '
  '23': 'me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.  7 And she said, Who
    would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for
    I have born him a son in his old age. 8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and
    Abraham made a great '
  '24': 'feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.  9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar
    the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. 10 Wherefore she said
    unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman
    shall not be heir '
  '25': 'with my son, even with Isaac.  11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham''s
    sight because of his son. 12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous
    in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah
    hath said unto '
  '26': 'thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.  13
    And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
    14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water,
    and gave it '
  '27': 'unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away:
    and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.  15 And the water
    was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 16 And
    she went, and sat '
  '28': 'her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she
    said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and
    lift up her voice, and wept.  17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel
    of God called to '
  '29': 'Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not;
    for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.  18 Arise, lift up the lad,
    and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 19 And God opened
    her eyes, and she '
  '30': 'saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and
    gave the lad drink.  20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
    wilderness, and became an archer. 21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran:
    and his mother took him '
  '31': 'a wife out of the land of Egypt.  22 And it came to pass at that time, that
    Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying,
    God is with thee in all that thou doest: 23 Now therefore swear unto me here by
    God that thou wilt '
  '32': 'not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son''s son: but according
    to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the
    land wherein thou hast sojourned.  24 And Abraham said, I will swear. 25 And Abraham
    reproved '
  '33': 'Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech''s servants had violently
    taken away.  26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither
    didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day. 27 And Abraham took
    sheep and oxen, '
  '34': 'and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.  28 And Abraham
    set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham,
    What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 30 And he said,
    For '
  '35': 'these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness
    unto me, that I have digged this well.  31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba;
    because there they sware both of them. 32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba:
    then '
  '36': 'Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned
    into the land of the Philistines.  33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba,
    and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God. 34 And Abraham
    sojourned in the '
  '37': 'Philistines'' land many days. '
  '38': "\nChapter 22\n And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt\
    \ Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. 2 And he\
    \ said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee\
    \ into the land of Moriah; and "
  '39': 'offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will
    tell thee of.  3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
    and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood
    for the burnt '
  '40': 'offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.  4
    Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
    5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the
    lad will go yonder '
  '41': 'and worship, and come again to you.  6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt
    offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and
    a knife; and they went both of them together. 7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his
    father, and '
  '42': 'said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the
    fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  8 And Abraham
    said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went
    both of them together. '
  '43': '9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built
    an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid
    him on the altar upon the wood.  10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and
    took the knife to slay '
  '44': 'his son.  11 And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and
    said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. 12 And he said, Lay not thine
    hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou
    fearest God, seeing '
  '45': 'thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.  13 And Abraham lifted
    up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his
    horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering
    in the stead '
  '46': 'of his son.  14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as
    it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen. 15 And the
    angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, 16 And said,
    By myself have I '
  '47': 'sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not
    withheld thy son, thine only son:  17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and
    in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the
    sand which is upon the '
  '48': 'sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;  18 And in
    thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed
    my voice. 19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went
    together to '
  '49': 'Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.  20 And it came to pass after
    these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also
    born children unto thy brother Nahor; 21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother,
    and Kemuel the father '
  '50': 'of Aram,  22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
    23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham''s

    communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out

    may give me the cave of '
  '6': 'Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money
    as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst

    Abraham in '
  '7': 'the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate
    of his city, saying,  11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the
    cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people
    give I it thee: bury '
  '8': 'thy dead.  12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
    13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying,
    But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the
    field; take it of me, '
  '9': 'and I will bury my dead there.  14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto
    him, 15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver;
    what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. 16 And Abraham hearkened
    unto '
  '10': 'Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the
    audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with
    the merchant.  17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before
    Mamre, the '
  '11': 'field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the
    field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure  18 Unto Abraham
    for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went
    in at the gate of his '
  '12': 'city.  19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the
    field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. 20
    And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a
    possession of a '

  '14': "\nChapter 24\n And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the Lord\
    \ had blessed Abraham in all things. 2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant\

    \ my thigh: 3 And I will "
  '15': 'make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth,
    that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites,
    among whom I dwell:  4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and
    take a wife unto my '
  '16': 'son Isaac.  5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will
    not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto
    the land from whence thou camest? 6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that
    thou bring not my '
  '17': 'son thither again.  7 The Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father''s
    house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware

    not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only
    bring not my son thither again. 9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh
    of Abraham his master, '
  '19': 'and sware to him concerning that matter.  10 And the servant took ten camels
    of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were
    in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. 11
    And he made his '
  '20': 'camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the
    evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.  12 And he said O Lord
    God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness
    unto my master '
  '21': 'Abraham.  13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters

    the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may
    drink; and she shall '
  '22': 'say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that
    thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou
    hast shewed kindness unto my master.  15 And it came to pass, before he had done
    speaking, that, '
  '23': 'behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife
    of Nahor, Abraham''s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.  16 And the
    damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and
    she went down to the '
  '24': 'well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.  17 And the servant ran to meet
    her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. 18 And
    she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand,
    and gave him drink.'
  '25': ' 19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for
    thy camels also, until they have done drinking. 20 And she hasted, and emptied
    her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew
    for all his camels. '
  '26': '21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Lord had
    made his journey prosperous or not.  22 And it came to pass, as the camels had
    done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and
    two bracelets for her '
  '27': 'hands of ten shekels weight of gold;  23 And said, Whose daughter art thou?
    tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father''s house for us to lodge in?
    24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which
    she bare unto Nahor. '
  '28': '25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and
    room to lodge in.  26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the Lord.
    27 And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left
    destitute my master '
  '29': 'of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the Lord led me to the house
    of my master''s brethren.  28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother''s
    house these things. 29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and
    Laban ran out unto '
  '30': 'the man, unto the well.  30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring
    and bracelets upon his sister''s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah
    his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,
    behold, he stood by the '
  '31': 'camels at the well.  31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore
    standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
    32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw
    and provender '
  '32': 'for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men''s feet that were
    with him.  33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not
    eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on. 34 And he said, I am
    Abraham''s servant. 35 '
  '33': 'And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and
    he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and
    maidservants, and camels, and asses.  36 And Sarah my master''s wife bare a son
    to my master when she '
  '34': 'was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.  37 And my master made
    me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the
    Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: 38 But thou shalt go unto my father''s house,
    and to my kindred, '
  '35': 'and take a wife unto my son.  39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure
    the woman will not follow me. 40 And he said unto me, The Lord, before whom I
    walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take
    a wife for my son of my '
  '36': 'kindred, and of my father''s house:  41 Then shalt thou be clear from this
    my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt
    be clear from my oath. 42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord
    God of my master '
  '37': 'Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:  43 Behold, I stand by
    the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth
    to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher
    to drink; 44 And '
  '38': 'she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let
    the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my master''s son.  45
    And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with
    her pitcher on her '
  '39': 'shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto
    her, Let me drink, I pray thee.  46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher
    from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so
    I drank, and she made '
  '40': 'the camels drink also.  47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art
    thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor''s son, whom Milcah bare unto
    him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. 48
    And I bowed down my '
  '41': 'head, and worshipped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham,
    which had led me in the right way to take my master''s brother''s daughter unto
    his son.  49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me:
    and if not, tell me; '
  '42': 'that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.  50 Then Laban and Bethuel
    answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the Lord: we cannot speak unto thee
    bad or good. 51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her
    be thy master''s '
  '43': 'son''s wife, as the Lord hath spoken.  52 And it came to pass, that, when
    Abraham''s servant heard their words, he worshipped the Lord, bowing himself to
    the earth. 53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
    and raiment, and gave '
  '44': 'them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.  54
    And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all
    night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
    55 And her '
  '45': 'brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at
    the least ten; after that she shall go.  56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not,
    seeing the Lord hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
    57 And they said, We '
  '46': 'will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.  58 And they called Rebekah,
    and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. 59 And
    they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham''s servant, and
    his men. 60 And they '
  '47': 'blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother
    of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate
    them.  61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and
    followed the man: '
  '48': 'and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.  62 And Isaac came from the
    way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. 63 And Isaac went
    out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw,
    and, behold, the '
  '49': 'camels were coming.  64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw
    Isaac, she lighted off the camel. 65 For she had said unto the servant, What man
    is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is
    my master: therefore '

    was a plain man, dwelling in tents. 28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat
    of his venison: but '
  '15': 'Rebekah loved Jacob.  29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field,

    sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the Lord
    blessed him. 13 And the '
  '25': 'man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:  14
    For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants:
    and the Philistines envied him. 15 For all the wells which his father''s servants
    had digged '
  '26': 'in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and
    filled them with earth.  16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou
    art much mightier than we. 17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent
    in the valley of Gerar, '
  '27': 'and dwelt there.  18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they
    had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped
    them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by
    which his father had '
  '28': 'called them.  19 And Isaac''s servants digged in the valley, and found there
    a well of springing water. 20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac''s
    herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because
    they strove '
  '29': 'with him.  21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and
    he called the name of it Sitnah. 22 And he removed from thence, and digged another
    well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and
    he said, For now '
  '30': 'the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.  23
    And he went up from thence to Beersheba. 24 And the Lord appeared unto him the
    same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with
    thee, and will bless '
  '31': 'thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham''s sake.  25 And he builded
    an altar there, and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there:
    and there Isaac''s servants digged a well. 26 Then Abimelech went to him from
    Gerar, and '
  '32': 'Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.  27
    And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have
    sent me away from you? 28 And they said, We saw certainly that the Lord was with
    thee: and we said, '
  '33': 'Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us
    make a covenant with thee;  29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched
    thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away
    in peace: thou art '
  '34': 'now the blessed of the Lord.  30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat
    and drink. 31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another:
    and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 32 And it came
    to pass the same '
  '35': 'day, that Isaac''s servants came, and told him concerning the well which
    they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.  33 And he called it
    Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. 34 And Esau
    was forty years old when '
  '36': 'he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the
    daughter of Elon the Hittite:  35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to
    Rebekah.'
  '37': "\nChapter 27\n And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes\
    \ were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said\
    \ unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. 2 And he said, Behold\
    \ now, I am old, I know not "
  '38': 'the day of my death:  3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy
    quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 4 And make
    me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul
    may bless thee '
  '39': 'before I die.  5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And
    Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 6 And Rebekah spake
    unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother,
    saying, 7 Bring '
  '40': 'me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before
    the Lord before my death.  8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to
    that which I command thee. 9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two
    good kids of the '
  '41': 'goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:  10
    And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless
    thee before his death. 11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my
    brother is a '
  '42': 'hairy man, and I am a smooth man:  12 My father peradventure will feel me,
    and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and
    not a blessing. 13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:
    only obey my voice, and '
  '43': 'go fetch me them.  14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother:
    and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. 15 And Rebekah took
    goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put
    them upon '
  '44': 'Jacob her younger son:  16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats
    upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: 17 And she gave the savoury meat
    and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. 18 And
    he came unto his '
  '45': 'father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?  19
    And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according
    as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul
    may bless me. 20 '
  '46': 'And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly,
    my son? And he said, Because the Lord thy God brought it to me.  21 And Isaac
    said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether
    thou be my very son '
  '47': 'Esau or not.  22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,
    and said, The voice is Jacob''s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 23
    And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau''s
    hands: so he blessed '
  '48': 'him.  24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. 25 And
    he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son''s venison, that my soul
    may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought
    him wine and he drank. '
  '49': '26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.  27
    And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and
    blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which
    the Lord hath '
  '50': 'blessed:  28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness
    of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:'

    brethren, and let thy mother''s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that
    curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee. 30 And it came to pass, as
    soon as Isaac had made '
  '2': 'an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence
    of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.  31 And he
    also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his
    father, Let my '

    And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy
    firstborn Esau. 33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is
    he that hath taken '
  '4': 'venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and
    have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.  34 And when Esau heard the words

    father, Bless '

    for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold,
    now he '
  '6': 'hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing
    for me?  37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy
    lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and
    wine have I sustained '
  '7': 'him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  38 And Esau said unto his
    father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father.
    And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 39 And Isaac his father answered and said
    unto him, '
  '8': 'Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of
    heaven from above;  40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;
    and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break
    his yoke '
  '9': 'from off thy neck.  41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith
    his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my
    father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. 42 And these words of Esau
    her elder son '
  '10': 'were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and
    said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself,
    purposing to kill thee.  43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee
    thou to Laban my '

    that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence:
    why should I be '
  '12': 'deprived also of you both in one day?  46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am
    weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the
    daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what
    good shall my life do me?'
  '13': "\nChapter 28\n And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him,\
    \ and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 2\
    \ Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take\

    thee; that thou mayest '
  '15': 'inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.  5
    And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel
    the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob''s and Esau''s mother. 6 When Esau saw
    that Isaac had '
  '16': 'blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence;
    and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a

    to be his wife. 10 And '
  '18': Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.  11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
  '19': ' 12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top
    of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending
    on it. 13 And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of
    Abraham thy father, and '
  '20': 'the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and
    to thy seed;  14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt
    spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south:

    bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done
    that which I have spoken '
  '22': 'to thee of.  16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the
    Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. 17 And he was afraid, and said, How
    dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the
    gate of heaven. 18 '
  '23': 'And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put
    for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.  19
    And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called
    Luz at the '
  '24': 'first.  20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will
    keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put
    on, 21 So that I come again to my father''s house in peace; then shall the Lord
    be my God: 22 And '
  '25': 'this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God''s house: and of
    all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee. '
  '26': "\nChapter 29\n Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of\
    \ the people of the east. 2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and,\
    \ lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they\
    \ watered the flocks: and a "
  '27': 'great stone was upon the well''s mouth.  3 And thither were all the flocks
    gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well''s mouth, and watered the sheep,
    and put the stone again upon the well''s mouth in his place. 4 And Jacob said
    unto them, My '
  '28': 'brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.  5 And he said unto
    them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. 6 And he said
    unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter
    cometh with the '
  '29': 'sheep.  7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the
    cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
    8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till
    they roll the stone '
  '30': 'from the well''s mouth; then we water the sheep.  9 And while he yet spake
    with them, Rachel came with her father''s sheep; for she kept them. 10 And it
    came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother''s brother,
    and the sheep of Laban '
  '31': 'his mother''s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the
    well''s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother''s brother.  11 And Jacob
    kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 12 And Jacob told Rachel that
    he was her father''s '
  '32': 'brother, and that he was Rebekah''s son: and she ran and told her father.  13
    And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister''s son,
    that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to
    his house. And he told '
  '33': 'Laban all these things.  14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone
    and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. 15 And Laban said unto
    Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought?
    tell me, what '
  '34': 'shall thy wages be?  16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder
    was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 17 Leah was tender eyed; but
    Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. 18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I
    will serve thee seven '
  '35': 'years for Rachel thy younger daughter.  19 And Laban said, It is better that
    I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
    20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few
    days, for the love '
  '36': 'he had to her.  21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days
    are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. 22 And Laban gathered together all the
    men of the place, and made a feast. 23 And it came to pass in the evening, that
    he took Leah his '
  '37': 'daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.  24 And Laban
    gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid. 25 And it came to
    pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is
    this thou hast done unto '
  '38': 'me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled
    me?  26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger
    before the firstborn. 27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for
    the service which '
  '39': 'thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.  28 And Jacob did so, and
    fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. 29 And Laban
    gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. 30 And he went
    in also unto '
  '40': 'Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet
    seven other years.  31 And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her
    womb: but Rachel was barren. 32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called
    his name Reuben: '
  '41': 'for she said, Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore
    my husband will love me.  33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said,
    Because the Lord hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:
    and she called '
  '42': 'his name Simeon.  34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now
    this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:
    therefore was his name called Levi. 35 And she conceived again, and bare a son:
    and she said, Now '
  '43': 'will I praise the Lord: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing. '
  '44': "\nChapter 30\n And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel\

    \ who hath withheld from thee "
  '45': 'the fruit of the womb?  3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto
    her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. 4
    And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her. 5 And
    Bilhah conceived, and '
  '46': 'bare Jacob a son.  6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard
    my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan. 7 And Bilhah
    Rachel''s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 8 And Rachel said,
    With great '
  '47': 'wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she
    called his name Naphtali.  9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took
    Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 10 And Zilpah Leah''s maid bare Jacob
    a son. 11 And Leah '
  '48': 'said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.  12 And Zilpah Leah''s
    maid bare Jacob a second son. 13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters
    will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher. 14 And Reuben went in the
    days of wheat harvest, '
  '49': 'and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.
    Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son''s mandrakes.  15 And
    she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest
    thou take away '

  '16': 'maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses. '
  '17': "\nChapter 31\n And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath\
    \ taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath\
    \ he gotten all this glory. 2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and,\
    \ behold, it was not toward him "
  '18': 'as before.  3 And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers,
    and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. 4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel
    and Leah to the field unto his flock, 5 And said unto them, I see your father''s
    countenance, '
  '19': 'that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with
    me.  6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 7 And your
    father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him
    not to hurt me. 8 If '
  '20': 'he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled:
    and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle
    ringstraked.  9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
    them to me. 10 '
  '21': 'And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted
    up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the
    cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.  11 And the angel of God spake
    unto me in a dream, '
  '22': 'saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.  12 And he said, Lift up now thine
    eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled,
    and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. 13 I am the God of
    Bethel, where thou '
  '23': 'anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get
    thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.  14 And Rachel
    and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for
    us in our '
  '24': 'father''s house?  15 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold
    us, and hath quite devoured also our money. 16 For all the riches which God hath
    taken from our father, that is ours, and our children''s: now then, whatsoever
    God hath said unto '
  '25': 'thee, do.  17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
    18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten,
    the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac
    his father in the '
  '26': 'land of Canaan.  19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen
    the images that were her father''s. 20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban
    the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. 21 So he fled with all that
    he had; and he rose up, '
  '27': and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.  22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
  '28': ' 24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him,
    Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 25 Then Laban overtook
    Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren
    pitched in the '
  '29': 'mount of Gilead.  26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou
    hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken
    with the sword? 27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from
    me; and didst '
  '30': 'not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs,
    with tabret, and with harp?  28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my
    daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing. 29 It is in the power of
    my hand to do you hurt: '
  '31': 'but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed
    that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.  30 And now, though thou wouldest
    needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father''s house, yet wherefore
    hast thou '
  '32': 'stolen my gods?  31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:
    for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. 32
    With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern
    thou what '
  '33': 'is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had
    stolen them.  33 And Laban went into Jacob''s tent, and into Leah''s tent, and
    into the two maidservants'' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of
    Leah''s tent, and entered '
  '34': 'into Rachel''s tent.  34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in
    the camel''s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but
    found them not. 35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that
    I cannot rise up '
  '35': 'before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found
    not the images.  36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
    and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly
    pursued after me? '
  '36': '37 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy
    household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may
    judge betwixt us both.  38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and
    thy she goats have '
  '37': 'not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.  39 That
    which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my
    hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. 40 Thus
    I was; in the day the '
  '38': 'drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine
    eyes.  41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years
    for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my
    wages ten times. '
  '39': '42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac,
    had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine
    affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.  43 And Laban
    answered and said '
  '40': 'unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children,
    and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can
    I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have
    born?  44 Now '
  '41': 'therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for
    a witness between me and thee.  45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a
    pillar. 46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones,
    and made an heap: '
  '42': 'and they did eat there upon the heap.  47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha:
    but Jacob called it Galeed. 48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between
    me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 49 And Mizpah;
    for he said, The '
  '43': 'Lord watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.  50
    If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my
    daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. 51 And
    Laban said to Jacob, '
  '44': 'Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and
    thee:  52 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass
    over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar
    unto me, for '
  '45': 'harm.  53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father,
    judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. 54 Then Jacob
    offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they
    did eat bread, '
  '46': 'and tarried all night in the mount.  55 And early in the morning Laban rose
    up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed,
    and returned unto his place.'
  '47': "\nChapter 32\n And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\
    \ 2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name\
    \ of that place Mahanaim. 3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother\
    \ unto the land of Seir, "
  '48': 'the country of Edom.  4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak
    unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban,
    and stayed there until now: 5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants,
    and womenservants: '
  '49': 'and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.  6 And
    the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also
    he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. 7 Then Jacob was greatly
    afraid and '
  '50': 'distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks,
    and herds, and the camels, into two bands;  8 And said, If Esau come to the one
    company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.'

    13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand

    hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 15 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty
    kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. 16 And he delivered them
    into the hand of his '

    saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art
    thou? and '
  '6': 'whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?  18 Then thou shalt say,
    They be thy servant Jacob''s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold,
    also he is behind us. 19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all
    that followed '

    him.  20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said,
    I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will
    see his face; '
  '8': 'peradventure he will accept of me.  21 So went the present over before him:
    and himself lodged that night in the company. 22 And he rose up that night, and
    took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed
    over the ford Jabbok.'
  '9': ' 23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he
    had. 24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the
    breaking of the day. 25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he
    touched the hollow of his '
  '10': 'thigh; and the hollow of Jacob''s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled
    with him.  26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will
    not let thee go, except thou bless me. 27 And he said unto him, What is thy name?
    And he said, Jacob. '
  '11': '28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as
    a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.  29 And Jacob
    asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is
    it that thou dost '
  '12': 'ask after my name? And he blessed him there.  30 And Jacob called the name
    of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
    31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his
    thigh. 32 Therefore '
  '13': 'the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the
    hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob''s

  '15': 'Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.  3 And he
    passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he
    came near to his brother. 4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell
    on his neck, and '
  '16': 'kissed him: and they wept.  5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women
    and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children
    which God hath graciously given thy servant. 6 Then the handmaidens came near,
    they and their '
  '17': 'children, and they bowed themselves.  7 And Leah also with her children came
    near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed
    themselves. 8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And
    he said, These '

    my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. 10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee,
    if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for
    therefore I have '

    with me.  11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God
    hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and
    he took it. 12 And '
  '20': 'he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.  13

    I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children
    be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 15 And Esau said, Let
    me now leave with '

    me find grace in the sight of my lord.  16 So Esau returned that day on his way
    unto Seir. 17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made
    booths for his cattle: '
  '23': 'therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.  18 And Jacob came to
    Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram;
    and pitched his tent before the city. 19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where
    he had '

  '25': "\nChapter 34\n And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,\

    \ the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and\
    \ defiled her. 3 And his "
  '26': 'soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and
    spake kindly unto the damsel.  4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying,
    Get me this damsel to wife. 5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter:
    now his sons '
  '27': 'were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were
    come.  6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
    7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men
    were grieved, and '
  '28': 'they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with
    Jacob''s daughter: which thing ought not to be done.  8 And Hamor communed with
    them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you
    give her him to wife. '
  '29': '9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take
    our daughters unto you.  10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be
    before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. 11 And
    Shechem said unto her '
  '30': 'father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye
    shall say unto me I will give.  12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I
    will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. 13
    And the sons of Jacob '
  '31': 'answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had
    defiled Dinah their sister:  14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing,
    to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto
    us: 15 But in this '
  '32': 'will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you
    be circumcised;  16 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take
    your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
    17 But if ye will not '
  '33': 'hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we
    will be gone.  18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor''s son. 19
    And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob''s
    daughter: and he was '
  '34': 'more honourable than all the house of his father.  20 And Hamor and Shechem
    his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city,
    saying, 21 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land,
    and trade '
  '35': 'therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their
    daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.  22 Only herein
    will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every
    male among us be '
  '36': 'circumcised, as they are circumcised.  23 Shall not their cattle and their
    substance and every beast of their''s be our''s? only let us consent unto them,
    and they will dwell with us. 24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened
    all that went out of '
  '37': 'the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of
    the gate of his city.  25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were
    sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah''s brethren, took
    each man his sword, and '
  '38': 'came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.  26 And they slew Hamor
    and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem''s
    house, and went out. 27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the
    city, because they '
  '39': 'had defiled their sister.  28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and
    their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,
    29 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they
    captive, and spoiled even '
  '40': 'all that was in the house.  30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have
    troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites
    and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together
    against '
  '41': me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.  31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
  '42': "\nChapter 35\n And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell\

    \ to all that were with "
  '43': 'him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change
    your garments:  3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there
    an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me
    in the way which I '
  '44': 'went.  4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their
    hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under
    the oak which was by Shechem. 5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was
    upon the cities that '
  '45': 'were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.  6
    So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and
    all the people that were with him. 7 And he built there an altar, and called the
    place Elbethel: '
  '46': 'because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.  8
    But Deborah, Rebekah''s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an
    oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth. 9 And God appeared unto Jacob
    again, when he '

    up from him in '

    place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink

  '9': 'sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle,
    and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan;
    and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.  7 For their riches
    were more than '
  '10': 'that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers
    could not bear them because of their cattle.  8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir:
    Esau is Edom. 9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites
    in mount Seir: 10 '
  '11': 'These are the names of Esau''s sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of
    Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.  11 And the sons of Eliphaz
    were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz
    Esau''s son; and she '
  '12': 'bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau''s wife.  13 And
    these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were
    the sons of Bashemath Esau''s wife. 14 And these were the sons of Aholibamah,
    the daughter of Anah the '
  '13': 'daughter of Zibeon, Esau''s wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam,
    and Korah.  15 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn
    son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz, 16 Duke Korah, duke
    Gatam, and duke '

    are the sons of Esau, '
  '16': 'who is Edom, and these are their dukes.  20 These are the sons of Seir the
    Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, 21 And
    Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children
    of Seir in the land '
  '17': 'of Edom.  22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan''s
    sister was Timna. 23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath,

  '26': "\nChapter 37\n And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger,\
    \ in the land of Canaan. 2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen\
    \ years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the\
    \ sons of Bilhah, "
  '27': 'and with the sons of Zilpah, his father''s wives: and Joseph brought unto
    his father their evil report.  3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children,
    because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.
    4 And when his '
  '28': 'brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they
    hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.  5 And Joseph dreamed a dream,
    and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. 6 And he said unto
    them, Hear, I pray '
  '29': 'you, this dream which I have dreamed:  7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves
    in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your
    sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 8 And his brethren
    said to him, Shalt '
  '30': 'thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And
    they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.  9 And he dreamed
    yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed
    a dream more; and, '
  '31': 'behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.  10
    And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him,
    and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy
    mother and thy '
  '32': 'brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  11 And
    his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. 12 And his brethren
    went to feed their father''s flock in Shechem. 13 And Israel said unto Joseph,
    Do not thy brethren '
  '33': 'feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said
    to him, Here am I.  14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be
    well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So
    he sent him out of the '
  '34': 'vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.  15 And a certain man found him,
    and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What
    seekest thou? 16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where
    they feed their flocks. '
  '35': '17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us
    go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.  18
    And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired
    against him to '
  '36': 'slay him.  19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
    20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we
    will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become
    of his dreams. 21 And '
  '37': 'Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us
    not kill him.  22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into
    this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid
    him out of their '
  '38': 'hands, to deliver him to his father again.  23 And it came to pass, when
    Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his
    coat of many colours that was on him; 24 And they took him, and cast him into
    a pit: and the pit was '
  '39': 'empty, there was no water in it.  25 And they sat down to eat bread: and
    they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came
    from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry
    it down to Egypt. 26 '
  '40': 'And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother,
    and conceal his blood?  27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let
    not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren
    were content. 28 '
  '41': 'Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up
    Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of
    silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.  29 And Reuben returned unto the pit;
    and, behold, Joseph '
  '42': 'was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.  30 And he returned unto his
    brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? 31 And they took
    Joseph''s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;
    32 And they sent '
  '43': 'the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said,
    This have we found: know now whether it be thy son''s coat or no.  33 And he knew
    it, and said, It is my son''s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is
    without doubt rent in '
  '44': 'pieces.  34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
    and mourned for his son many days. 35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose
    up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go
    down into the grave '
  '45': unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.  36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.
  '46': "\nChapter 38\n And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from\
    \ his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 2\
    \ And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah;\
    \ and he took her, and went in "
  '47': 'unto her.  3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
    4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. 5 And
    she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was
    at Chezib, when she '
  '48': 'bare him.  6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
    7 And Er, Judah''s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord
    slew him. 8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother''s wife, and marry
    her, and raise up '
  '49': 'seed to thy brother.  9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and
    it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother''s wife, that he spilled it
    on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. 10 And the thing
    which he did displeased '
  '50': 'the Lord: wherefore he slew him also. '

  '1': ' 11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father''s
    house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also,
    as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father''s house. 12 And in
    process of time '
  '2': 'the daughter of Shuah Judah''s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went
    up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.  13
    And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to
    shear his sheep. 14 '
  '3': 'And she put her widow''s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail,
    and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath;
    for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.  15
    When Judah saw her, '
  '4': 'he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.  16 And
    he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto
    thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt
    thou give me, that '
  '5': 'thou mayest come in unto me?  17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from
    the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? 18 And
    he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets,
    and thy staff '
  '6': 'that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived
    by him.  19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put
    on the garments of her widowhood. 20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his
    friend the '
  '7': 'Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman''s hand: but he found her
    not.  21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that
    was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.
    22 And he returned to '
  '8': 'Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that
    there was no harlot in this place.  23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her,
    lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. 24 And
    it came to pass '
  '9': 'about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter
    in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom.
    And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.  25 When she was brought
    forth, she sent to '
  '10': 'her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child:
    and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets,
    and staff.  26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous
    than I; because '
  '11': 'that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.  27
    And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her
    womb. 28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand:
    and the midwife took '
  '12': 'and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.  29
    And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came
    out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore
    his name was called '
  '13': 'Pharez.  30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread
    upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.'
  '14': "\nChapter 39\n And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer\
    \ of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the\
    \ Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. 2 And the Lord was with Joseph,\
    \ and he was a "
  '15': 'prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.  3 And
    his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he
    did to prosper in his hand. 4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served
    him: and he made him '
  '16': 'overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.  5 And
    it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and
    over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian''s house for Joseph''s
    sake; and the blessing of '
  '17': 'the Lord was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.  6 And
    he left all that he had in Joseph''s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save
    the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.
    7 And it came to pass '
  '18': 'after these things, that his master''s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and
    she said, Lie with me.  8 But he refused, and said unto his master''s wife, Behold,
    my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all
    that he hath to my '
  '19': 'hand;  9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept
    back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do
    this great wickedness, and sin against God? 10 And it came to pass, as she spake
    to Joseph day by day, '
  '20': 'that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.  11 And
    it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business;
    and there was none of the men of the house there within. 12 And she caught him
    by his garment, '
  '21': 'saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got
    him out.  13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in
    her hand, and was fled forth, 14 That she called unto the men of her house, and
    spake unto them, '
  '22': 'saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in
    unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:  15 And it came to pass,
    when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with
    me, and fled, and got '
  '23': 'him out.  16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
    17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant,
    which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: 18 And it came to
    pass, as I lifted up '
  '24': 'my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.  19 And
    it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake
    unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was
    kindled. 20 And '
  '25': 'Joseph''s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the
    king''s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.  21 But the Lord
    was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the
    keeper of the prison. 22 '
  '26': 'And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph''s hand all the prisoners
    that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.  23
    The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because
    the Lord was '

  '28': "\nChapter 40\n And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of\
    \ the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. 2\
    \ And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the\
    \ butlers, and against the chief "
  '29': 'of the bakers.  3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of
    the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 4 And the captain
    of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued
    a season in ward. 5 And '
  '30': 'they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each
    man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of
    the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.  6 And Joseph came in unto
    them in the morning, and '
  '31': 'looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.  7 And he asked Pharaoh''s
    officers that were with him in the ward of his lord''s house, saying, Wherefore
    look ye so sadly to day? 8 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and
    there is no interpreter '
  '32': 'of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell
    me them, I pray you.  9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said
    to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 10 And in the vine were three
    branches: and it '
  '33': 'was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof
    brought forth ripe grapes:  11 And Pharaoh''s cup was in my hand: and I took the
    grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh''s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh''s
    hand. 12 And '
  '34': 'Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches
    are three days:  13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and
    restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh''s cup into his hand,
    after the former '
  '35': 'manner when thou wast his butler.  14 But think on me when it shall be well
    with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto
    Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 15 For indeed I was stolen away out of
    the land of the '
  '36': 'Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the
    dungeon.  16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said
    unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on
    my head: 17 And in '
  '37': 'the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and
    the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.  18 And Joseph answered
    and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:
    19 Yet within three '
  '38': 'days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on
    a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.  20 And it came to pass
    the third day, which was Pharaoh''s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his
    servants: and he '
  '39': 'lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.  21
    And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup
    into Pharaoh''s hand: 22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted
    to them. '
  '40': '23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. '
  '41': "\nChapter 41\n And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh\
    \ dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 2 And, behold, there came up out\
    \ of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.\
    \ 3 And, behold, seven "
  '42': 'other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed;
    and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.  4 And the ill favoured
    and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh
    awoke. 5 And he '
  '43': 'slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up
    upon one stalk, rank and good.  6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with
    the east wind sprung up after them. 7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven
    rank and full ears. '
  '44': 'And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.  8 And it came to pass in
    the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians
    of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there
    was none '
  '45': 'that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.  9 Then spake the chief butler unto
    Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 10 Pharaoh was wroth with his
    servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard''s house, both me and
    the chief baker: 11 '
  '46': 'And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according
    to the interpretation of his dream.  12 And there was there with us a young man,
    an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted
    to us our '
  '47': 'dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.  13 And it came
    to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office,
    and him he hanged. 14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
    hastily out of the '
  '48': 'dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto
    Pharaoh.  15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is
    none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand
    a dream to '
  '49': 'interpret it.  16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God
    shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my
    dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 18 And, behold, there came
    up out of the river '
  '50': 'seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:  19 And,
    behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed,
    such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:'

GenesisBook14:
  '1': ' 20 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat
    kine: 21 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had
    eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
    22 And I saw in my '
  '2': 'dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:  23 And,
    behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up
    after them: 24 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this
    unto the magicians; '
  '3': 'but there was none that could declare it to me.  25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh,
    The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. 26
    The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years:
    the dream is '
  '4': 'one.  27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them
    are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be
    seven years of famine. 28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh:
    What God is about to do '
  '5': 'he sheweth unto Pharaoh.  29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty
    throughout all the land of Egypt: 30 And there shall arise after them seven years
    of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the
    famine shall '
  '6': 'consume the land;  31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason
    of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous. 32 And for that the dream
    was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God,
    and God will '
  '7': 'shortly bring it to pass.  33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet
    and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let
    him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of
    Egypt in the seven '
  '8': 'plenteous years.  35 And let them gather all the food of those good years
    that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in
    the cities. 36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
    years of famine, which '
  '9': 'shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.  37
    And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
    38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man
    in whom the '
  '10': 'Spirit of God is?  39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath
    shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: 40 Thou
    shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled:
    only in the throne '
  '11': 'will I be greater than thou.  41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have
    set thee over all the land of Egypt. 42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his
    hand, and put it upon Joseph''s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen,
    and put a gold chain '
  '12': 'about his neck;  43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he
    had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the
    land of Egypt. 44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee
    shall no man lift up '
  '13': 'his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.  45 And Pharaoh called Joseph''s
    name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah
    priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. 46 And Joseph was
    thirty years old '
  '14': 'when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the
    presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.  47 And in the
    seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 48 And he gathered
    up all the food of the '
  '15': 'seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the
    cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in
    the same.  49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until
    he left numbering; for '
  '16': 'it was without number.  50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the
    years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare
    unto him. 51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said
    he, hath made me '
  '17': 'forget all my toil, and all my father''s house.  52 And the name of the second
    called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
    53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
    54 And '
  '18': 'the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and
    the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.  55
    And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread:
    and Pharaoh said '
  '19': 'unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.  56 And
    the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses,
    and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 57
    And all '
  '20': 'countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine
    was so sore in all lands. '
  '21': "\nChapter 42\n Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said\
    \ unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 2 And he said, Behold, I have\
    \ heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from\
    \ thence; that we may live, "
  '22': 'and not die.  3 And Joseph''s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
    4 But Benjamin, Joseph''s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said,
    Lest peradventure mischief befall him. 5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn
    among those that '
  '23': 'came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.  6 And Joseph was the governor
    over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph''s
    brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
    7 And '
  '24': 'Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto
    them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And
    they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.  8 And Joseph knew his brethren,
    but they knew not him. '
  '25': '9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto
    them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.  10 And they
    said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 11 We are
    all one man''s sons; we '
  '26': 'are true men, thy servants are no spies.  12 And he said unto them, Nay,
    but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 13 And they said, Thy servants
    are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the
    youngest is this day '
  '27': 'with our father, and one is not.  14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it
    that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: 15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By
    the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother
    come hither. 16 Send one '
  '28': 'of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that
    your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life
    of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.  17 And he put them all together into ward three
    days. 18 And '
  '29': 'Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:  19
    If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison:
    go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: 20 But bring your youngest brother
    unto me; so '
  '30': 'shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.  21
    And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in
    that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear;
    therefore is this '
  '31': 'distress come upon us.  22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not
    unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,
    behold, also his blood is required. 23 And they knew not that Joseph understood
    them; for he spake '
  '32': 'unto them by an interpreter.  24 And he turned himself about from them, and
    wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon,
    and bound him before their eyes. 25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks
    with corn, and '
  '33': 'to restore every man''s money into his sack, and to give them provision for
    the way: and thus did he unto them.  26 And they laded their asses with the corn,
    and departed thence. 27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender
    in the inn, '
  '34': 'he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack''s mouth.  28 And he
    said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack:
    and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What
    is this that God hath '
  '35': 'done unto us?  29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of
    Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 30 The man, who is the
    lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. 31
    And we said unto him, '
  '36': 'We are true men; we are no spies:  32 We be twelve brethren, sons of our
    father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of
    Canaan. 33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I
    know that ye are true '
  '37': 'men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine
    of your households, and be gone:  34 And bring your youngest brother unto me:
    then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver
    you your brother, '
  '38': 'and ye shall traffick in the land.  35 And it came to pass as they emptied
    their sacks, that, behold, every man''s bundle of money was in his sack: and when
    both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 36 And
    Jacob their father '
  '39': 'said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon
    is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.  37 And
    Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to
    thee: deliver him '
  '40': 'into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.  38 And he said, My son
    shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if
    mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my
    gray hairs with sorrow '
  '41': 'to the grave. '
  '42': "\nChapter 43\n And the famine was sore in the land. 2 And it came to pass,\
    \ when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father\
    \ said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. 3 And Judah spake unto him,\
    \ saying, The man did "
  '43': 'solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
    be with you.  4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
    thee food: 5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said
    unto us, Ye '
  '44': 'shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.  6 And Israel said,
    Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
    7 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying,
    Is your '
  '45': 'father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the
    tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother
    down?  8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will
    arise and go; '
  '46': 'that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.  9
    I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not
    unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: 10 For
    except we had '
  '47': 'lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.  11 And their father
    Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits
    in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm,
    and a little honey, '
  '48': 'spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:  12 And take double money in your hand;
    and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again
    in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 13 Take also your brother, and
    arise, go again '
  '49': 'unto the man:  14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he
    may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children,
    I am bereaved. 15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in
    their hand and '
  '50': Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.  16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.

  '1': ' 17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph''s
    house. 18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph''s house;
    and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first
    time are we '
  '2': 'brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take
    us for bondmen, and our asses.  19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph''s
    house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, 20 And said, O sir,
    we came indeed '
  '3': 'down at the first time to buy food:  21 And it came to pass, when we came
    to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man''s money was in the
    mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our
    hand. 22 And other '
  '4': 'money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put
    our money in our sacks.  23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God,
    and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your
    money. And he brought '
  '5': 'Simeon out unto them.  24 And the man brought the men into Joseph''s house,
    and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
    25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard
    that they should '
  '6': 'eat bread there.  26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present
    which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
    27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old
    man of whom ye '
  '7': 'spake? Is he yet alive?  28 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in
    good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.
    29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother''s son,
    and said, Is this '
  '8': 'your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious
    unto thee, my son.  30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
    brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept
    there. 31 And he '
  '9': 'washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.  32
    And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians,
    which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread
    with '
  '10': 'the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.  33 And they
    sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according
    to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. 34 And he took and sent messes
    unto them '
  '11': 'from before him: but Benjamin''s mess was five times so much as any of their''s.
    And they drank, and were merry with him. '
  '12': "\nChapter 44\n And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the\

    \ the youngest, and his corn "
  '13': 'money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.  3 As soon
    as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 4 And
    when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his
    steward, Up, follow '
  '14': 'after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore
    have ye rewarded evil for good?  5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and
    whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. 6 And he overtook them,
    and he spake unto '
  '15': 'them these same words.  7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord
    these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 8
    Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks'' mouths, we brought again unto
    thee out of the land of '

    With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will
    be my lord''s bondmen. 10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your
    words: he with whom it '
  '17': 'is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.  11 Then they speedily
    took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 12
    And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup
    was found in '
  '18': 'Benjamin''s sack.  13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his
    ass, and returned to the city. 14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph''s
    house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. 15 And Joseph
    said unto them, '
  '19': 'What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can
    certainly divine?  16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall
    we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of
    thy servants: behold, '
  '20': 'we are my lord''s servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.  17

    for thou art even as Pharaoh.  19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye
    a father, or a '

    a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is
    left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 21 And thou saidst unto thy servants,

    The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father
    would die. 23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother
    come down with you, ye '
  '24': 'shall see my face no more.  24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy
    servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 25 And our father said, Go
    again, and buy us a little food. 26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest
    brother be with '
  '25': 'us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man''s face, except our
    youngest brother be with us.  27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know
    that my wife bare me two sons: 28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely
    he is torn in '
  '26': 'pieces; and I saw him not since:  29 And if ye take this also from me, and
    mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
    30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with
    us; seeing that his '
  '27': 'life is bound up in the lad''s life;  31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth
    that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down
    the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 32 For thy
    servant became '
  '28': 'surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee,
    then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.  33 Now therefore, I pray thee,
    let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad

    So now it was not '

    children''s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 11
    And there will I '
  '36': 'nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy
    household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.  12 And, behold, your eyes
    see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto
    you. 13 And ye shall '
  '37': 'tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and
    ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.  14 And he fell upon his brother
    Benjamin''s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 15 Moreover he kissed
    all his brethren, '
  '38': 'and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.  16 And
    the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh''s house, saying, Joseph''s brethren are
    come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. 17 And Pharaoh said unto
    Joseph, Say unto thy '
  '39': 'brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of
    Canaan;  18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I
    will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
    19 Now thou art '
  '40': 'commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your
    little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.  20 Also regard
    not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your''s. 21 And the children
    of Israel did '
  '41': 'so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh,
    and gave them provision for the way.  22 To all of them he gave each man changes
    of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes
    of raiment. 23 '
  '42': 'And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good
    things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his
    father by the way.  24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he
    said unto them, See '
  '43': 'that ye fall not out by the way.  25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came
    into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, 26 And told him, saying, Joseph

    Pharaoh, For to '
  '15': 'sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their
    flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee,

    saying, Thy '

    an hundred and '

    have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the

    Pharaoh. 11 And '
  '19': 'Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in
    the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh
    had commanded.  12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all
    his father''s household, '
  '20': 'with bread, according to their families.  13 And there was no bread in all
    the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the
    land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. 14 And Joseph gathered up all
    the money that was found '
  '21': 'in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they
    bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh''s house.  15 And when money
    failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came
    unto Joseph, and said, '
  '22': 'Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.  16
    And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money
    fail. 17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread
    in exchange '
  '23': 'for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for
    the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.  18
    When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him,

  '24': 'from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of
    cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our

    us and our land for '
  '25': 'bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed,
    that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.  20 And Joseph bought
    all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field,
    because the '
  '26': 'famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh''s.  21 And as for
    the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even
    to the other end thereof. 22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the
    priests had a portion '
  '27': 'assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them:
    wherefore they sold not their lands.  23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold,
    I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you,
    and ye shall '
  '28': 'sow the land.  24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall
    give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of
    the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for
    your little ones. 25 '
  '29': 'And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight
    of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh''s servants.  26 And Joseph made it a law over
    the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except
    the land of the '
  '30': 'priests only, which became not Pharaoh''s.  27 And Israel dwelt in the land
    of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew,
    and multiplied exceedingly. 28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen
    years: so the whole '
  '31': 'age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.  29 And the time drew
    nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If
    now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh,
    and deal kindly and '
  '32': 'truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:  30 But I will lie with
    my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace.
    And he said, I will do as thou hast said. 31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he
    sware unto him. '
  '33': 'And Israel bowed himself upon the bed''s head. '
  '34': "\nChapter 48\n And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,\
    \ Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and\
    \ Ephraim. 2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto\
    \ thee: and Israel "
  '35': 'strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.  3 And Jacob said unto Joseph,
    God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 4
    And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I
    will make of thee a '
  '36': 'multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an
    everlasting possession.  5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were
    born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine;
    as Reuben and '
  '37': 'Simeon, they shall be mine.  6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after
    them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in
    their inheritance. 7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me
    in the land of Canaan in '
  '38': 'the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I
    buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.  8 And Israel beheld
    Joseph''s sons, and said, Who are these? 9 And Joseph said unto his father, They
    are my sons, whom '
  '39': 'God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto
    me, and I will bless them.  10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that
    he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced
    them. 11 And '
  '40': 'Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God
    hath shewed me also thy seed.  12 And Joseph brought them out from between his
    knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 13 And Joseph took them
    both, Ephraim in his '
  '41': 'right hand toward Israel''s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward
    Israel''s right hand, and brought them near unto him.  14 And Israel stretched
    out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim''s head, who was the younger, and
    his left hand upon '
  '42': 'Manasseh''s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.  15
    And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac
    did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, 16 The Angel which
    redeemed me '
  '43': 'from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the
    name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the
    midst of the earth.  17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand
    upon the head of '
  '44': 'Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father''s hand, to remove
    it from Ephraim''s head unto Manasseh''s head.  18 And Joseph said unto his father,
    Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
    19 And his father '

    he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.  20 And he blessed them
    that day, saying, '
  '46': 'In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh:
    and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.  21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I
    die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
    22 Moreover I '

    did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
    18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have
    ye done this thing, '
  '9': 'and have saved the men children alive?  19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh,
    Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and
    are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. 20 Therefore God dealt well
    with the '
  '10': 'midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.  21 And it came
    to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. 22 And Pharaoh
    charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the
    river, and every '
  '11': 'daughter ye shall save alive. '
  '12': "\nChapter 2\n And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife\
    \ a daughter of Levi. 2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she\
    \ saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 3 And when she\
    \ could not longer hide him, she "
  '13': 'took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch,
    and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river''s brink.  4
    And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. 5 And the daughter
    of Pharaoh came '
  '14': 'down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river''s
    side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.  6
    And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And
    she had '
  '15': 'compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews'' children.  7 Then
    said his sister to Pharaoh''s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of
    the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 8 And Pharaoh''s daughter
    said to her, Go. And '
  '16': 'the maid went and called the child''s mother.  9 And Pharaoh''s daughter
    said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee
    thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it. 10 And the child grew,
    and she brought him unto '
  '17': 'Pharaoh''s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses:
    and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.  11 And it came to pass in
    those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked
    on their burdens: and '
  '18': 'he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.  12 And he looked
    this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian,
    and hid him in the sand. 13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men
    of the '
  '19': 'Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore
    smitest thou thy fellow?  14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over
    us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared,
    and said, Surely '
  '20': 'this thing is known.  15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to
    slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of
    Midian: and he sat down by a well. 16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters:
    and they came and '
  '21': 'drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father''s flock.  17 And
    the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and
    watered their flock. 18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How
    is it that ye are come '
  '22': 'so soon to day?  19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand
    of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. 20
    And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the
    man? call him, that '
  '23': 'he may eat bread.  21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he
    gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 22 And she bare him a son, and he called his
    name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. 23 And it
    came to pass in process '
  '24': 'of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by
    reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason
    of the bondage.  24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
    with Abraham, with '
  '25': Isaac, and with Jacob.  25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.
  '26': "\nChapter 3\n Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest\
    \ of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the\
    \ mountain of God, even to Horeb. 2 And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him\
    \ in a flame of fire "
  '27': 'out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with
    fire, and the bush was not consumed.  3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside,
    and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 4 And when the Lord saw that
    he turned aside '
  '28': 'to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses,
    Moses. And he said, Here am I.  5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy
    shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 6
    Moreover he said, I '
  '29': 'am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
    of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.  7 And the
    Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt,
    and have heard their '
  '30': 'cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;  8 And I am
    come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them
    up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk
    and honey; unto the '
  '31': 'place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites,
    and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.  9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children
    of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians '
  '32': 'oppress them.  10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh,
    that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. 11
    And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should
    bring forth the '
  '33': 'children of Israel out of Egypt?  12 And he said, Certainly I will be with
    thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast
    brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
    13 And Moses said '
  '34': 'unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say
    unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to
    me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?  14 And God said unto Moses,
    I Am That I Am: and he '
  '35': 'said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me
    unto you.  15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children
    of Israel, the Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
    and the God of '
  '36': 'Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial
    unto all generations.  16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say
    unto them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
    Jacob, appeared '
  '37': 'unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to
    you in Egypt:  17 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of
    Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and
    the Perizzites, and '
  '38': 'the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.  18
    And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders
    of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The Lord God of
    the Hebrews hath met '
  '39': 'with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days'' journey into the
    wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.  19 And I am sure that
    the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. 20 And I will
    stretch out my hand, and '
  '40': 'smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and
    after that he will let you go.  21 And I will give this people favour in the sight
    of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go
    empty. 22 But every '
  '41': 'woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house,
    jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon
    your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians. '
  '42': "\nChapter 4\n And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe\
    \ me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared\
    \ unto thee. 2 And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he\
    \ said, A rod. 3 And he "
  '43': 'said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became
    a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.  4 And the Lord said unto Moses, Put
    forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught
    it, and it became a '
  '44': 'rod in his hand:  5 That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers,
    the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto
    thee. 6 And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom.
    And he put his '
  '45': 'hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous
    as snow.  7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand
    into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned
    again as his '
  '46': 'other flesh.  8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee,
    neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice
    of the latter sign. 9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also
    these two signs, '
  '47': 'neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the
    river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the
    river shall become blood upon the dry land.  10 And Moses said unto the Lord,
    O my Lord, I am not '
  '48': 'eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant:
    but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.  11 And the Lord said unto him,
    Who hath made man''s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or
    the blind? have not I '
  '49': 'the Lord?  12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee
    what thou shalt say. 13 And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand
    of him whom thou wilt send. 14 And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses,
    and he said, Is '
  '50': 'not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also,
    behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad
    in his heart. '

  '1': ' 15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will
    be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. 16
    And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall
    be to thee instead of a '
  '2': 'mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.  17 And thou shalt take this
    rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs. 18 And Moses went and returned
    to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return
    unto my '
  '3': 'brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro
    said to Moses, Go in peace.  19 And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return
    into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life. 20 And Moses took
    his wife and his '
  '4': 'sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and
    Moses took the rod of God in his hand.  21 And the Lord said unto Moses, When
    thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh,
    which I have put in '
  '5': 'thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people
    go.  22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son,
    even my firstborn: 23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me:
    and if thou refuse to '
  '6': 'let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.  24 And it came
    to pass by the way in the inn, that the Lord met him, and sought to kill him.
    25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and
    cast it at his feet, '
  '7': 'and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.  26 So he let him go: then
    she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision. 27 And the Lord
    said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him
    in the mount of '
  '8': 'God, and kissed him.  28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who
    had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. 29 And Moses and Aaron
    went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: 30 And Aaron
    spake all the '
  '9': 'words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight
    of the people.  31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord
    had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction,
    then they bowed '
  '10': 'their heads and worshipped. '
  '11': "\nChapter 5\n And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus\
    \ saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto\
    \ me in the wilderness. 2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I should obey\
    \ his voice to let Israel "
  '12': 'go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.  3 And they said,
    The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days''
    journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God; lest he fall upon
    us with pestilence, or '
  '13': 'with the sword.  4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye,
    Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. 5
    And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them
    rest from their '
  '14': 'burdens.  6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,
    and their officers, saying, 7 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick,
    as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 8 And the tale of
    the bricks, '
  '15': 'which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish
    ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice
    to our God.  9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
    therein; and '
  '16': 'let them not regard vain words.  10 And the taskmasters of the people went
    out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh,
    I will not give you straw. 11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not
    ought of your '
  '17': 'work shall be diminished.  12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout
    all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. 13 And the taskmasters
    hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.
    14 And the '
  '18': 'officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh''s taskmasters had set
    over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task
    in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?  15 Then the officers
    of the children of '
  '19': 'Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with
    thy servants?  16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us,
    Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own
    people. 17 But he '
  '20': 'said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice
    to the Lord.  18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given
    you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 19 And the officers of the children
    of Israel did see '
  '21': 'that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought
    from your bricks of your daily task.  20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood
    in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 21 And they said unto them, The Lord
    look upon you, and '
  '22': 'judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh,
    and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.  22
    And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil
    entreated this '
  '23': people? why is it that thou hast sent me?  23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
  '24': "\nChapter 6\n Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will\
    \ do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong\
    \ hand shall he drive them out of his land. 2 And God spake unto Moses, and said\
    \ unto him, I am the Lord: "
  '25': '3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of
    God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.  4 And I have also
    established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of
    their pilgrimage, '
  '26': 'wherein they were strangers.  5 And I have also heard the groaning of the
    children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered
    my covenant. 6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I
    will bring you out from '
  '27': 'under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage,
    and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:  7 And
    I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know
    that I am the '
  '28': 'Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.  8
    And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give
    it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage:
    I am the Lord. '
  '29': '9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not
    unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.  10 And the Lord spake
    unto Moses, saying, 11 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the
    children of Israel go '
  '30': 'out of his land.  12 And Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the
    children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me,
    who am of uncircumcised lips? 13 And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,
    and gave them a charge '
  '31': 'unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the
    children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.  14 These be the heads of their fathers''

    and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these
    are the families of Simeon. 16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according
    to their '
  '33': 'generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of
    Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.  17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and
    Shimi, according to their families. 18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar,
    and Hebron, and '
  '34': 'Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three
    years.  19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of
    Levi according to their generations. 20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father''s
    sister to wife; '
  '35': 'and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were
    an hundred and thirty and seven years.  21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg,
    and Zichri. 22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. 23 And
    Aaron took him '

    Aaron''s son took him '
  '37': 'one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these
    are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.  26 These
    are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the Lord said, Bring out the children of Israel
    from the land of '
  '38': 'Egypt according to their armies.  27 These are they which spake to Pharaoh
    king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that
    Moses and Aaron. 28 And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses
    in the land of Egypt,'
  '39': ' 29 That the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord: speak thou unto
    Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. 30 And Moses said before the Lord,
    Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?'
  '40': "\nChapter 7\n And the Lord said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to\

    \ send the children of Israel "
  '41': 'out of his land.  3 And I will harden Pharaoh''s heart, and multiply my signs
    and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you,
    that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people
    the children of '
  '42': 'Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.  5 And the Egyptians
    shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and
    bring out the children of Israel from among them. 6 And Moses and Aaron did as
    the Lord commanded them, '
  '43': 'so did they.  7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and
    three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. 8 And the Lord spake unto Moses
    and unto Aaron, saying, 9 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle
    for you: then '
  '44': 'thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and
    it shall become a serpent.  10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they
    did so as the Lord had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh,
    and before his '
  '45': 'servants, and it became a serpent.  11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise
    men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner
    with their enchantments. 12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became
    serpents: but '
  '46': 'Aaron''s rod swallowed up their rods.  13 And he hardened Pharaoh''s heart,
    that he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said. 14 And the Lord said unto
    Moses, Pharaoh''s heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. 15 Get
    thee unto Pharaoh in '
  '47': 'the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the
    river''s brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt
    thou take in thine hand.  16 And thou shalt say unto him, The Lord God of the
    Hebrews hath sent me '

    and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.  17 Thus saith the Lord, In this
    thou shalt know that I am the Lord: behold, I will smite with the rod that is
    in mine hand upon '
  '49': 'the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.  18
    And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the
    Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. 19 And the Lord spake
    unto Moses, Say unto '
  '50': 'Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt,
    upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their
    pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout

    and all the '
  '2': 'waters that were in the river were turned to blood.  21 And the fish that
    was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink
    of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
    22 And the magicians '
  '3': 'of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh''s heart was hardened,
    neither did he hearken unto them; as the Lord had said.  23 And Pharaoh turned
    and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. 24 And all
    the Egyptians digged '
  '4': round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.  25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the Lord had smitten the river.
  '5': "\nChapter 8\n And the Lord spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto\
    \ him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 2 And if\
    \ thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:\
    \ 3 And the river shall bring "
  '6': 'forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into
    thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon
    thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:  4 And the frogs
    shall come up '
  '7': 'both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.  5 And the Lord
    spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the
    streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon
    the land of Egypt. '
  '8': '6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs
    came up, and covered the land of Egypt.  7 And the magicians did so with their
    enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. 8 Then Pharaoh called
    for Moses and Aaron, '
  '9': 'and said, Intreat the Lord, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from
    my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the Lord.  9
    And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and
    for thy '
  '10': 'servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses,
    that they may remain in the river only?  10 And he said, To morrow. And he said,
    Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto
    the Lord our God. '
  '11': '11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy
    servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.  12 And Moses
    and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the Lord because of the
    frogs which he had '
  '12': 'brought against Pharaoh.  13 And the Lord did according to the word of Moses;
    and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.
    14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank. 15 But when
    Pharaoh saw that '
  '13': 'there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as
    the Lord had said.  16 And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out
    thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all
    the land of Egypt. '
  '14': '17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote
    the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of
    the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.  18 And the magicians did
    so with their '
  '15': 'enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice
    upon man, and upon beast.  19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the
    finger of God: and Pharaoh''s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them;
    as the Lord had said. '
  '16': '20 And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand
    before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith
    the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me.  21 Else, if thou wilt not
    let my people go, '
  '17': 'behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and
    upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be
    full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.  22 And I will
    sever in that day the '
  '18': 'land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be
    there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.  23
    And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this
    sign be. 24 '
  '19': 'And the Lord did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house
    of Pharaoh, and into his servants'' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the
    land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.  25 And Pharaoh called for
    Moses and for Aaron, '
  '20': 'and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.  26 And Moses said, It
    is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians
    to the Lord our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before
    their eyes, and '
  '21': 'will they not stone us?  27 We will go three days'' journey into the wilderness,
    and sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he shall command us. 28 And Pharaoh said,
    I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness;
    only ye shall '
  '22': 'not go very far away: intreat for me.  29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out
    from thee, and I will intreat the Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from
    Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh
    deal deceitfully any '
  '23': 'more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.  30 And Moses
    went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord. 31 And the Lord did according to
    the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants,
    and from his '
  '24': people; there remained not one.  32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.
  '25': "\nChapter 9\n Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell\
    \ him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may\
    \ serve me. 2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 3 Behold,\
    \ the hand of the Lord is "
  '26': 'upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon
    the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous
    murrain.  4 And the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle
    of Egypt: and there '
  '27': 'shall nothing die of all that is the children''s of Israel.  5 And the Lord
    appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land.
    6 And the Lord did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died:
    but of the cattle '
  '28': 'of the children of Israel died not one.  7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold,
    there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh
    was hardened, and he did not let the people go. 8 And the Lord said unto Moses
    and unto Aaron, Take '
  '29': 'to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward
    the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.  9 And it shall become small dust in all the
    land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon
    beast, throughout '
  '30': 'all the land of Egypt.  10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood
    before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil
    breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. 11 And the magicians could
    not stand before Moses '
  '31': 'because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the
    Egyptians.  12 And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not
    unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses. 13 And the Lord said unto Moses,
    Rise up early in the '
  '32': 'morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord
    God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.  14 For I will at
    this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon
    thy people; that thou '
  '33': 'mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.  15 For now I will
    stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and
    thou shalt be cut off from the earth. 16 And in very deed for this cause have
    I raised thee up, for '
  '34': 'to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all
    the earth.  17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt
    not let them go? 18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain
    a very grievous hail, '
  '35': 'such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.  19
    Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field;
    for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not
    be brought home, '
  '36': 'the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.  20 He that feared
    the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle
    flee into the houses: 21 And he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his
    servants and his '
  '37': 'cattle in the field.  22 And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine
    hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man,
    and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
    23 And Moses '
  '38': 'stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the Lord sent thunder and hail,
    and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the Lord rained hail upon the land
    of Egypt.  24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
    such as there was '
  '39': 'none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.  25 And the
    hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man
    and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of
    the field. 26 Only '
  '40': 'in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.  27
    And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned
    this time: the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 28 Intreat the
    Lord (for '
  '41': 'it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will
    let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.  29 And Moses said unto him, As soon
    as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord; and
    the thunder shall '
  '42': 'cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that
    the earth is the Lord''s.  30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye
    will not yet fear the Lord God. 31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for
    the barley was in the '
  '43': 'ear, and the flax was bolled.  32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten:
    for they were not grown up. 33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and
    spread abroad his hands unto the Lord: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the
    rain was not '
  '44': 'poured upon the earth.  34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail
    and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and
    his servants. 35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the
    children of Israel '
  '45': 'go; as the Lord had spoken by Moses. '
  '46': "\nChapter 10\n And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have\
    \ hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my\
    \ signs before him: 2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of\
    \ thy son's son, what things "
  '47': 'I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that
    ye may know how that I am the Lord.  3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh,
    and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou
    refuse to humble '
  '48': 'thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.  4 Else, if
    thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into
    thy coast: 5 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able
    to see the earth: '
  '49': 'and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth
    unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of
    the field:  6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants,
    and the houses of all '
  '50': 'the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers'' fathers have
    seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned
    himself, and went out from Pharaoh. '

  '1': ' 7 And Pharaoh''s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare
    unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God: knowest thou
    not yet that Egypt is destroyed? 8 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto
    Pharaoh: and he said '
  '2': 'unto them, Go, serve the Lord your God: but who are they that shall go?  9
    And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and
    with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must
    hold a feast unto the '
  '3': 'Lord.  10 And he said unto them, Let the Lord be so with you, as I will let
    you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. 11 Not so: go
    now ye that are men, and serve the Lord; for that ye did desire. And they were
    driven out from '
  '4': 'Pharaoh''s presence.  12 And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand
    over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of
    Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. 13 And
    Moses stretched '
  '5': 'forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind upon
    the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind
    brought the locusts.  14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and
    rested in all '
  '6': 'the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such
    locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.  15 For they covered the face
    of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb
    of the land, and '
  '7': 'all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not
    any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land
    of Egypt.  16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I
    have sinned against '
  '8': 'the Lord your God, and against you.  17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee,
    my sin only this once, and intreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from
    me this death only. 18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord. 19
    And the Lord '
  '9': 'turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them
    into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.  20
    But the Lord hardened Pharaoh''s heart, so that he would not let the children
    of Israel go. 21 And '
  '10': 'the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there
    may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.  22 And
    Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in
    all the land of '
  '11': 'Egypt three days:  23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his
    place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
    24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the Lord; only let your
    flocks and your '
  '12': 'herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.  25 And Moses said,
    Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto
    the Lord our God. 26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof
    be left behind; '
  '13': 'for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we know not with
    what we must serve the Lord, until we come thither.  27 But the Lord hardened
    Pharaoh''s heart, and he would not let them go. 28 And Pharaoh said unto him,
    Get thee from me, take heed '
  '14': to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.  29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.
  '15': "\nChapter 11\n And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague\
    \ more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when\
    \ he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. 2 Speak\
    \ now in the ears of the "
  '16': 'people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her
    neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold.  3 And the Lord gave the people
    favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in
    the land of Egypt, in '
  '17': 'the sight of Pharaoh''s servants, and in the sight of the people.  4 And
    Moses said, Thus saith the Lord, About midnight will I go out into the midst of
    Egypt: 5 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first
    born of Pharaoh that '
  '18': sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.  6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.
  '19': ' 7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue,
    against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference
    between the Egyptians and Israel. 8 And all these thy servants shall come down
    unto me, and bow '
  '20': 'down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow
    thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.  9
    And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders
    may be '
  '21': 'multiplied in the land of Egypt.  10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders
    before Pharaoh: and the Lord hardened Pharaoh''s heart, so that he would not let
    the children of Israel go out of his land.'
  '22': "\nChapter 12\n And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt\

    \ Israel, saying, In the tenth "
  '23': 'day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to
    the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:  4 And if the household be too
    little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according
    to the number of '
  '24': 'the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the
    lamb.  5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall
    take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 6 And ye shall keep it up until
    the fourteenth day of '
  '25': 'the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall
    kill it in the evening.  7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on
    the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall
    eat it. 8 And they '
  '26': 'shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread;
    and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.  9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all
    with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance
    thereof. 10 And ye '
  '27': 'shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth
    of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.  11 And thus shall ye eat it;
    with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand;
    and ye shall eat it in '
  '28': 'haste: it is the Lord''s passover.  12 For I will pass through the land of
    Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both
    man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am
    the Lord. 13 And the '
  '29': 'blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when
    I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to
    destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.  14 And this day shall be unto you
    for a memorial; and ye '
  '30': 'shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep
    it a feast by an ordinance for ever.  15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread;
    even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever
    eateth leavened '
  '31': 'bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off
    from Israel.  16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and
    in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work
    shall be done in them, '
  '32': 'save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.  17 And
    ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have
    I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this
    day in your generations '
  '33': 'by an ordinance for ever.  18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of
    the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth
    day of the month at even. 19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your
    houses: for whosoever '
  '34': 'eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation
    of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.  20 Ye shall eat nothing
    leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. 21 Then Moses
    called '
  '35': 'for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a
    lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.  22 And ye shall take
    a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the
    lintel and the two side '
  '36': 'posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at
    the door of his house until the morning.  23 For the Lord will pass through to
    smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two
    side posts, the Lord '
  '37': 'will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto
    your houses to smite you.  24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance
    to thee and to thy sons for ever. 25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come
    to the land which the '
  '38': 'Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this
    service.  26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you,
    What mean ye by this service? 27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the
    Lord''s passover, who '
  '39': 'passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote
    the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.  28
    And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses
    and Aaron, so '
  '40': 'did they.  29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the
    firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his
    throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the
    firstborn of cattle. 30 '
  '41': 'And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians;
    and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was
    not one dead.  31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
    and get you '
  '42': 'forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve
    the Lord, as ye have said.  32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have
    said, and be gone; and bless me also. 33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the
    people, that they '
  '43': 'might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.  34
    And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs
    being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 35 And the children of Israel
    did '
  '44': 'according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels
    of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:  36 And the Lord gave the people favour
    in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they
    required. And they '
  '45': 'spoiled the Egyptians.  37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses
    to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.
    38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very
    much cattle. 39 '
  '46': 'And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out
    of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and
    could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.  40 Now
    the sojourning of the '
  '47': 'children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.  41
    And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the
    selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the
    land of Egypt. 42 '

    that the Lord did '

    \ this day, in which ye came "

    thee into the '

    days thou shalt eat '

    Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread

    Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year. 11 And
    it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as
    he sware unto thee '

    unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of
    a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the Lord''s. 13 And every firstling
    of an ass thou shalt '
  '11': 'redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break

    that thou shalt say '
  '12': 'unto him, By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the
    house of bondage:  15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go,
    that the Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn
    of man, and the '
  '13': 'firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the
    matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.  16 And it
    shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for
    by strength of hand '

    had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the
    Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people
    repent when they '
  '15': 'see war, and they return to Egypt:  18 But God led the people about, through
    the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed
    out of the land of Egypt. 19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for
    he had '
  '16': 'straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you;
    and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.  20 And they took their journey
    from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 21 And the
    Lord went before '
  '17': 'them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in
    a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:  22 He took not
    away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before
    the people.'
  '18': "\nChapter 14\n And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Speak unto the children\

    \ sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. 3 For Pharaoh\
    \ will say of the "
  '19': 'children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut
    them in.  4 And I will harden Pharaoh''s heart, that he shall follow after them;
    and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians
    may know that I am '
  '20': 'the Lord. And they did so.  5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the
    people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the
    people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from
    serving us? 6 And he '
  '21': 'made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:  7 And he took six
    hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every
    one of them. 8 And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he
    pursued after the '
  '22': 'children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.  9
    But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh,
    and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside
    Pihahiroth, before '
  '23': 'Baalzephon.  10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted
    up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore
    afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord. 11 And they said unto
    Moses, Because '
  '24': 'there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?
    wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  12 Is
    not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we
    may serve the '
  '25': 'Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that
    we should die in the wilderness.  13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not,
    stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you to day:
    for the '
  '26': 'Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.  14
    The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. 15 And the Lord said
    unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel,
    that they go '
  '27': 'forward:  16 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the
    sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through
    the midst of the sea. 17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians,
    and they shall '
  '28': 'follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host,
    upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.  18 And the Egyptians shall know that
    I am the Lord, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and
    upon his horsemen. '
  '29': '19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and
    went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and
    stood behind them:  20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp
    of Israel; and it '
  '30': 'was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so
    that the one came not near the other all the night.  21 And Moses stretched out
    his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east
    wind all that night, '
  '31': 'and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.  22 And the children
    of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were
    a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 23 And the Egyptians
    pursued, and went '
  '32': 'in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh''s horses, his chariots,
    and his horsemen.  24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord
    looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud,
    and troubled '
  '33': 'the host of the Egyptians,  25 And took off their chariot wheels, that they
    drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel;
    for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians. 26 And the Lord said unto
    Moses, Stretch '
  '34': 'out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians,
    upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.  27 And Moses stretched forth his
    hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared;
    and the '
  '35': 'Egyptians fled against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst
    of the sea.  28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen,
    and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained
    not so much as '
  '36': 'one of them.  29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst
    of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their
    left. 30 Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians;
    and Israel saw '
  '37': 'the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.  31 And Israel saw that great work
    which the Lord did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord, and believed
    the Lord, and his servant Moses.'
  '38': "\nChapter 15\n Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto\
    \ the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed\
    \ gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 2 The Lord\
    \ is my strength and song, and "
  '39': 'he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation;
    my father''s God, and I will exalt him.  3 The Lord is a man of war: the Lord
    is his name. 4 Pharaoh''s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
    chosen captains also '
  '40': 'are drowned in the Red sea.  5 The depths have covered them: they sank into
    the bottom as a stone. 6 Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power:
    thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. 7 And in the greatness
    of thine excellency '
  '41': 'thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy
    wrath, which consumed them as stubble.  8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the
    waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths
    were congealed '
  '42': 'in the heart of the sea.  9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake,
    I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my
    sword, my hand shall destroy them. 10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered
    them: they sank '
  '43': 'as lead in the mighty waters.  11 Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the
    gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
    12 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. 13 Thou in thy
    mercy hast led '
  '44': 'forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength
    unto thy holy habitation.  14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall
    take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. 15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be
    amazed; the '
  '45': 'mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants
    of Canaan shall melt away.  16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness
    of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord,
    till the '
  '46': 'people pass over, which thou hast purchased.  17 Thou shalt bring them in,
    and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which
    thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands
    have established. 18 '
  '47': 'The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.  19 For the horse of Pharaoh went
    in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought
    again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry
    land in the midst of the '
  '48': 'sea.  20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in
    her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
    21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously;
    the horse and his '
  '49': 'rider hath he thrown into the sea.  22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red
    sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in
    the wilderness, and found no water. 23 And when they came to Marah, they could
    not drink of the '
  '50': 'waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called
    Marah.  24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?'

    sat by the flesh '

    into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.  4 Then said the
    Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people
    shall go out and '
  '7': 'gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will
    walk in my law, or no.  5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they

    against the '

    shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the
    morning bread to the full; for that the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye
    murmur against him: and '
  '10': 'what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.  9
    And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel,
    Come near before the Lord: for he hath heard your murmurings. 10 And it came to
    pass, as Aaron '
  '11': 'spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked
    toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.  11
    And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 12 I have heard the murmurings of the children
    of '
  '12': 'Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning
    ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.  13
    And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and
    in the '
  '13': 'morning the dew lay round about the host.  14 And when the dew that lay was
    gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing,
    as small as the hoar frost on the ground. 15 And when the children of Israel saw
    it, they said one '
  '14': 'to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto
    them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.  16 This is the
    thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating,
    an omer for '
  '15': 'every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for
    them which are in his tents.  17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered,
    some more, some less. 18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered
    much had nothing '
  '16': 'over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according
    to his eating.  19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 20
    Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until
    the morning, '
  '17': 'and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.  21 And they
    gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun
    waxed hot, it melted. 22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered
    twice as much bread, '
  '18': 'two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told
    Moses.  23 And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To morrow
    is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord: bake that which ye will bake to
    day, and seethe '
  '19': 'that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept
    until the morning.  24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and
    it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. 25 And Moses said, Eat that
    to day; for to '
  '20': 'day is a sabbath unto the Lord: to day ye shall not find it in the field.  26
    Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in
    it there shall be none. 27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the
    people on the '
  '21': 'seventh day for to gather, and they found none.  28 And the Lord said unto
    Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? 29 See, for that
    the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day
    the bread of two days; '
  '22': 'abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh
    day.  30 So the people rested on the seventh day. 31 And the house of Israel called
    the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of
    it was like '
  '23': 'wafers made with honey.  32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord
    commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may
    see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth
    from the land of '
  '24': 'Egypt.  33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
    manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations.
    34 As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be
    kept. 35 And the '
  '25': children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.  36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
  '26': "\nChapter 17\n And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed\
    \ from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment\
    \ of the Lord, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people\
    \ to drink. 2 Wherefore the "
  '27': 'people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And
    Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?  3
    And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses,
    and said, Wherefore '
  '28': 'is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children
    and our cattle with thirst?  4 And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall
    I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. 5 And the Lord said unto
    Moses, Go on '
  '29': 'before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod,
    wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.  6 Behold, I will
    stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock,
    and there shall come '
  '30': 'water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight
    of the elders of Israel.  7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah,
    because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the
    Lord, saying, Is '
  '31': 'the Lord among us, or not?  8 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in
    Rephidim. 9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with
    Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine
    hand. 10 So '
  '32': 'Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron,
    and Hur went up to the top of the hill.  11 And it came to pass, when Moses held
    up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
    12 But '
  '33': 'Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and
    he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side,

    of the sun.  13 And '
  '34': 'Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.  14
    And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse
    it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek
    from under heaven. 15 '
  '35': 'And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:  16 For

    \ Zipporah, Moses' wife, "
  '37': 'after he had sent her back,  3 And her two sons; of which the name of the
    one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 4 And the
    name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help,
    and delivered me '
  '38': 'from the sword of Pharaoh:  5 And Jethro, Moses'' father in law, came with
    his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the
    mount of God: 6 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto
    thee, and thy wife, '
  '39': 'and her two sons with her.  7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law,
    and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare;
    and they came into the tent. 8 And Moses told his father in law all that the Lord
    had done unto '
  '40': 'Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel''s sake, and all the travail that
    had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord delivered them.  9 And Jethro
    rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel, whom he had delivered
    out of the hand '
  '41': 'of the Egyptians.  10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath delivered
    you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath
    delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 11 Now I know that
    the Lord is greater '

    and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. 14 And when Moses''
    father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that
    thou '
  '44': 'doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand
    by thee from morning unto even?  15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because
    the people come unto me to enquire of God: 16 When they have a matter, they come
    unto me; and '
  '45': 'I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of
    God, and his laws.  17 And Moses'' father in law said unto him, The thing that
    thou doest is not good. 18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people
    that is with thee: for '
  '46': 'this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself
    alone.  19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall
    be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes
    unto God: 20 And '
  '47': 'thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein
    they must walk, and the work that they must do.  21 Moreover thou shalt provide
    out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness;
    and place '
  '48': 'such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers
    of fifties, and rulers of tens:  22 And let them judge the people at all seasons:
    and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every
    small matter they '
  '49': 'shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden
    with thee.  23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou
    shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
    24 So Moses '
  '50': hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.  25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

  '1': ' 26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought

    father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.'
  '2': "\nChapter 19\n In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth\
    \ out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.\
    \ 2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai,\
    \ and had pitched in "
  '3': 'the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.  3 And Moses went
    up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt
    thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; 4 Ye have seen
    what I did unto '
  '4': 'the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles'' wings, and brought you unto
    myself.  5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant,
    then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth
    is mine: 6 And ye '
  '5': 'shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words
    which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.  7 And Moses came and called
    for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which
    the Lord '
  '6': 'commanded him.  8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that
    the Lord hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto
    the Lord. 9 And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud,
    that the people '
  '7': 'may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told
    the words of the people unto the Lord.  10 And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto
    the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,
    11 And be '
  '8': 'ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will come down in
    the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.  12 And thou shalt set bounds unto
    the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into
    the mount, or touch '
  '9': 'the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:  13
    There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through;
    whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long,
    they shall '
  '10': 'come up to the mount.  14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people,
    and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 15 And he said unto
    the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives. 16 And it
    came to pass on the '
  '11': 'third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a
    thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that
    all the people that was in the camp trembled.  17 And Moses brought forth the
    people out of the camp '
  '12': 'to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.  18 And
    mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire:
    and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount
    quaked greatly. 19 '
  '13': 'And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder,
    Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.  20 And the Lord came down upon
    mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the Lord called Moses up to the top
    of the mount; and '
  '14': 'Moses went up.  21 And the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people,
    lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish. 22 And
    let the priests also, which come near to the Lord, sanctify themselves, lest the
    Lord break forth '
  '15': 'upon them.  23 And Moses said unto the Lord, The people cannot come up to
    mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify
    it. 24 And the Lord said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up,
    thou, and Aaron '
  '16': 'with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up
    unto the Lord, lest he break forth upon them.  25 So Moses went down unto the
    people, and spake unto them.'
  '17': "\nChapter 20\n And God spake all these words, saying, 2 I am the Lord thy\
    \ God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\
    \ 3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any\
    \ graven image, or any "
  '18': 'likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,
    or that is in the water under the earth.  5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to
    them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity
    of the '
  '19': 'fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
    hate me;  6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
    commandments. 7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for
    the Lord will not hold '
  '20': 'him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  8 Remember the sabbath day,
    to keep it holy. 9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 10 But the
    seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work,
    thou, nor thy son, '
  '21': 'nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor
    thy stranger that is within thy gates:  11 For in six days the Lord made heaven
    and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
    the Lord blessed '
  '22': 'the sabbath day, and hallowed it.  12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that
    thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 13 Thou
    shalt not kill. 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. 15 Thou shalt not steal. 16
    Thou shalt not bear '
  '23': 'false witness against thy neighbour.  17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour''s
    house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour''s wife, nor his manservant, nor his
    maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour''s.
    18 And all the people '
  '24': 'saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and
    the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar
    off.  19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let
    not God speak with '
  '25': 'us, lest we die.  20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is
    come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
    21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness
    where God was. 22 And '
  '26': 'the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel,
    Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.  23 Ye shall not make with
    me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. 24 An altar of
    earth thou shalt '
  '27': 'make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace
    offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will
    come unto thee, and I will bless thee.  25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of
    stone, thou '
  '28': 'shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou
    hast polluted it.  26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that
    thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.'
  '29': "\nChapter 21\n Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.\
    \ 2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh\
    \ he shall go out free for nothing. 3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out\
    \ by himself: if he were "
  '30': 'married, then his wife shall go out with him.  4 If his master have given
    him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children
    shall be her master''s, and he shall go out by himself. 5 And if the servant shall
    plainly say, I love '
  '31': 'my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:  6 Then his
    master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or
    unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and
    he shall serve him for '
  '32': 'ever.  7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not
    go out as the menservants do. 8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed
    her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange
    nation he shall have '
  '33': no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.  9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. 10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
  '34': ' 11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without
    money. 12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.
    13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will
    appoint thee a '
  '35': 'place whither he shall flee.  14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his
    neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he
    may die. 15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put
    to death. 16 And he '
  '36': 'that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall
    surely be put to death.  17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall
    surely be put to death. 18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with
    a stone, or '
  '37': 'with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:  19 If he rise again,
    and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he
    shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
    20 And if a man smite '
  '38': 'his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall
    be surely punished.  21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall
    not be punished: for he is his money. 22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with
    child, so that her fruit '
  '39': 'depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished,
    according as the woman''s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges
    determine.  23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
    24 Eye for eye, '
  '40': 'tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,  25 Burning for burning, wound
    for wound, stripe for stripe. 26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or
    the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye''s sake.
    27 And if he '
  '41': 'smite out his manservant''s tooth, or his maidservant''s tooth; he shall
    let him go free for his tooth''s sake.  28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that
    they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten;
    but the owner of the ox '
  '42': shall be quit.  29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.
  '43': ' 30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom
    of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 31 Whether he have gored a son, or have
    gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. 32 If
    the ox shall push '
  '44': 'a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels
    of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.  33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if
    a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 34
    The owner of the '
  '45': 'pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead

  '34': 'about.  21 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of
    the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon
    his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed,
    and his garments, and '
  '35': 'his sons, and his sons'' garments with him.  22 Also thou shalt take of the
    ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul
    above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right
    shoulder; for it is '
  '36': 'a ram of consecration:  23 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread,
    and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the Lord:
    24 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons;
    and shalt wave '
  '37': 'them for a wave offering before the Lord.  25 And thou shalt receive them
    of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet
    savour before the Lord: it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord. 26 And thou
    shalt take the '
  '38': 'breast of the ram of Aaron''s consecration, and wave it for a wave offering
    before the Lord: and it shall be thy part.  27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast
    of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved,
    and which is heaved '
  '39': 'up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and
    of that which is for his sons:  28 And it shall be Aaron''s and his sons'' by
    a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and
    it shall be an heave '
  '40': 'offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings,
    even their heave offering unto the Lord.  29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall
    be his sons'' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.
    30 And that '
  '41': 'son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh
    into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.  31 And
    thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy
    place. 32 And Aaron '
  '42': 'and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the
    basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  33 And they shall eat
    those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them:
    but a stranger '
  '43': 'shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.  34 And if ought of the flesh
    of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt
    burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. 35 And
    thus shalt thou do '
  '44': 'unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded
    thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.  36 And thou shalt offer every day
    a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar,
    when thou hast made '
  '45': 'an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.  37 Seven
    days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall
    be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy. 38 Now this
    is that which thou '
  '46': 'shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.  39
    The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer
    at even: 40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth
    part of '
  '47': 'an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.  41
    And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to
    the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof,
    for a sweet '
  '48': 'savour, an offering made by fire unto the Lord.  42 This shall be a continual
    burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the
    congregation before the Lord: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.
    43 And there I '
  '49': 'will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified
    by my glory.  44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the
    altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the
    priest''s office. '
  '50': '45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.  46

    of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the Lord their God.'
ExodusBook11:
  '1': "\nChapter 30\n And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim\
    \ wood shalt thou make it. 2 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit\
    \ the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height\
    \ thereof: the horns "
  '2': 'thereof shall be of the same.  3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold,
    the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and
    thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 4 And two golden rings shalt
    thou make to it '
  '3': 'under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it
    shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.  5
    And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. 6
    And thou shalt '
  '4': 'put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy
    seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.  7 And Aaron shall
    burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall
    burn incense upon '
  '5': 'it.  8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon
    it, a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations. 9 Ye shall
    offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither
    shall ye pour '
  '6': 'drink offering thereon.  10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns
    of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in
    the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most
    holy unto the Lord.'
  '7': ' 11 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 12 When thou takest the sum of
    the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom
    for his soul unto the Lord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague
    among them, when '
  '8': 'thou numberest them.  13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among
    them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel
    is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord. 14 Every
    one that passeth '
  '9': 'among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give
    an offering unto the Lord.  15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall
    not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the Lord, to
    make an atonement for '
  '10': 'your souls.  16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
    Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation;
    that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the Lord, to make
    an atonement for '
  '11': 'your souls.  17 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 18 Thou shalt also
    make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt
    put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt
    put water therein. '
  '12': '19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:  20
    When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water,
    that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering
    made by '
  '13': 'fire unto the Lord:  21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that
    they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his
    seed throughout their generations. 22 Moreover the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
    23 Take thou '
  '14': 'also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and
    of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet
    calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,  24 And of cassia five hundred shekels,
    after the shekel of '
  '15': 'the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:  25 And thou shalt make it an oil
    of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall
    be an holy anointing oil. 26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
    therewith, and '
  '16': 'the ark of the testimony,  27 And the table and all his vessels, and the
    candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense, 28 And the altar of burnt
    offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot. 29 And thou shalt sanctify
    them, that they '
  '17': 'may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.  30 And thou shalt
    anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me
    in the priest''s office. 31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel,
    saying, This shall be '
  '18': 'an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.  32 Upon man''s
    flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the
    composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you. 33 Whosoever compoundeth
    any like it, '
  '19': 'or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from
    his people.  34 And the Lord said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte,
    and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall
    there be a '
  '20': 'like weight:  35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the
    art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy: 36 And thou shalt beat
    some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of
    the congregation, '
  '21': 'where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.  37 And as for
    the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to
    the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord. 38 Whosoever
    shall make like unto '
  '22': 'that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people. '
  '23': "\nChapter 31\n And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 2 See, I have called\
    \ by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 3 And\
    \ I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and\
    \ in knowledge, and in all "
  '24': 'manner of workmanship,  4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in
    silver, and in brass, 5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving
    of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 6 And I, behold, I have given
    with him Aholiab, the '
  '25': 'son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are
    wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;  7
    The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy
    seat that is '
  '26': 'thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,  8 And the table and
    his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar
    of incense, 9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the
    laver and his foot, 10 And '
  '27': 'the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the
    garments of his sons, to minister in the priest''s office,  11 And the anointing
    oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded
    thee shall they do.'
  '28': ' 12 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 13 Speak thou also unto the children
    of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between
    me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that
    doth sanctify '
  '29': 'you.  14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every
    one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work
    therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 15 Six days may work
    be done; but in '
  '30': 'the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any
    work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.  16 Wherefore the children
    of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations,
    for a '
  '31': 'perpetual covenant.  17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel
    for ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day
    he rested, and was refreshed. 18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end
    of communing with '
  '32': 'him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with
    the finger of God. '
  '33': "\nChapter 32\n And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out\
    \ of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto\
    \ him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the\
    \ man that brought us up out "
  '34': 'of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  2 And Aaron said
    unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives,
    of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. 3 And all the people
    brake off the golden '
  '35': 'earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.  4 And he
    received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had
    made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought
    thee up out of the '
  '36': 'land of Egypt.  5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and
    Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the Lord. 6 And they
    rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings;
    and the people '
  '37': 'sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.  7 And the Lord said unto
    Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land
    of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: 8 They have turned aside quickly out of the
    way which I '
  '38': 'commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it,
    and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have
    brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.  9 And the Lord said unto Moses, I have
    seen this people, '
  '39': 'and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:  10 Now therefore let me alone,
    that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will
    make of thee a great nation. 11 And Moses besought the Lord his God, and said,
    Lord, why doth thy '
  '40': 'wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the
    land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?  12 Wherefore should the
    Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in
    the mountains, and to '
  '41': 'consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and
    repent of this evil against thy people.  13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
    thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I
    will multiply your seed '
  '42': 'as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give
    unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.  14 And the Lord repented
    of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. 15 And Moses turned, and went
    down from the '
  '43': 'mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were
    written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.  16
    And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven
    upon the '
  '44': 'tables.  17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
    he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. 18 And he said, It is
    not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them
    that cry for being '
  '45': 'overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.  19 And it came to pass,
    as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing:
    and Moses'' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake
    them beneath the '
  '46': 'mount.  20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the
    fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children
    of Israel drink of it. 21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto
    thee, that thou '
  '47': 'hast brought so great a sin upon them?  22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger
    of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief. 23
    For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this
    Moses, the man that '
  '48': 'brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  24
    And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they
    gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. 25 And
    when Moses saw that '
  '49': 'the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among
    their enemies:)  26 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is
    on the Lord''s side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves
    together '
  '50': unto him.  27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.

  '1': ' 28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there
    fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 29 For Moses had said, Consecrate
    yourselves today to the Lord, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother;
    that he may '
  '2': 'bestow upon you a blessing this day.  30 And it came to pass on the morrow,
    that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go
    up unto the Lord; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. 31 And
    Moses returned unto '
  '3': 'the Lord, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made
    them gods of gold.  32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not,
    blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 33 And the Lord
    said unto Moses, '
  '4': 'Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.  34 Therefore
    now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold,
    mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit
    their sin '
  '5': upon them.  35 And the Lord plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
  '6': "\nChapter 33\n And the Lord said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou\
    \ and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the\
    \ land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed\
    \ will I give it: 2 And I "
  '7': 'will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite,
    and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:  3 Unto a land
    flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou
    art a '
  '8': 'stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.  4 And when the people
    heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
    5 For the Lord had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a
    stiffnecked people: I '
  '9': 'will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore
    now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.  6
    And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount
    Horeb. 7 And Moses '
  '10': 'took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp,
    and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every
    one which sought the Lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which
    was without '
  '11': 'the camp.  8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
    that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked
    after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. 9 And it came to pass, as
    Moses entered into the '
  '12': 'tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle,
    and the Lord talked with Moses.  10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand
    at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in
    his tent '
  '13': 'door.  11 And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto
    his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son
    of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. 12 And Moses said unto
    the Lord, See, thou '
  '14': 'sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom
    thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast
    also found grace in my sight.  13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found
    grace in thy sight, shew '
  '15': 'me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight:
    and consider that this nation is thy people.  14 And he said, My presence shall
    go with thee, and I will give thee rest. 15 And he said unto him, If thy presence
    go not with me, '
  '16': 'carry us not up hence.  16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and
    thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us?
    so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon
    the face of the earth. '
  '17': '17 And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast
    spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.  18 And
    he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. 19 And he said, I will make all my
    goodness pass before '
  '18': 'thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be gracious
    to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.  20
    And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.
    21 And the '
  '19': 'Lord said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:  22
    And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in
    a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 23 And
    I will take away '
  '20': 'mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. '
  '21': "\nChapter 34\n And the Lord said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone\
    \ like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were\
    \ in the first tables, which thou brakest. 2 And be ready in the morning, and\
    \ come up in the morning unto "
  '22': 'mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.  3
    And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all
    the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. 4 And he hewed
    two tables of stone '
  '23': 'like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up
    unto mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand the two
    tables of stone.  5 And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
    and proclaimed the '
  '24': 'name of the Lord.  6 And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The
    Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness
    and truth, 7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression
    and sin, and that '
  '25': 'will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon
    the children, and upon the children''s children, unto the third and to the fourth
    generation.  8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
    worshipped. 9 And '
  '26': 'he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray
    thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and
    our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.  10 And he said, Behold, I make a
    covenant: before all '
  '27': 'thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth,
    nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work
    of the Lord: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.  11 Observe
    thou that which I '
  '28': 'command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the
    Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.  12
    Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land
    whither thou '
  '29': 'goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:  13 But ye shall destroy
    their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: 14 For thou shalt
    worship no other god: for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: 15
    Lest thou make a '

    fifty taches of '

    both of them in '

    20 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the
    ephod underneath, '
  '27': 'toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above
    the curious girdle of the ephod.  21 And they did bind the breastplate by his
    rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above
    the curious girdle of the '
  '28': 'ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the
    Lord commanded Moses.  22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all
    of blue. 23 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an
    habergeon, with a band '
  '29': 'round about the hole, that it should not rend.  24 And they made upon the
    hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.
    25 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates
    upon the hem of the '
  '30': robe, round about between the pomegranates;  26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the Lord commanded Moses. 27 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,
  '31': ' 28 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen
    breeches of fine twined linen, 29 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue,
    and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the Lord commanded Moses. 30 And they
    made the plate of '
  '32': 'the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings
    of a signet, Holiness To The Lord.  31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to
    fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the Lord commanded Moses. 32 Thus was all
    the work of the '
  '33': 'tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of
    Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did they.  33 And
    they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches,
    his boards, his '
  '34': 'bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,  34 And the covering of rams'' skins
    dyed red, and the covering of badgers'' skins, and the vail of the covering, 35
    The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat, 36 The table,
    and all the '
  '35': 'vessels thereof, and the shewbread,  37 The pure candlestick, with the lamps
    thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof,
    and the oil for light, 38 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the
    sweet incense, and '
  '36': 'the hanging for the tabernacle door,  39 The brasen altar, and his grate
    of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, 40 The hangings
    of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate,
    his cords, and his '
  '37': pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,  41 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.
  '38': ' 42 According to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so the children of Israel
    made all the work. 43 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they
    had done it as the Lord had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed
    them.'
  '39': "\nChapter 40\n And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 2 On the first day\
    \ of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.\
    \ 3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with\
    \ the vail. 4 And thou "
  '40': 'shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set
    in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps
    thereof.  5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark
    of the testimony, and '
  '41': 'put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.  6 And thou shalt set the
    altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the
    congregation. 7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation
    and the altar, and '
  '42': 'shalt put water therein.  8 And thou shalt set up the court round about,
    and hang up the hanging at the court gate. 9 And thou shalt take the anointing
    oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it,
    and all the vessels '
  '43': 'thereof: and it shall be holy.  10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the
    burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an
    altar most holy. 11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify
    it. 12 And thou shalt '
  '44': 'bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
    and wash them with water.  13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments,
    and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest''s
    office. 14 And thou '
  '45': 'shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:  15 And thou shalt anoint
    them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the
    priest''s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood
    throughout their '
  '46': 'generations.  16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded
    him, so did he. 17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year,
    on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. 18 And Moses
    reared up the '
  '47': tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.  19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the Lord commanded Moses.
  '48': ' 20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on
    the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 21 And he brought the ark
    into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark
    of the testimony; as the '
  '49': 'Lord commanded Moses.  22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation,
    upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. 23 And he set the
    bread in order upon it before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 24 And
    he put the '
  '50': candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.  25 And he lighted the lamps before the Lord; as the Lord commanded Moses.

    priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned
    in one of these, '
  '19': 'and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest''s, as

    a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the Lord; then he
    shall bring for his '
  '20': 'trespass unto the Lord a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy
    estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass

    thing, and shall '
  '21': 'add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall
    make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall
    be forgiven him.  17 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
    forbidden to be '
  '22': 'done by the commandments of the Lord; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty,

    the priest shall '
  '23': 'make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist
    it not, and it shall be forgiven him.  19 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly

    \ or hath deceived his "

    and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing
    therein. 8 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 9 Command Aaron and his sons,
    saying, This is '
  '29': 'the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning
    upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be
    burning in it.  10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
    breeches shall he '
  '30': 'put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with
    the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.  11 And
    he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the
    ashes without the '
  '31': 'camp unto a clean place.  12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning
    in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning,

    of the peace '

    of the flour of '
  '33': 'the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which

    by fire; it is most '

    among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in
    your generations concerning the offerings of the Lord made by fire: every one
    that toucheth them '

    day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering
    perpetual, half '

    made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces
    of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the Lord. 22 And
    the priest of his '
  '38': 'sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever
    unto the Lord; it shall be wholly burnt.  23 For every meat offering for the priest
    shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten. 24 And the Lord spake unto Moses,
    saying, 25 '
  '39': 'Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering:
    In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed

    be eaten of. 24 But in '
  '6': 'the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the Lord withal.  25
    And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto

    unrighteousness in '

    weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the Lord your God,

  '1': "\nChapter 25\n And the Lord spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 2 Speak\
    \ unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which\
    \ I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord. 3 Six years thou\
    \ shalt sow thy field, "
  '2': 'and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;  4
    But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for
    the Lord: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. 5 That which
    groweth of '
  '3': 'its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes
    of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.  6 And the sabbath
    of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy
    maid, and for thy '
  '4': 'hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.  7 And for
    thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof
    be meat. 8 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times
    seven years; and '
  '5': 'the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine
    years.  9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth
    day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound
    throughout all '
  '6': 'your land.  10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
    throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile
    unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return
    every man unto his '
  '7': 'family.  11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,
    neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of
    thy vine undressed. 12 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall
    eat the increase '
  '8': 'thereof out of the field.  13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every
    man unto his possession. 14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest
    ought of thy neighbour''s hand, ye shall not oppress one another: 15 According
    to the number of '
  '9': 'years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto
    the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:  16 According to the
    multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the
    fewness of years thou '
  '10': 'shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years
    of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.  17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another;
    but thou shalt fear thy God:for I am the Lord your God. 18 Wherefore ye shall
    do my statutes, '
  '11': 'and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.  19
    And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein
    in safety. 20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold,
    we shall not '
  '12': 'sow, nor gather in our increase:  21 Then I will command my blessing upon
    you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years. 22 And
    ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until
    her fruits come in '
  '13': 'ye shall eat of the old store.  23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for
    the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me. 24 And in all the
    land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. 25 If thy brother
    be waxen poor, '
  '14': 'and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to
    redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.  26 And if the man
    have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it; 27 Then let him count
    the years of the sale '
  '15': 'thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he
    may return unto his possession.  28 But if he be not able to restore it to him,
    then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until
    the year of '
  '16': 'jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.  29
    And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within
    a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it. 30 And if
    it be '
  '17': 'not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the
    walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his
    generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.  31 But the houses of the villages
    which have no '
  '18': 'wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they
    may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.  32 Notwithstanding the
    cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the
    Levites redeem at any '
  '19': 'time.  33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold,
    and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses
    of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
    34 But the '
  '20': 'field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual
    possession.  35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;
    then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that
    he may live '
  '21': 'with thee.  36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God;
    that thy brother may live with thee. 37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon
    usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase. 38 I am the Lord your God, which
    brought you forth out '
  '22': 'of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.  39
    And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee;
    thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant: 40 But as an hired servant,
    and as a '
  '23': 'sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.  41
    And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall
    return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
    42 For '
  '24': 'they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they
    shall not be sold as bondmen.  43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but
    shalt fear thy God. 44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
    shall be of the '
  '25': 'heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.  45
    Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall
    ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land:
    and they '
  '26': 'shall be your possession.  46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for
    your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your
    bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not
    rule one over another '
  '27': 'with rigour.  47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy
    brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner
    by thee, or to the stock of the stranger''s family: 48 After that he is sold he
    may be redeemed '
  '28': 'again; one of his brethren may redeem him:  49 Either his uncle, or his uncle''s
    son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem
    him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself. 50 And he shall reckon with him
    that bought him '
  '29': 'from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price
    of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time
    of an hired servant shall it be with him.  51 If there be yet many years behind,
    according unto '
  '30': 'them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that
    he was bought for.  52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile,
    then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again
    the price of '
  '31': 'his redemption.  53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and
    the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight. 54 And if he be not
    redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he,
    and his children with '
  '32': 'him.  55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants
    whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.'
  '33': "\nChapter 26\n Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear\
    \ you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your\
    \ land, to bow down unto it: for I am the Lord your God. 2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths,\
    \ and reverence my "
  '34': 'sanctuary: I am the Lord.  3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments,
    and do them; 4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield
    her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 5 And your threshing
    shall '
  '35': 'reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time:
    and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.  6 And
    I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you
    afraid: and I will rid '
  '36': 'evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.  7
    And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
    8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten
    thousand to flight: '
  '37': 'and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.  9 For I will have respect
    unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with
    you. 10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
    11 And I set '
  '38': 'my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.  12 And I will
    walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. 13 I am the Lord
    your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not
    be their bondmen; and '
  '39': 'I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.  14 But if
    ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; 15 And if

    not do all my '

    you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that
    shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed
    in vain, for your '
  '41': 'enemies shall eat it.  17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall

    neither shall '
  '43': 'the trees of the land yield their fruits.  21 And if ye walk contrary unto
    me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you
    according to your sins. 22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall
    rob you of your '

    ways shall be desolate.  23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things,
    but will walk contrary unto me; 24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and
    will punish you '
  '45': 'yet seven times for your sins.  25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that
    shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within
    your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into
    the hand of the '
  '46': 'enemy.  26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall
    bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight:
    and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. 27 And if ye will not for all this hearken
    unto me, but '
  '47': 'walk contrary unto me;  28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury;
    and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins. 29 And ye shall eat
    the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. 30 And I
    will destroy your '
  '48': 'high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases
    of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.  31 And I will make your cities waste,
    and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of
    your sweet '
  '49': 'odours.  32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which
    dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 33 And I will scatter you among the heathen,
    and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your
    cities waste.'
  '50': ' 34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate,

    your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 36 And upon them that are left alive of
    you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and

    of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto
    the Lord.  11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it,
    and eat it with '
  '11': 'unleavened bread and bitter herbs.  12 They shall leave none of it unto the
    morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover
    they shall keep it. 13 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and
    forbeareth to '
  '12': 'keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people:
    because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season, that

    keep the passover '
  '13': 'unto the Lord; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according
    to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the

    was reared up '
  '14': 'the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and
    at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until
    the morning.  16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance
    of fire by night. 17 '
  '15': 'And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the
    children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the
    children of Israel pitched their tents.  18 At the commandment of the Lord the
    children of Israel '
  '16': 'journeyed, and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched: as long as the
    cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.  19 And when the cloud
    tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the
    charge of the '
  '17': 'Lord, and journeyed not.  20 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days
    upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the Lord they abode in their
    tents, and according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed. 21 And so
    it was, when the '
  '18': 'cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in
    the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud
    was taken up, they journeyed.  22 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or
    a year, that the '
  '19': 'cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel
    abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.  23
    At the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents, and at the commandment
    of the Lord '
  '20': 'they journeyed: they kept the charge of the Lord, at the commandment of the
    Lord by the hand of Moses. '
  '21': "\nChapter 10\n And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Make thee two trumpets\
    \ of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them\
    \ for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps. 3 And\
    \ when they shall blow with "
  '22': 'them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the
    tabernacle of the congregation.  4 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then
    the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves
    unto thee. 5 When '
  '23': 'ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.  6
    When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side
    shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys. 7 But when
    the '
  '24': 'congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not
    sound an alarm.  8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;
    and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.
    9 And if ye go to '
  '25': 'war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow
    an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your God,
    and ye shall be saved from your enemies.  10 Also in the day of your gladness,
    and in your solemn '
  '26': 'days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets
    over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that
    they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the Lord your God.  11
    And it came to pass '
  '27': 'on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud
    was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.  12 And the children of
    Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested
    in the wilderness '
  '28': 'of Paran.  13 And they first took their journey according to the commandment
    of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 14 In the first place went the standard of the
    camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was
    Nahshon the son of '
  '29': 'Amminadab.  15 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar
    was Nethaneel the son of Zuar. 16 And over the host of the tribe of the children
    of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon. 17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and
    the sons of Gershon '
  '30': 'and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.  18 And the standard
    of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host
    was Elizur the son of Shedeur. 19 And over the host of the tribe of the children
    of Simeon was '
  '31': 'Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.  20 And over the host of the tribe of the
    children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 21 And the Kohathites set forward,
    bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came.
    22 And the '
  '32': 'standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to
    their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.  23 And over
    the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
    24 And over the host '
  '33': 'of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.  25
    And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, which was the
    rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer
    the son of '
  '34': 'Ammishaddai.  26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher
    was Pagiel the son of Ocran. 27 And over the host of the tribe of the children
    of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan. 28 Thus were the journeyings of the children
    of Israel according '
  '35': 'to their armies, when they set forward.  29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the
    son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses'' father in law, We are journeying unto the
    place of which the Lord said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will
    do thee good: for the '
  '36': 'Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel.  30 And he said unto him, I will
    not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred. 31 And he said,
    Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the
    wilderness, and thou '
  '37': 'mayest be to us instead of eyes.  32 And it shall be, if thou go with us,
    yea, it shall be, that what goodness the Lord shall do unto us, the same will
    we do unto thee. 33 And they departed from the mount of the Lord three days''
    journey: and the ark of '
  '38': 'the covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days'' journey, to
    search out a resting place for them.  34 And the cloud of the Lord was upon them
    by day, when they went out of the camp. 35 And it came to pass, when the ark set
    forward, that Moses '
  '39': said, Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.  36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel.
  '40': "\nChapter 11\n And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and\
    \ the Lord heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the Lord burnt\

    he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the Lord burnt among
    them. 4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children
    of Israel also '
  '42': 'wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?  5 We remember the
    fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the
    leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: 6 But now our soul is dried away: there
    is nothing at all, '
  '43': 'beside this manna, before our eyes.  7 And the manna was as coriander seed,
    and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium. 8 And the people went about,
    and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it
    in pans, and made '
  '44': 'cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.  9 And when
    the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. 10 Then Moses
    heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his
    tent: and the anger of '

    24 The place was '

    prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.
    32 But as for you, '
  '6': 'your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.  33 And your children shall
    wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases
    be wasted in the wilderness. 34 After the number of the days in which ye searched
    the land, '
  '7': 'even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even
    forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.  35 I the Lord have said,
    I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together
    against me: in this '
  '8': 'wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.  36 And the men,
    which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation
    to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, 37 Even those men
    that did bring '
  '9': 'up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the Lord.  38
    But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men
    that went to search the land, lived still. 39 And Moses told these sayings unto
    all the children of '
  '10': 'Israel: and the people mourned greatly.  40 And they rose up early in the
    morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here,
    and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised: for we have sinned.
    41 And Moses said, '
  '11': 'Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the Lord? but it shall
    not prosper.  42 Go not up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye be not smitten
    before your enemies. 43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before
    you, and ye shall '
  '12': 'fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the Lord, therefore the
    Lord will not be with you.  44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless
    the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
    45 Then the '

    them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah. '
  '14': "\nChapter 15\n And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Speak unto the children\

    \ burnt offering, or a "
  '15': 'sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn
    feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the Lord, of the herd or of the flock:  4
    Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the Lord bring a meat offering of
    a tenth deal of flour '
  '16': 'mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.  5 And the fourth part of
    an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering
    or sacrifice, for one lamb. 6 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering
    two tenth deals of '
  '17': 'flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.  7 And for a drink offering
    thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the

    in performing '
  '18': 'a vow, or peace offerings unto the Lord:  9 Then shall he bring with a bullock
    a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.
    10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering
    made by fire, '
  '19': 'of a sweet savour unto the Lord.  11 Thus shall it be done for one bullock,
    or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. 12 According to the number that ye shall
    prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number. 13 All that are
    born of the '
  '20': 'country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering
    made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.  14 And if a stranger sojourn with
    you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering
    made by fire, of a '
  '21': 'sweet savour unto the Lord; as ye do, so he shall do.  15 One ordinance shall
    be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth

    all the congregation '

    and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord, and
    their sin offering before the Lord, for their ignorance:  26 And it shall be forgiven
    all the '

    among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.  27 And if any soul sin through
    ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.
    28 And the priest '
  '29': 'shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth
    by ignorance before the Lord, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven
    him.  29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for
    him that is '

    the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the Lord; and that soul shall be
    cut off from among '

    his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon
    him. 32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a
    man that gathered '

    brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 34 And they put
    him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him. 35 And the
    Lord said unto '
  '33': 'Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone
    him with stones without the camp.  36 And all the congregation brought him without
    the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses.
    37 And the '

    you, that the God of '
  '42': 'Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near
    to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before

    For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the
    Lord: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him? 12 And Moses sent to call
    Dathan and Abiram, the '
  '44': 'sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:  13 Is it a small thing that
    thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill
    us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us? 14
    Moreover thou hast '
  '45': 'not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us
    inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men?
    we will not come up.  15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the Lord, Respect
    not thou their '
  '46': 'offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of
    them.  16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the Lord,
    thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 17 And take every man his censer, and put
    incense in them, and '
  '47': 'bring ye before the Lord every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers;
    thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.  18 And they took every man his
    censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door
    of the tabernacle of '

    against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory
    of the Lord appeared unto all the congregation. 20 And the Lord spake unto Moses
    and unto '
  '49': 'Aaron, saying,  21 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that
    I may consume them in a moment. 22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O

NumbersBook8:
  '1': ' 26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the

    Abiram, on every side: '
  '2': 'and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and
    their wives, and their sons, and their little children.  28 And Moses said, Hereby
    ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not
    done them of mine '
  '3': 'own mind.  29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
    visited after the visitation of all men; then the Lord hath not sent me. 30 But

    with all that '
  '4': 'appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand
    that these men have provoked the Lord.  31 And it came to pass, as he had made
    an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under
    them: 32 And '
  '5': 'the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all
    the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.  33 They, and all that
    appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them:
    and they '
  '6': 'perished from among the congregation.  34 And all Israel that were round about
    them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.
    35 And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty
    men that '
  '7': 'offered incense.  36 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 37 Speak unto
    Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning,
    and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed. 38 The censers of these
    sinners against '
  '8': 'their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar:

    before the Lord; '
  '10': 'that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the Lord said to him by the
    hand of Moses.  41 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel
    murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of
    the Lord. 42 And '
  '11': 'it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against
    Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold,
    the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.  43 And Moses and Aaron
    came before the '
  '12': 'tabernacle of the congregation.  44 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
    45 Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment.
    And they fell upon their faces. 46 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and
    put fire '
  '13': 'therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation,
    and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the Lord; the
    plague is begun.  47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst
    of the '
  '14': 'congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he
    put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.  48 And he stood between
    the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 49 Now they that died in the
    plague were fourteen '

    lay them up '

  '13': "\nChapter 20\n Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,\
    \ into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and\
    \ Miriam died there, and was buried there. 2 And there was no water for the congregation:\
    \ and they "
  '14': 'gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.  3 And the
    people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our
    brethren died before the Lord! 4 And why have ye brought up the congregation of
    the Lord into this '
  '15': 'wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?  5 And wherefore have
    ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is
    no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there
    any water to drink. 6 '
  '16': 'And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door
    of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the
    glory of the Lord appeared unto them.  7 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
    8 Take the rod, and '
  '17': 'gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak
    ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou
    shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation
    and their beasts '
  '18': 'drink.  9 And Moses took the rod from before the Lord, as he commanded him.
    10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and
    he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
    11 And Moses '
  '19': 'lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water
    came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.  12 And
    the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me
    in the eyes of the '
  '20': 'children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the
    land which I have given them.  13 This is the water of Meribah; because the children
    of Israel strove with the Lord, and he was sanctified in them. 14 And Moses sent
    messengers '
  '21': 'from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest
    all the travail that hath befallen us:  15 How our fathers went down into Egypt,
    and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
    16 And '
  '22': 'when we cried unto the Lord, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath
    brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost
    of thy border:  17 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not
    pass through '
  '23': 'the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water
    of the wells: we will go by the king''s high way, we will not turn to the right
    hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.  18 And Edom said unto
    him, Thou shalt not pass '
  '24': 'by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.  19 And the children
    of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink
    of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else,
    go through on my '
  '25': 'feet.  20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against
    him with much people, and with a strong hand. 21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel
    passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him. 22 And the
    children of Israel, '
  '26': 'even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.  23
    And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land
    of Edom, saying, 24 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not
    enter into the '
  '27': 'land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled
    against my word at the water of Meribah.  25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and
    bring them up unto mount Hor: 26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them
    upon Eleazar his son: '
  '28': 'and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.  27 And
    Moses did as the Lord commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight
    of all the congregation. 28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put
    them upon Eleazar his '
  '29': 'son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar
    came down from the mount.  29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was
    dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.'
  '30': "\nChapter 21\n And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south,\
    \ heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against\
    \ Israel, and took some of them prisoners. 2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord,\
    \ and said, If thou wilt "
  '31': 'indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their
    cities.  3 And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the
    Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the
    name of the place '
  '32': 'Hormah.  4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to
    compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because
    of the way. 5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have
    ye brought us up '
  '33': 'out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is
    there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.  6 And the Lord sent
    fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel
    died. 7 Therefore '
  '34': 'the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against
    the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents
    from us. And Moses prayed for the people.  8 And the Lord said unto Moses, Make
    thee a fiery '
  '35': 'serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one
    that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.  9 And Moses made a serpent
    of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten
    any man, when '
  '36': 'he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.  10 And the children of Israel
    set forward, and pitched in Oboth. 11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched
    at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising. 12
    From thence they '
  '37': 'removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.  13 From thence they removed,
    and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh
    out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab
    and the Amorites. 14 '
  '38': 'Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, What he did in
    the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,  15 And at the stream of the brooks that
    goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab. 16 And from
    thence they went to '
  '39': 'Beer: that is the well whereof the Lord spake unto Moses, Gather the people
    together, and I will give them water.  17 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up,
    O well; sing ye unto it: 18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people
    digged it, by '
  '40': 'the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness
    they went to Mattanah:  19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to
    Bamoth: 20 And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the
    top of Pisgah, which '
  '41': 'looketh toward Jeshimon.  21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of
    the Amorites, saying, 22 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the
    fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but
    we will go along by '
  '42': 'the king''s high way, until we be past thy borders.  23 And Sihon would not
    suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together,
    and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought
    against '
  '43': 'Israel.  24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
    his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border
    of the children of Ammon was strong. 25 And Israel took all these cities: and
    Israel dwelt in all '
  '44': 'the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.  26
    For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against
    the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
    27 Wherefore '
  '45': 'they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon
    be built and prepared:  28 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from
    the city of Sihon: it hath consumed ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places
    of Arnon. 29 Woe to '
  '46': 'thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons
    that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.  30
    We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them
    waste even unto '
  '47': 'Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.  31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of
    the Amorites. 32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
    thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there. 33 And they turned and went
    up by the way of '
  '48': 'Bashan: and og the king of bashan went out against them, he, and all his
    people, to the battle at edrei.  34 And the Lord said unto Moses, Fear him not:

    thou shalt do to him as '
  '49': 'thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.  35 So
    they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him
    alive: and they possessed his land.'

  '1': ' 3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab
    was distressed because of the children of Israel. 4 And Moab said unto the elders
    of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the
    ox licketh up the '
  '2': 'grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at
    that time.  5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor,
    which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him,
    saying, Behold, '
  '3': 'there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the
    earth, and they abide over against me:  6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse
    me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail,
    that we may smite '
  '4': 'them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou
    blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.  7 And the elders of
    Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their
    hand; and they came '
  '5': 'unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.  8 And he said unto them,
    Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the Lord shall speak
    unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. 9 And God came unto Balaam,
    and said, What '
  '6': 'men are these with thee?  10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor,
    king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying, 11 Behold, there is a people come out
    of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure
    I shall be '
  '7': 'able to overcome them, and drive them out.  12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou
    shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.
    13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get
    you into your land: '
  '8': 'for the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you.  14 And the princes
    of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with
    us. 15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
    16 And they came to '
  '9': 'Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing,
    I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:  17 For I will promote thee unto
    very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore,
    I pray thee, curse me '
  '10': 'this people.  18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak,
    If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the
    word of the Lord my God, to do less or more. 19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry
    ye also here this '
  '11': 'night, that I may know what the Lord will say unto me more.  20 And God came
    unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up,
    and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou
    do. 21 And Balaam '
  '12': 'rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of
    Moab.  22 And God''s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the Lord
    stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass,
    and his two servants '
  '13': 'were with him.  23 And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the
    way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way,
    and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. 24
    But the angel of the '
  '14': 'Lord stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall
    on that side.  25 And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she thrust herself
    unto the wall, and crushed Balaam''s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
    26 And the '
  '15': 'angel of the Lord went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no
    way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.  27 And when the ass saw
    the angel of the Lord, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam''s anger was kindled,
    and he smote the ass '
  '16': 'with a staff.  28 And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said
    unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three
    times? 29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there
    were a sword in mine '
  '17': 'hand, for now would I kill thee.  30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not
    I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day?
    was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay. 31 Then the Lord opened
    the eyes of Balaam, and '
  '18': 'he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawn in
    his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.  32 And the angel
    of the Lord said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times?
    behold, I went '
  '19': 'out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:  33 And the
    ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me,
    surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive. 34 And Balaam said unto
    the angel of the '
  '20': 'Lord, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against
    me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.  35 And the
    angel of the Lord said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I
    shall speak unto thee, '
  '21': 'that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.  36 And
    when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of
    Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast. 37 And Balak
    said unto Balaam, Did '
  '22': 'I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto
    me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?  38 And Balaam said unto Balak,
    Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word
    that God '
  '23': 'putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.  39 And Balaam went with Balak,
    and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth. 40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent
    to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. 41 And it came to pass on the
    morrow, that Balak '
  '24': 'took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence
    he might see the utmost part of the people. '
  '25': "\nChapter 23\n And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and\
    \ prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. 2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken;\
    \ and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. 3 And Balaam\
    \ said unto Balak, Stand "
  '26': 'by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the Lord will come to
    meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high
    place.  4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars,
    and I have offered '
  '27': 'upon every altar a bullock and a ram.  5 And the Lord put a word in Balaam''s
    mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. 6 And he returned
    unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of
    Moab. 7 And he '
  '28': 'took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from
    Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come,
    defy Israel.  8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,
    whom the Lord hath '
  '29': 'not defied?  9 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills
    I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among
    the nations. 10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
    part of Israel? Let me '
  '30': 'die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!  11 And
    Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine
    enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether. 12 And he answered and
    said, Must I not take '
  '31': 'heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in my mouth?  13 And Balak said
    unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest
    see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all:
    and curse me them '
  '32': 'from thence.  14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top
    of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
    15 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the
    Lord yonder. 16 And '
  '33': 'the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto
    Balak, and say thus.  17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt
    offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath
    the Lord spoken? 18 '
  '34': 'And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto
    me, thou son of Zippor:  19 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the
    son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath
    he spoken, and '
  '35': 'shall he not make it good?  20 Behold, I have received commandment to bless:
    and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it. 21 He hath not beheld iniquity in
    Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is with him,
    and the shout of '
  '36': 'a king is among them.  22 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were
    the strength of an unicorn. 23 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither
    is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said
    of Jacob and '
  '37': 'of Israel, What hath God wrought!  24 Behold, the people shall rise up as
    a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until
    he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain. 25 And Balak said unto Balaam,
    Neither curse '
  '38': 'them at all, nor bless them at all.  26 But Balaam answered and said unto
    Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do? 27
    And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another
    place; peradventure it '
  '39': 'will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.  28 And Balak
    brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward jeshimon. 29 And Balaam
    said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks
    and seven rams. 30 '
  '40': 'And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every
    altar. '
  '41': "\nChapter 24\n And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel,\
    \ he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face\
    \ toward the wilderness. 2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding\
    \ in his tents "
  '42': 'according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.  3 And he
    took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose
    eyes are open hath said: 4 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw
    the vision of the '
  '43': 'Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:  5 How goodly
    are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel! 6 As the valleys are they
    spread forth, as gardens by the river''s side, as the trees of lign aloes which
    the Lord hath planted, '
  '44': 'and as cedar trees beside the waters.  7 He shall pour the water out of his
    buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than
    Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted. 8 God brought him forth out of Egypt;
    he hath as it were '
  '45': 'the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and

    \ bond; he shall not break his "
  '4': 'word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.  3 If
    a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond, being in her
    father''s house in her youth; 4 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith
    she hath bound her '
  '5': 'soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall
    stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.  5 But if
    her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of
    her bonds wherewith she '
  '6': 'hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the Lord shall forgive her, because
    her father disallowed her.  6 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed,
    or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 7 And her husband
    heard it, and held '
  '7': 'his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and

    not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the Lord shall forgive her.  13
    Every vow, and every '

    half, which Moses divided from the men that warred, 43 (Now the half that pertained

    of the host, the '
  '37': 'captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:  49
    And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which
    are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. 50 We have therefore
    brought an '
  '38': 'oblation for the Lord, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains,
    and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls
    before the Lord.  51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even
    all wrought '
  '39': 'jewels.  52 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the
    Lord, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen

    every man for '

  '1': "Chapter 1\n These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side\
    \ Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran,\
    \ and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 2 (There are eleven days'\
    \ journey from Horeb by "
  '2': 'the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)  3 And it came to pass in the fortieth
    year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto
    the children of Israel, according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment
    unto '
  '3': 'them;  4 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in
    Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 5 On this
    side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 6 The
    Lord our God spake '
  '4': 'unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:  7 Turn
    you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all
    the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in
    the south, and by the '
  '5': 'sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great
    river, the river Euphrates.  8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and
    possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
    to give unto '
  '6': 'them and to their seed after them.  9 And I spake unto you at that time, saying,
    I am not able to bear you myself alone: 10 The Lord your God hath multiplied you,
    and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. 11 (The Lord
    God of your '
  '7': 'fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as
    he hath promised you!)  12 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your
    burden, and your strife? 13 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among
    your tribes, and '
  '8': 'I will make them rulers over you.  14 And ye answered me, and said, The thing
    which thou hast spoken is good for us to do. 15 So I took the chief of your tribes,
    wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and
    captains over '
  '9': 'hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers
    among your tribes.  16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the
    causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his
    brother, and the '
  '10': 'stranger that is with him.  17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment;
    but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the
    face of man; for the judgment is God''s: and the cause that is too hard for you,
    bring it unto me, and '
  '11': 'I will hear it.  18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which
    ye should do. 19 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great
    and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites,
    as the Lord our '
  '12': 'God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.  20 And I said unto you, Ye
    are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord our God doth give unto
    us. 21 Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess
    it, as the Lord '
  '13': 'God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.  22
    And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us,
    and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we
    must go up, and '
  '14': 'into what cities we shall come.  23 And the saying pleased me well: and I
    took twelve men of you, one of a tribe: 24 And they turned and went up into the
    mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out. 25 And they
    took of the fruit of '
  '15': 'the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word
    again, and said, It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us.  26 Notwithstanding
    ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God:
    27 And ye '
  '16': 'murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us, he hath brought
    us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites,
    to destroy us.  28 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,
    saying, The '
  '17': 'people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up
    to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.  29 Then I
    said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. 30 The Lord your God which
    goeth before you, he '
  '18': 'shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before
    your eyes;  31 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the Lord thy
    God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until
    ye came into this '
  '19': 'place.  32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God, 33 Who
    went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in,
    in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.
    34 And the Lord heard '
  '20': 'the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,  35 Surely there
    shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I
    sware to give unto your fathers. 36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall
    see it, and to him '
  '21': 'will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because
    he hath wholly followed the Lord.  37 Also the Lord was angry with me for your
    sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither. 38 But Joshua the son of Nun,
    which standeth '
  '22': 'before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel
    to inherit it.  39 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey,
    and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they
    shall go in '

    as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of
    the Red sea. 41 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the
    Lord, we will go up and '
  '24': 'fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us. And when ye had
    girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.  42
    And the Lord said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not
    among you; lest '
  '25': 'ye be smitten before your enemies.  43 So I spake unto you; and ye would
    not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord, and went presumptuously
    up into the hill. 44 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out
    against you, and '
  '26': 'chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.  45
    And ye returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord would not hearken to your
    voice, nor give ear unto you. 46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto
    the days that ye '
  '27': 'abode there. '
  '28': "\nChapter 2\n Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by\
    \ the way of the Red sea, as the Lord spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir\
    \ many days. 2 And the Lord spake unto me, saying, 3 Ye have compassed this mountain\
    \ long enough: turn you "
  '29': 'northward.  4 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through
    the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they
    shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: 5 Meddle
    not with them; for I '
  '30': 'will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because
    I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.  6 Ye shall buy meat of them
    for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that
    ye may drink. 7 '
  '31': 'For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth
    thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the Lord thy God
    hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.  8 And when we passed by from our
    brethren the '
  '32': 'children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from
    Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness
    of Moab.  9 And the Lord said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend
    with them in battle: '
  '33': 'for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given
    Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.  10 The Emims dwelt therein in times
    past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; 11 Which also were accounted
    giants, '
  '34': 'as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.  12 The Horims also dwelt
    in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed
    them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of
    his '
  '35': 'possession, which the Lord gave unto them.  13 Now rise up, said I, and get
    you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered. 14 And the space in
    which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was
    thirty and eight '
  '36': 'years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among
    the host, as the Lord sware unto them.  15 For indeed the hand of the Lord was
    against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. 16
    So it came to pass, '
  '37': 'when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,  17
    That the Lord spake unto me, saying, 18 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the
    coast of Moab, this day: 19 And when thou comest nigh over against the children
    of Ammon, distress them '
  '38': 'not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children
    of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for
    a possession.  20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein
    in old time; '
  '39': 'and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;  21 A people great, and many, and
    tall, as the Anakims; but the Lord destroyed them before them; and they succeeded
    them, and dwelt in their stead: 22 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt
    in Seir, when he '
  '40': 'destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt
    in their stead even unto this day:  23 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even
    unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and
    dwelt in their '
  '41': 'stead.)  24 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:
    behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his
    land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. 25 This day will I
    begin to put the dread '
  '42': 'of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven,
    who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of
    thee.  26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king
    of Heshbon with '
  '43': 'words of peace, saying,  27 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along
    by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. 28 Thou
    shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that
    I may drink: only I '
  '44': 'will pass through on my feet;  29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in
    Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over
    Jordan into the land which the Lord our God giveth us. 30 But Sihon king of Heshbon
    would not let us '
  '45': 'pass by him: for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart
    obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.  31
    And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before
    thee: begin to '
  '46': 'possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.  32 Then Sihon came out against
    us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. 33 And the Lord our God delivered
    him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. 34 And we took
    all his cities at '
  '47': 'that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones,
    of every city, we left none to remain:  35 Only the cattle we took for a prey
    unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took. 36 From Aroer, which
    is by the brink of '
  '48': 'the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead,
    there was not one city too strong for us: the Lord our God delivered all unto
    us:  37 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto
    any place of the '
  '49': 'river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the
    Lord our God forbad us. '
  '50': "\nChapter 3\n Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king\

DeuteronomyBook2:
  '1': ' 2 And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all
    his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst
    unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 3 So the Lord our God
    delivered into our '
  '2': 'hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until
    none was left to him remaining.  4 And we took all his cities at that time, there
    was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region
    of Argob, the '
  '3': 'kingdom of Og in Bashan.  5 All these cities were fenced with high walls,
    gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. 6 And we utterly destroyed
    them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women,
    and children, of every '
  '4': 'city.  7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey
    to ourselves. 8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the
    Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount
    Hermon; 9 '
  '5': '(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)  10
    All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and
    Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 11 For only Og king of Bashan remained
    of the '
  '6': 'remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in
    Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four
    cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.  12 And this land, which we
    possessed at that '
  '7': 'time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and
    the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.  13 And the
    rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half
    tribe of Manasseh; all '
  '8': 'the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.  14
    Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri
    and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this
    day. 15 And I '
  '9': 'gave Gilead unto Machir.  16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites
    I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even
    unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 17 The plain
    also, and Jordan, '
  '10': 'and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even
    the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.  18 And I commanded you at that time,
    saying, The Lord your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass
    over armed before '
  '11': 'your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.  19
    But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have
    much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you; 20 Until the
    Lord have given rest '
  '12': 'unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the
    land which the Lord your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye
    return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.  21 And I commanded
    Joshua at that time, '
  '13': 'saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these
    two kings: so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.  22
    Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord your God he shall fight for you. 23 And I
    besought the Lord '
  '14': 'at that time, saying,  24 O Lord God, thou hast begun to shew thy servant
    thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth,
    that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might? 25 I pray thee,
    let me go over, and '
  '15': 'see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.  26
    But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the
    Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.
    27 Get thee up into '
  '16': 'the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward,
    and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.  28
    But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over '
  '17': before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.  29 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.
  '18': "\nChapter 4\n Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto\
    \ the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in\
    \ and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you. 2 Ye shall\
    \ not add unto the word "
  '19': 'which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may
    keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.  3 Your eyes have
    seen what the Lord did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor,
    the Lord thy '
  '20': 'God hath destroyed them from among you.  4 But ye that did cleave unto the
    Lord your God are alive every one of you this day. 5 Behold, I have taught you
    statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do
    so in the land '
  '21': 'whither ye go to possess it.  6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your
    wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all
    these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding
    people. 7 For what '
  '22': 'nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our
    God is in all things that we call upon him for?  8 And what nation is there so
    great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I
    set before you this day? '
  '23': '9 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget
    the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all
    the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons'' sons;  10 Specially
    the day that thou '
  '24': 'stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Gather
    me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn
    to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may
    teach their '
  '25': 'children.  11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
    burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
    12 And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice
    of the '
  '26': 'words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.  13 And he declared
    unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments;
    and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. 14 And the Lord commanded me at that
    time to teach you '
  '27': 'statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over
    to possess it.  15 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no
    manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the
    midst of the fire: '
  '28': '16 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude
    of any figure, the likeness of male or female,  17 The likeness of any beast that
    is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 18 The
    likeness of any '
  '29': 'thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the
    waters beneath the earth:  19 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and
    when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven,
    shouldest be '
  '30': 'driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided
    unto all nations under the whole heaven.  20 But the Lord hath taken you, and
    brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a
    people of inheritance, '
  '31': 'as ye are this day.  21 Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes,
    and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that
    good land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance: 22 But I must
    die in this '
  '32': 'land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good
    land.  23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your
    God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any
    thing, which '
  '33': 'the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee.  24 For the Lord thy God is a consuming
    fire, even a jealous God. 25 When thou shalt beget children, and children''s children,
    and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and
    make a '
  '34': 'graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight
    of the Lord thy God, to provoke him to anger:  26 I call heaven and earth to witness
    against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto
    ye go over '
  '35': 'Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly
    be destroyed.  27 And the Lord shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall
    be left few in number among the heathen, whither the Lord shall lead you. 28 And
    there ye '
  '36': 'shall serve gods, the work of men''s hands, wood and stone, which neither
    see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.  29 But if from thence thou shalt seek the
    Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with
    all thy soul. 30 When '
  '37': 'thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in
    the latter days, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt be obedient unto
    his voice;  31 (For the Lord thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee,
    neither destroy '
  '38': 'thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.  32
    For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that
    God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other,
    whether there '
  '39': 'hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like
    it?  33 Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the
    fire, as thou hast heard, and live? 34 Or hath God assayed to go and take him
    a nation from the midst '
  '40': 'of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war,
    and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according
    to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?  35 Unto
    thee it was shewed, '
  '41': 'that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God; there is none else beside
    him.  36 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct
    thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words
    out of the midst of '
  '42': 'the fire.  37 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their
    seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of
    Egypt; 38 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou
    art, to bring thee in, '
  '43': 'to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.  39 Know therefore
    this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above,
    and upon the earth beneath: there is none else. 40 Thou shalt keep therefore his
    statutes, '
  '44': 'and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well
    with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy
    days upon the earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, for ever.  41 Then Moses
    severed three cities '
  '45': 'on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;  42 That the slayer might flee
    thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times
    past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 43 Namely, Bezer
    in the wilderness, in '
  '46': 'the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites;
    and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.  44 And this is the law which Moses set
    before the children of Israel: 45 These are the testimonies, and the statutes,
    and the judgments, '
  '47': 'which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out
    of Egypt.  46 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the
    land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children
    of Israel smote, '
  '48': 'after they were come forth out of Egypt:  47 And they possessed his land,
    and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this
    side Jordan toward the sunrising; 48 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river
    Arnon, even unto '
  '49': mount Sion, which is Hermon,  49 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
  '50': "\nChapter 5\n And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel,\
    \ the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may\

  '1': ' 3 The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us,
    who are all of us here alive this day. 4 The Lord talked with you face to face
    in the mount out of the midst of the fire, 5 (I stood between the Lord and you
    at that time, to shew '
  '2': 'you the word of the Lord: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went
    not up into the mount;) saying,  6 I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out
    of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 7 Thou shalt have none other
    gods before me. 8 '
  '3': 'Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that
    is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters

    unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,  10 And shewing mercy
    unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. 11 Thou shalt not
    take the name of '
  '5': 'the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh
    his name in vain.  12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God
    hath commanded thee. 13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 14 But
    the seventh day '
  '6': 'is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou,
    nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine
    ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
    gates; that thy '
  '7': 'manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.  15 And remember
    that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought
    thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the
    Lord thy God '
  '8': 'commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.  16 Honour thy father and thy mother,
    as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that
    it may go well with thee, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 17 Thou
    shalt not '
  '9': 'kill.  18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery. 19 Neither shalt thou steal.
    20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour. 21 Neither shalt
    thou desire thy neighbour''s wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour''s house,
    his field, or his '
  '10': 'manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is
    thy neighbour''s.  22 These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the
    mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with
    a great voice: and he '
  '11': 'added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them
    unto me.  23 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of
    the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me,
    even all the heads of '
  '12': 'your tribes, and your elders;  24 And ye said, Behold, the Lord our God hath
    shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the

    25 Now '
  '13': 'therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear
    the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die.  26 For who is there
    of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the
    midst of the fire, '
  '14': 'as we have, and lived?  27 Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God
    shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee;

    when ye spake '
  '15': 'unto me; and the Lord said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of
    this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they

    me, and keep all my '

    with all thy soul, and '

    the way, and when '

    a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. 9 And

    Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God, as ye tempted him in Massah. 17 Ye shall
    diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, and his testimonies, and
    his statutes, '
  '28': 'which he hath commanded thee.  18 And thou shalt do that which is right and
    good in the sight of the Lord: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest

    unto thy son, We '
  '30': 'were Pharaoh''s bondmen in Egypt; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with
    a mighty hand:  22 And the Lord shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon
    Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes: 23 And he brought
    us out from '
  '31': 'thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto

    this day. 25 And it '

    3 Neither shalt '
  '35': 'thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his
    son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.  4 For they will turn away
    thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of
    the Lord be kindled '
  '36': 'against you, and destroy thee suddenly.  5 But thus shall ye deal with them;
    ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their
    groves, and burn their graven images with fire. 6 For thou art an holy people
    unto the Lord thy '
  '37': 'God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself,
    above all people that are upon the face of the earth.  7 The Lord did not set
    his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people;
    for ye were the '
  '38': 'fewest of all people:  8 But because the Lord loved you, and because he would
    keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you
    out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the
    hand of Pharaoh king '
  '39': 'of Egypt.  9 Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful
    God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments
    to a thousand generations; 10 And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to
    destroy '
  '40': 'them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his
    face.  11 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the
    judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them. 12 Wherefore it shall come
    to pass, if ye '
  '41': 'hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the Lord thy God
    shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:  13

    fruit of thy '

    more than I; how can '

  '19': 'thou art a stiffnecked people.  7 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst
    the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart
    out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious
    against the '
  '20': 'Lord.  8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was
    angry with you to have destroyed you. 9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive
    the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with
    you, then I abode '
  '21': 'in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink
    water:  10 And the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the
    finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the Lord
    spake with you in '
  '22': 'the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.  11 And
    it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the Lord gave
    me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. 12 And the Lord said
    unto me, Arise, get '
  '23': 'thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth
    out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the
    way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.  13 Furthermore
    the Lord spake unto '
  '24': 'me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:  14
    Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven:
    and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. 15 So I turned
    and came '
  '25': 'down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of
    the covenant were in my two hands.  16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned
    against the Lord your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside
    quickly out of the '
  '26': 'way which the Lord had commanded you.  17 And I took the two tables, and
    cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. 18 And I fell
    down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither
    eat bread, nor drink '
  '27': 'water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the
    sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.  19 For I was afraid of the anger
    and hot displeasure, wherewith the Lord was wroth against you to destroy you.
    But the Lord hearkened '
  '28': 'unto me at that time also.  20 And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to
    have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. 21 And I took your
    sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground
    it very small, '
  '29': 'even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the
    brook that descended out of the mount.  22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and
    at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the Lord to wrath. 23 Likewise when the Lord
    sent you from '
  '30': 'Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you;
    then ye rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and ye believed
    him not, nor hearkened to his voice.  24 Ye have been rebellious against the Lord
    from the day that I '
  '31': 'knew you.  25 Thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights,
    as I fell down at the first; because the Lord had said he would destroy you. 26
    I prayed therefore unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, destroy not thy people
    and thine '
  '32': 'inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast
    brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  27 Remember thy servants, Abraham,
    Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their
    wickedness, nor '
  '33': 'to their sin:  28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because
    the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and
    because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
    29 Yet they are thy '
  '34': 'people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power
    and by thy stretched out arm. '
  '35': "\nChapter 10\n At that time the Lord said unto me, Hew thee two tables of\

    \ an ark of wood. 2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the\
    \ first tables which thou "
  '36': 'brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.  3 And I made an ark of shittim
    wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the
    mount, having the two tables in mine hand. 4 And he wrote on the tables, according
    to the first '
  '37': 'writing, the ten commandments, which the Lord spake unto you in the mount
    out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the Lord gave them
    unto me.  5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables
    in the ark which I '
  '38': 'had made; and there they be, as the Lord commanded me.  6 And the children
    of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera:
    there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the
    priest''s office in '
  '39': 'his stead.  7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah
    to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. 8 At that time the Lord separated the
    tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the
    Lord to minister unto '
  '40': 'him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.  9 Wherefore Levi hath no part
    nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance, according as the
    Lord thy God promised him. 10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first
    time, forty days '
  '41': 'and forty nights; and the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also, and the
    Lord would not destroy thee.  11 And the Lord said unto me, Arise, take thy journey
    before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto
    their fathers '
  '42': 'to give unto them.  12 And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require
    of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,
    and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, 13 To
    keep the commandments '

    also, with all that therein is. 15 Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers
    to love them, and he '

    Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. 17
    For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty,

  '33': 'that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord thy God shall bless thee
    in the land whither thou goest to possess it.  17 But if thine heart turn away,
    so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and
    serve them; 18 I '
  '34': 'denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall
    not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to
    possess it.  19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I
    have set before you '
  '35': 'life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou
    and thy seed may live:  20 That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou
    mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life,
    and the length of '
  '36': 'thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord sware unto thy
    fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them. '
  '37': "\nChapter 31\n And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. 2 And\
    \ he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more\
    \ go out and come in: also the Lord hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over\
    \ this Jordan. 3 The Lord "
  '38': 'thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from
    before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before
    thee, as the Lord hath said.  4 And the Lord shall do unto them as he did to Sihon
    and to Og, kings '
  '39': 'of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.  5 And the
    Lord shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto
    all the commandments which I have commanded you. 6 Be strong and of a good courage,
    fear not, nor '
  '40': 'be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee;
    he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.  7 And Moses called unto Joshua, and
    said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for
    thou must go with this '
  '41': 'people unto the land which the Lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give
    them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.  8 And the Lord, he it is that
    doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake
    thee: fear not, '
  '42': 'neither be dismayed.  9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the
    priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and
    unto all the elders of Israel. 10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end
    of every seven years, '
  '43': 'in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,  11
    When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he
    shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 12
    Gather the people '
  '44': 'together, men and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy
    gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God,
    and observe to do all the words of this law:  13 And that their children, which
    have not known any '
  '45': 'thing, may hear, and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as ye live
    in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.  14 And the Lord said unto
    Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present
    yourselves in the '
  '46': 'tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and
    Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.  15
    And the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar
    of the cloud stood '
  '47': 'over the door of the tabernacle.  16 And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold,
    thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring
    after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them,
    and will forsake '
  '48': 'me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.  17 Then my anger
    shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will
    hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles
    shall befall them; so '

    our God is not among us?  18 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all
    the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.
    19 Now therefore '
  '50': 'write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in
    their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. '

  '1': ' 20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their
    fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled
    themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them,
    and provoke me, '
  '2': 'and break my covenant.  21 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and
    troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;
    for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their
    imagination which '
  '3': 'they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I
    sware.  22 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children
    of Israel. 23 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong
    and of a good '
  '4': 'courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I
    sware unto them: and I will be with thee.  24 And it came to pass, when Moses
    had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
    25 That Moses '
  '5': 'commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying,  26
    Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of
    the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee. 27 For I know
    thy '
  '6': 'rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this
    day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord; and how much more after my death?  28
    Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak
    these words in '
  '7': 'their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.  29 For I know
    that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the
    way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because
    ye will do '
  '8': evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.  30 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.
  '9': "\nChapter 32\n Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,\
    \ the words of my mouth. 2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall\
    \ distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers\
    \ upon the grass: 3 Because "
  '10': 'I will publish the name of the Lord: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.  4
    He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth
    and without iniquity, just and right is he. 5 They have corrupted themselves,
    their spot is not '
  '11': 'the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.  6
    Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father
    that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee? 7 Remember
    the days of old, '
  '12': 'consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew
    thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.  8 When the Most High divided to the
    nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds
    of the people '
  '13': 'according to the number of the children of Israel.  9 For the Lord''s portion
    is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. 10 He found him in a desert
    land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him,
    he kept him as the '
  '14': 'apple of his eye.  11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her
    young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: 12
    So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him. 13 He made
    him ride on the '
  '15': 'high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and
    he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;  14
    Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of
    Bashan, and goats, '
  '16': 'with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of
    the grape.  15 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art
    grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him,
    and lightly esteemed '
  '17': 'the Rock of his salvation.  16 They provoked him to jealousy with strange
    gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger. 17 They sacrificed unto devils,
    not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your
    fathers feared '
  '18': 'not.  18 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten
    God that formed thee. 19 And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them, because of
    the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. 20 And he said, I will hide my
    face from them, I '
  '19': 'will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation,
    children in whom is no faith.  21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which
    is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move
    them to jealousy '
  '20': 'with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish
    nation.  22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest
    hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations
    of the '
  '21': 'mountains.  23 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows
    upon them. 24 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,
    and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with
    the poison of '
  '22': 'serpents of the dust.  25 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy
    both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.
    26 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of
    them to cease from '
  '23': 'among men:  27 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
    adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our
    hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this. 28 For they are a nation void
    of counsel, neither '
  '24': 'is there any understanding in them.  29 O that they were wise, that they
    understood this, that they would consider their latter end! 30 How should one
    chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold
    them, and the Lord had '
  '25': 'shut them up?  31 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
    being judges. 32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
    Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter: 33 Their
    wine is the '
  '26': 'poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.  34 Is not this laid up in
    store with me, and sealed up among my treasures? 35 To me belongeth vengeance
    and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity
    is at hand, and the '
  '27': 'things that shall come upon them make haste.  36 For the Lord shall judge
    his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power
    is gone, and there is none shut up, or left. 37 And he shall say, Where are their
    gods, their rock in '
  '28': 'whom they trusted,  38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank
    the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your
    protection. 39 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill,
    and I make alive; '
  '29': 'I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.  40
    For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. 41 If I whet my glittering
    sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies,
    and '
  '30': 'will reward them that hate me.  42 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,
    and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the
    captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. 43 Rejoice, O ye nations,
    with his '
  '31': 'people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance
    to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.  44
    And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people,
    he, and Hoshea '
  '32': 'the son of Nun.  45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to
    all Israel: 46 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which
    I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe
    to do, all the words of '
  '33': 'this law.  47 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life:
    and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over
    Jordan to possess it. 48 And the Lord spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,
    49 Get thee up '
  '34': 'into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab,
    that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto
    the children of Israel for a possession:  50 And die in the mount whither thou
    goest up, and be '
  '35': 'gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was
    gathered unto his people:  51 Because ye trespassed against me among the children
    of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye
    sanctified me not in '
  '36': the midst of the children of Israel.  52 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
  '37': "\nChapter 33\n And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed\
    \ the children of Israel before his death. 2 And he said, The Lord came from Sinai,\
    \ and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came\
    \ with ten "
  '38': 'thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.  3 Yea,
    he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy
    feet; every one shall receive of thy words. 4 Moses commanded us a law, even the
    inheritance of the '
  '39': 'congregation of Jacob.  5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of
    the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together. 6 Let Reuben live,
    and not die; and let not his men be few. 7 And this is the blessing of Judah:
    and he said, Hear, Lord, '
  '40': 'the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient
    for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.  8 And of Levi he said,
    Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah,
    and with whom '
  '41': 'thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;  9 Who said unto his father and
    to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor
    knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.
    10 They shall teach '
  '42': 'Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee,
    and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.  11 Bless, Lord, his substance, and
    accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against
    him, and of them '
  '43': 'that hate him, that they rise not again.  12 And of Benjamin he said, The
    beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him
    all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders. 13 And of Joseph he
    said, Blessed of the '
  '44': 'Lord be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for
    the deep that coucheth beneath,  14 And for the precious fruits brought forth
    by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon, 15 And for the
    chief things of the '
  '45': 'ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,  16
    And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good
    will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph,
    and upon the top of '
  '46': 'the head of him that was separated from his brethren.  17 His glory is like
    the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with
    them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are
    the ten thousands of '
  '47': 'Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.  18 And of Zebulun he said,
    Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents. 19 They shall
    call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness:
    for they '
  '48': 'shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.  20
    And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and
    teareth the arm with the crown of the head. 21 And he provided the first part
    for himself, '
  '49': 'because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with
    the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord, and his judgments

    over where the young child was. 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with
    exceeding great joy. 11 '
  '17': 'And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary
    his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their
    treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.  12
    And being warned of '
  '18': 'God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their
    own country another way.  13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of
    the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child
    and his mother, '
  '19': 'and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod
    will seek the young child to destroy him.  14 When he arose, he took the young
    child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: 15 And was there until
    the death of Herod: '
  '20': 'that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
    Out of Egypt have I called my son.  16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked
    of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children
    that were in '
  '21': 'Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according
    to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled
    that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, '
  '22': "\nChapter 3\n In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness\
    \ of Judaea, 2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 3\
    \ For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of\
    \ one crying in the "
  '23': 'wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.  4 And
    the same John had his raiment of camel''s hair, and a leathern girdle about his
    loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. 5 Then went out to him Jerusalem,
    and all Judaea, '
  '24': 'and all the region round about Jordan,  6 And were baptized of him in Jordan,
    confessing their sins. 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come
    to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you
    to flee from the '
  '25': 'wrath to come?  8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: 9 And
    think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto
    you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 10 And
    now also the axe is '
  '26': 'laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not
    forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  11 I indeed baptize you
    with water unto repentance. but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose
    shoes I am not '
  '27': 'worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:  12
    Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his
    wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. 13
    Then cometh Jesus '
  '28': 'from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.  14 But John forbad
    him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? 15 And
    Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us
    to fulfil all '
  '29': 'righteousness. Then he suffered him.  16 And Jesus, when he was baptized,
    went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him,
    and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 17
    And lo a voice from '
  '30': 'heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. '
  '31': "\nChapter 4\n Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to\
    \ be tempted of the devil. 2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights,\
    \ he was afterward an hungred. 3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If\
    \ thou be the Son of God, "
  '32': 'command that these stones be made bread.  4 But he answered and said, It
    is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth
    out of the mouth of God. 5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and
    setteth him on a '
  '33': 'pinnacle of the temple,  6 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God,
    cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning
    thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy
    foot against a '
  '34': 'stone.  7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
    the Lord thy God. 8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain,
    and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 9 And saith
    unto him, All '
  '35': 'these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.  10
    Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt
    worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 11 Then the devil leaveth
    him, and, behold, '
  '36': 'angels came and ministered unto him.  12 Now when Jesus had heard that John
    was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; 13 And leaving Nazareth, he came
    and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon
    and Nephthalim: 14 '
  '37': 'That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,  15
    The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond
    Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; 16 The people which sat in darkness saw great
    light; and to them '
  '38': 'which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.  17 From
    that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven
    is at hand. 18 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon
    called Peter, and '
  '39': 'Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.  19
    And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. 20 And
    they straightway left their nets, and followed him. 21 And going on from thence,
    he saw other two '
  '40': 'brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with
    Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.  22 And they immediately
    left the ship and their father, and followed him. 23 And Jesus went about all
    Galilee, teaching '
  '41': 'in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing
    all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.  24 And his
    fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that
    were taken with divers '
  '42': 'diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those
    which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.  25 And
    there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis,
    and from Jerusalem, '
  '43': 'and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan. '
  '44': "\nChapter 5\n And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and\
    \ when he was set, his disciples came unto him: 2 And he opened his mouth, and\
    \ taught them, saying, 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom\
    \ of heaven. 4 Blessed are "
  '45': 'they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.  5 Blessed are the meek: for
    they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
    righteousness: for they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful: for they
    shall obtain mercy. '
  '46': '8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.  9 Blessed are the
    peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 10 Blessed are they
    which are persecuted for righteousness'' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
    11 Blessed are '
  '47': 'ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner
    of evil against you falsely, for my sake.  12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad:
    for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which
    were before you. 13 Ye '
  '48': 'are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
    shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and
    to be trodden under foot of men.  14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that
    is set on an hill '
  '49': 'cannot be hid.  15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel,
    but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 16 Let
    your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify
    your Father which '
  '50': 'is in heaven.  17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
    I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.'

  '1': ' 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one
    tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 19 Whosoever
    therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so,
    he shall be called the '
  '2': 'least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the
    same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  20 For I say unto you, That
    except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees,
    ye shall in '
  '3': 'no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.  21 Ye have heard that it was said
    of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in
    danger of the judgment: 22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his
    brother without a '
  '4': 'cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother,
    Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall
    be in danger of hell fire.  23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar,
    and there '
  '5': 'rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  24 Leave there thy
    gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and
    then come and offer thy gift. 25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou
    art in the way with '
  '6': 'him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge
    deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  26 Verily I say unto
    thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost
    farthing. 27 Ye '
  '7': 'have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:  28
    But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed
    adultery with her already in his heart. 29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck '
  '8': 'it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
    members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  30
    And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is
    profitable for '
  '9': 'thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should
    be cast into hell.  31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let
    him give her a writing of divorcement: 32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall
    put away his '
  '10': 'wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery:
    and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.  33 Again,
    ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear
    thyself, but shalt '
  '11': 'perform unto the Lord thine oaths:  34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all;
    neither by heaven; for it is God''s throne: 35 Nor by the earth; for it is his
    footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. 36 Neither
    shalt thou swear '
  '12': 'by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.  37 But
    let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these
    cometh of evil. 38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and
    a tooth for a tooth: '
  '13': '39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite
    thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  40 And if any man will sue
    thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. 41 And whosoever
    shall compel '
  '14': 'thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  42 Give to him that asketh thee, and
    from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. 43 Ye have heard that it
    hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 44 But I
    say unto you, Love '
  '15': 'your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and
    pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  45 That ye may be
    the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise
    on the evil and on '
  '16': 'the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  46 For if ye love
    them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
    47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even
    the publicans so? '
  '17': '48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. '
  '18': "\nChapter 6\n Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of\
    \ them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. 2 Therefore\
    \ when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites\
    \ do in the "
  '19': 'synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I
    say unto you, They have their reward.  3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy
    left hand know what thy right hand doeth: 4 That thine alms may be in secret:
    and thy Father which '
  '20': 'seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.  5 And when thou prayest,
    thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the
    synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily
    I say unto you, '
  '21': 'They have their reward.  6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet,
    and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy
    Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 7 But when ye pray, use
    not vain '
  '22': 'repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for
    their much speaking.  8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth
    what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. 9 After this manner therefore
    pray ye: Our '
  '23': 'Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  10 Thy kingdom come, Thy
    will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. 11 Give us this day our daily bread.
    12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 13 And lead us not into
    temptation, but '
  '24': 'deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,
    for ever. Amen.  14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
    will also forgive you: 15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither
    will your Father '
  '25': 'forgive your trespasses.  16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites,
    of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto
    men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 17 But thou, when
    thou fastest, '
  '26': 'anoint thine head, and wash thy face;  18 That thou appear not unto men to
    fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret,
    shall reward thee openly. 19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where
    moth and '
  '27': 'rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:  20 But lay
    up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,
    and where thieves do not break through nor steal: 21 For where your treasure is,
    there will your '
  '28': 'heart be also.  22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye
    be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. 23 But if thine eye be evil,
    thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee
    be darkness, how '
  '29': 'great is that darkness!  24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will
    hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise
    the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no
    thought for your '
  '30': 'life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what
    ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?  26
    Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather
    into barns; yet '
  '31': 'your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?  27
    Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? 28 And why
    take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;
    they toil not, neither do '
  '32': 'they spin:  29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory
    was not arrayed like one of these. 30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of
    the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not
    much more clothe you, O '
  '33': 'ye of little faith?  31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we
    eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 32 (For after
    all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that
    ye have need of all '
  '34': 'these things.  33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
    and all these things shall be added unto you. 34 Take therefore no thought for
    the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient
    unto the day '
  '35': 'is the evil thereof. '
  '36': "\nChapter 7\n Judge not, that ye be not judged. 2 For with what judgment\
    \ ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured\
    \ to you again. 3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,\
    \ but considerest not the "
  '37': 'beam that is in thine own eye?  4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let
    me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
    5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt
    thou see clearly to '
  '38': 'cast out the mote out of thy brother''s eye.  6 Give not that which is holy
    unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them
    under their feet, and turn again and rend you. 7 Ask, and it shall be given you;
    seek, and ye shall '
  '39': 'find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:  8 For every one that asketh
    receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
    9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
    10 Or if he '
  '40': 'ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?  11 If ye then, being evil, know
    how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which
    is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? 12 Therefore all things whatsoever
    ye would that '
  '41': 'men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the
    prophets.  13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad
    is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
    14 Because strait is the '
  '42': 'gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that
    find it.  15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep''s clothing,
    but inwardly they are ravening wolves. 16 Ye shall know them by their fruits.
    Do men gather grapes of '
  '43': 'thorns, or figs of thistles?  17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good
    fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bring
    forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 19 Every
    tree that bringeth '
  '44': 'not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  20 Wherefore
    by their fruits ye shall know them. 21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,
    Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my
    Father which is in '
  '45': 'heaven.  22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
    in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful
    works? 23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me,
    ye that '
  '46': 'work iniquity.  24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and
    doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
    25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon
    that house; and it '
  '47': 'fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.  26 And every one that heareth
    these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man,
    which built his house upon the sand: 27 And the rain descended, and the floods
    came, and the winds '
  '48': 'blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.  28
    And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished
    at his doctrine: 29 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the
    scribes.'
  '49': "\nChapter 8\n When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed\
    \ him. 2 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if\
    \ thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 3 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched\
    \ him, saying, I "
  '50': will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.  4 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

    to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed
    with devils, coming '
  '12': 'out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.  29
    And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou
    Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? 30 And there was
    a good way off '
  '13': 'from them an herd of many swine feeding.  31 So the devils besought him,
    saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. 32 And
    he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of
    swine: and, behold, '
  '14': 'the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and
    perished in the waters.  33 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways
    into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of
    the devils. 34 And, '
  '15': 'behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they
    besought him that he would depart out of their coasts. '
  '16': "\nChapter 9\n And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into\
    \ his own city. 2 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying\
    \ on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son,\
    \ be of good cheer; thy sins "
  '17': 'be forgiven thee.  3 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,
    This man blasphemeth. 4 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think
    ye evil in your hearts? 5 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven
    thee; or to say, '
  '18': 'Arise, and walk?  6 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on
    earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up
    thy bed, and go unto thine house. 7 And he arose, and departed to his house. 8
    But when the '
  '19': 'multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such
    power unto men.  9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
    Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And
    he arose, and '
  '20': 'followed him.  10 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house,
    behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
    11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your
    Master with '
  '21': 'publicans and sinners?  12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them,
    They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. 13 But go ye
    and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not
    come to call the '
  '22': 'righteous, but sinners to repentance.  14 Then came to him the disciples
    of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast
    not? 15 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn,
    as long as the bridegroom '
  '23': 'is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
    from them, and then shall they fast.  16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto
    an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment,
    and the rent is made '
  '24': 'worse.  17 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles
    break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine
    into new bottles, and both are preserved. 18 While he spake these things unto
    them, behold, there came '
  '25': 'a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead:
    but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.  19 And Jesus arose, and
    followed him, and so did his disciples. 20 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased
    with an issue '
  '26': 'of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:  21
    For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.
    22 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good
    comfort; thy '
  '27': 'faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.  23
    And when Jesus came into the ruler''s house, and saw the minstrels and the people
    making a noise, 24 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but
    sleepeth. And '
  '28': 'they laughed him to scorn.  25 But when the people were put forth, he went
    in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose. 26 And the fame hereof went
    abroad into all that land. 27 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed
    him, crying, and '
  '29': 'saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.  28 And when he was come into
    the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that
    I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. 29 Then touched he their
    eyes, saying, '
  '30': 'According to your faith be it unto you.  30 And their eyes were opened; and
    Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it. 31 But they, when
    they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country. 32 As they went
    out, behold, they '
  '31': 'brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.  33 And when the devil
    was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never
    so seen in Israel. 34 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the
    prince of the devils. '
  '32': '35 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues,
    and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every
    disease among the people.  36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with
    compassion on '
  '33': 'them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no
    shepherd.  37 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous,
    but the labourers are few; 38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that
    he will send forth '
  '34': 'labourers into his harvest. '
  '35': "\nChapter 10\n And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave\
    \ them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner\
    \ of sickness and all manner of disease. 2 Now the names of the twelve apostles\
    \ are these; The first, "
  '36': 'Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee,
    and John his brother;  3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican;
    James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; 4 Simon
    the Canaanite, '
  '37': 'and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  5 These twelve Jesus sent forth,
    and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any
    city of the Samaritans enter ye not: 6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the
    house of Israel. 7 And '
  '38': 'as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.  8 Heal the sick,
    cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received,
    freely give. 9 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 10
    Nor scrip for your '
  '39': 'journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman
    is worthy of his meat.  11 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire
    who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence. 12 And when ye come into
    an house, '
  '40': 'salute it.  13 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but
    if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. 14 And whosoever shall not
    receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake
    off the dust of '
  '41': 'your feet.  15 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the
    land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city. 16 Behold,
    I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents,
    and harmless as '
  '42': 'doves.  17 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils,
    and they will scourge you in their synagogues; 18 And ye shall be brought before
    governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.
    19 But when they '
  '43': 'deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall
    be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.  20 For it is not ye that
    speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. 21 And the brother
    shall deliver up the '
  '44': 'brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up
    against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.  22 And ye shall be
    hated of all men for my name''s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be
    saved. 23 But when they '
  '45': 'persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you,
    Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.  24
    The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. 25 It is
    enough for the '
  '46': 'disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have
    called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of
    his household?  26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that
    shall not be '
  '47': 'revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.  27 What I tell you in darkness,
    that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.
    28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but
    rather '
  '48': 'fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.  29 Are not
    two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground
    without your Father. 30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Fear
    ye not therefore, ye '
  '49': 'are of more value than many sparrows.  32 Whosoever therefore shall confess
    me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. 33

    they say, '

    wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: 21 Woe
    unto thee, '
  '14': 'Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done
    in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in
    sackcloth and ashes.  22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre
    and Sidon at the '

    been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
    24 But I say unto '

    \ do that which is not "
  '21': 'lawful to do upon the sabbath day.  3 But he said unto them, Have ye not
    read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; 4 How
    he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful
    for him to eat, '

    into their synagogue: '
  '24': '10 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked
    him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse

    have one sheep, and if '

    it out?  12 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful
    to do well on the sabbath days. 13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine
    hand. And he '
  '26': 'stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.  14 Then
    the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy
    him. 15 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes
    followed him, '

    20 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till
    he send forth '
  '29': 'judgment unto victory.  21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust. 22 Then
    was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed
    him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. 23 And all the people
    were amazed, and '
  '30': 'said, Is not this the son of David?  24 But when the Pharisees heard it,
    they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of
    the devils. 25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom
    divided against itself '
  '31': 'is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself
    shall not stand:  26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself;
    how shall then his kingdom stand? 27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by
    whom do your children '
  '32': 'cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.  28 But if I cast out
    devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. 29 Or else
    how can one enter into a strong man''s house, and spoil his goods, except he first
    bind the strong '
  '33': 'man? and then he will spoil his house.  30 He that is not with me is against
    me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. 31 Wherefore I say unto
    you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy
    against the '
  '34': 'Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.  32 And whosoever speaketh a word

    the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. 39 But
    he answered and '
  '38': 'said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and
    there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:  40 For
    as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale''s belly; so shall the Son
    of man be three days '
  '39': 'and three nights in the heart of the earth.  41 The men of Nineveh shall
    rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented
    at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. 42 The queen
    of the south '
  '40': 'shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it:
    for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
    and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.  43 When the unclean spirit is gone
    out of a man, he '
  '41': 'walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.  44 Then he saith,
    I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth
    it empty, swept, and garnished. 45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven
    other '
  '42': 'spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and
    the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto
    this wicked generation.  46 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother
    and his brethren '
  '43': 'stood without, desiring to speak with him.  47 Then one said unto him, Behold,
    thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. 48 But
    he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my
    brethren? 49 And he '

    But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and
    understandeth it; '
  '7': 'which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty,
    some thirty.  24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
    heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25 But while
    men slept, his '
  '8': 'enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.  26 But when
    the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
    27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou
    sow good seed in '
  '9': 'thy field? from whence then hath it tares?  28 He said unto them, An enemy
    hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather
    them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also
    the wheat with '
  '10': 'them.  30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest
    I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in
    bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 31 Another parable put
    he forth unto '
  '11': 'them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which
    a man took, and sowed in his field:  32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds:
    but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so
    that the birds of '
  '12': 'the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.  33 Another parable spake
    he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and
    hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. 34 All these things
    spake Jesus unto the '
  '13': 'multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:  35
    That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open
    my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the
    foundation of the world.'
  '14': ' 36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his
    disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the
    field. 37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the
    Son of man; 38 The '
  '15': 'field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the
    tares are the children of the wicked one;  39 The enemy that sowed them is the
    devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 40
    As therefore the tares '
  '16': 'are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.  41
    The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom
    all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And shall cast them into
    a '
  '17': 'furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  43 Then shall
    the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath
    ears to hear, let him hear. 44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure
    hid in a field; '
  '18': 'the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and
    selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.  45 Again, the kingdom of heaven
    is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: 46 Who, when he had found
    one pearl of great '
  '19': 'price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.  47 Again, the kingdom
    of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every
    kind: 48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered
    the good into '
  '20': 'vessels, but cast the bad away.  49 So shall it be at the end of the world:
    the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, 50 And
    shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing
    of teeth. 51 Jesus '
  '21': 'saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him,
    Yea, Lord.  52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed
    unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth
    forth out of '
  '22': 'his treasure things new and old.  53 And it came to pass, that when Jesus
    had finished these parables, he departed thence. 54 And when he was come into
    his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished,
    and said, '
  '23': 'Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?  55 Is not this
    the carpenter''s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James,
    and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? 56 And his sisters, are they not all with us?
    Whence then hath this man '
  '24': all these things?  57 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. 58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
  '25': "\nChapter 14\n At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,\
    \ 2 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the\
    \ dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. 3 For Herod\
    \ had laid hold on John, and "
  '26': 'bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias'' sake, his brother Philip''s
    wife.  4 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. 5 And
    when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted
    him as a prophet. 6 '
  '27': 'But when Herod''s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before
    them, and pleased Herod.  7 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever
    she would ask. 8 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me
    here John '
  '28': 'Baptist''s head in a charger.  9 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for
    the oath''s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given
    her. 10 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. 11 And his head was brought
    in a charger, and '
  '29': 'given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.  12 And his disciples
    came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus. 13 When Jesus
    heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the
    people had heard '
  '30': 'thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.  14 And Jesus went
    forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and
    he healed their sick. 15 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying,
    This is a desert '
  '31': 'place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go
    into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.  16 But Jesus said unto them,
    They need not depart; give ye them to eat. 17 And they say unto him, We have here
    but five loaves, and '
  '32': 'two fishes.  18 He said, Bring them hither to me. 19 And he commanded the
    multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes,
    and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples,
    and the '
  '33': 'disciples to the multitude.  20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and
    they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. 21 And they that
    had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children. 22 And straightway
    Jesus '
  '34': 'constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the
    other side, while he sent the multitudes away.  23 And when he had sent the multitudes
    away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come,
    he was there '
  '35': 'alone.  24 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves:
    for the wind was contrary. 25 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went
    unto them, walking on the sea. 26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the
    sea, they were '
  '36': 'troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.  27 But straightway
    Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. 28 And
    Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the
    water. 29 And '
  '37': 'he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on
    the water, to go to Jesus.  30 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid;
    and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. 31 And immediately Jesus
    stretched forth '
  '38': 'his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore
    didst thou doubt?  32 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
    33 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth
    thou art the Son of '
  '39': 'God.  34 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
    35 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all
    that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; 36 And
    besought him that '
  '40': 'they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were
    made perfectly whole. '
  '41': "\nChapter 15\n Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem,\
    \ saying, 2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they\
    \ wash not their hands when they eat bread. 3 But he answered and said unto them,\
    \ Why do ye also "
  '42': 'transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?  4 For God commanded,
    saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let
    him die the death. 5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
    It is a gift, by '
  '43': 'whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;  6 And honour not his father
    or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none
    effect by your tradition. 7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
    8 This people '
  '44': 'draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips;
    but their heart is far from me.  9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for
    doctrines the commandments of men. 10 And he called the multitude, and said unto
    them, Hear, and '
  '45': 'understand:  11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that
    which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. 12 Then came his disciples,
    and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard
    this saying? 13 '
  '46': 'But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not
    planted, shall be rooted up.  14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the
    blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. 15 Then
    answered Peter and said '
  '47': 'unto him, Declare unto us this parable.  16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet
    without understanding? 17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in
    at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? 18 But those
    things which '
  '48': 'proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.  19
    For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,
    thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 20 These are the things which defile a man:
    but to eat with '
  '49': 'unwashen hands defileth not a man.  21 Then Jesus went thence, and departed
    into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. 22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out
    of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou
    son of David; my '
  '50': daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.  23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

  '1': ' 24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
    house of Israel. 25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 26
    But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children''s bread, and to
    cast it to dogs. 27 '
  '2': 'And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from
    their masters'' table.  28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great
    is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole
    from that very hour. '
  '3': '29 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee;
    and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.  30 And great multitudes came
    unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many
    others, and cast them '
  '4': 'down at Jesus'' feet; and he healed them:  31 Insomuch that the multitude
    wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to
    walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. 32 Then Jesus
    called his disciples '
  '5': 'unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue
    with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away
    fasting, lest they faint in the way.  33 And his disciples say unto him, Whence
    should we have so '
  '6': 'much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?  34 And Jesus
    saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little
    fishes. 35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 36 And he
    took the seven '
  '7': 'loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples,
    and the disciples to the multitude.  37 And they did all eat, and were filled:
    and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full. 38 And they
    that did '
  '8': eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.  39 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
  '9': "\nChapter 16\n The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired\
    \ him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. 2 He answered and said unto\
    \ them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.\
    \ 3 And in the morning, "
  '10': 'It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites,
    ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?  4
    A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign
    be '
  '11': 'given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.  5
    And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take
    bread. 6 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the
    Pharisees and '
  '12': 'of the Sadducees.  7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because
    we have taken no bread. 8 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye
    of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
    9 Do ye not yet '
  '13': 'understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how
    many baskets ye took up?  10 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and
    how many baskets ye took up? 11 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake
    it not to you '
  '14': 'concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and
    of the Sadducees?  12 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of
    the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
    13 When Jesus came '
  '15': 'into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom
    do men say that I the Son of man am?  14 And they said, Some say that thou art
    John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 15
    He saith unto them, '
  '16': 'But whom say ye that I am?  16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art
    the Christ, the Son of the living God. 17 And Jesus answered and said unto him,
    Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
    thee, but my Father '
  '17': 'which is in heaven.  18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and
    upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail
    against it. 19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and
    whatsoever thou shalt '
  '18': 'bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on
    earth shall be loosed in heaven.  20 Then charged he his disciples that they should
    tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. 21 From that time forth began Jesus
    to shew unto his '
  '19': 'disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of
    the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the
    third day.  22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far
    from thee, Lord: this '
  '20': 'shall not be unto thee.  23 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee
    behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things
    that be of God, but those that be of men. 24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples,
    If any man will come '
  '21': 'after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  25
    For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life
    for my sake shall find it. 26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the
    whole world, and lose '
  '22': 'his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  27 For
    the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then
    he shall reward every man according to his works. 28 Verily I say unto you, There
    be some standing '
  '23': 'here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming
    in his kingdom. '
  '24': "\nChapter 17\n And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his\
    \ brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, 2 And was transfigured\
    \ before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as\
    \ the light. 3 And, "
  '25': 'behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.  4 Then
    answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou
    wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and
    one for Elias. 5 '
  '26': 'While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold
    a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
    pleased; hear ye him.  6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face,
    and were sore '
  '27': 'afraid.  7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
    8 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only. 9
    And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the
    vision to no man, '
  '28': 'until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.  10 And his disciples
    asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? 11 And
    Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all
    things. 12 But I say '
  '29': 'unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done
    unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of
    them.  13 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
    14 And when they '
  '30': 'were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down
    to him, and saying,  15 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore
    vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. 16 And I
    brought him to thy '
  '31': 'disciples, and they could not cure him.  17 Then Jesus answered and said,
    O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall
    I suffer you? bring him hither to me. 18 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed
    out of him: '
  '32': 'and the child was cured from that very hour.  19 Then came the disciples
    to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? 20 And Jesus said unto
    them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as
    a grain of mustard '
  '33': 'seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and
    it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.  21 Howbeit this kind
    goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. 22 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus
    said unto them, '
  '34': 'The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:  23 And they shall
    kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding
    sorry. 24 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money
    came to Peter, and '
  '35': 'said, Doth not your master pay tribute?  25 He saith, Yes. And when he was
    come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of
    whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children,
    or of strangers? 26 '
  '36': 'Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children
    free.  27 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and
    cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened
    his mouth, '
  '37': 'thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and
    thee. '
  '38': "\nChapter 18\n At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who\
    \ is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 2 And Jesus called a little child\
    \ unto him, and set him in the midst of them, 3 And said, Verily I say unto you,\
    \ Except ye be converted, and "
  '39': 'become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.  4
    Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest
    in the kingdom of heaven. 5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my
    name receiveth '
  '40': 'me.  6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me,
    it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he
    were drowned in the depth of the sea. 7 Woe unto the world because of offences!
    for it must needs '
  '41': 'be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!  8
    Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from
    thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having
    two hands or two '
  '42': 'feet to be cast into everlasting fire.  9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck
    it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one
    eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. 10 Take heed that
    ye despise not one '
  '43': 'of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do
    always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.  11 For the Son of man
    is come to save that which was lost. 12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred
    sheep, and one of them '
  '44': 'be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the
    mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  13 And if so be that he find
    it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety
    and nine which went '
  '45': 'not astray.  14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
    that one of these little ones should perish. 15 Moreover if thy brother shall
    trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if
    he shall hear thee, '
  '46': 'thou hast gained thy brother.  16 But if he will not hear thee, then take
    with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
    may be established. 17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
    church: but if he '
  '47': 'neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a
    publican.  18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be
    bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
    19 Again I say unto '
  '48': 'you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they
    shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  20 For
    where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of
    them. 21 Then came '
  '49': 'Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and
    I forgive him? till seven times?  22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee,
    Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. 23 Therefore is the kingdom
    of heaven likened '
  '50': unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.  24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.

    and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. 26 The
    servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with
    me, and I will pay '
  '2': 'thee all.  27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
    loosed him, and forgave him the debt. 28 But the same servant went out, and found
    one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands
    on him, and took him '
  '3': 'by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.  29 And his fellowservant fell
    down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will
    pay thee all. 30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
    should pay the debt. '
  '4': '31 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and
    came and told unto their lord all that was done.  32 Then his lord, after that
    he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that
    debt, because thou '
  '5': 'desiredst me:  33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant,
    even as I had pity on thee? 34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the
    tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. 35 So likewise shall
    my heavenly '
  '6': 'Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his
    brother their trespasses. '
  '7': "\nChapter 19\n And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings,\
    \ he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;\
    \ 2 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there. 3 The Pharisees\
    \ also came unto him, "
  '8': 'tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his
    wife for every cause?  4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read,
    that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, 5 And said,
    For this cause shall a '
  '9': 'man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain
    shall be one flesh?  6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore
    God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. 7 They say unto him, Why did
    Moses then '
  '10': 'command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?  8 He saith
    unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away
    your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. 9 And I say unto you, Whosoever
    shall put away '
  '11': 'his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth
    adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.  10 His
    disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not
    good to marry. 11 '
  '12': 'But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom
    it is given.  12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother''s
    womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be
    eunuchs, which '
  '13': 'have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven''s sake. He that is
    able to receive it, let him receive it.  13 Then were there brought unto him little
    children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked
    them. 14 But '
  '14': 'Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me:
    for of such is the kingdom of heaven.  15 And he laid his hands on them, and departed
    thence. 16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing
    shall I do, '
  '15': 'that I may have eternal life?  17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou
    me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into
    life, keep the commandments. 18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt
    do no murder, Thou '
  '16': 'shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false
    witness,  19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
    as thyself. 20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from
    my youth up: what '
  '17': 'lack I yet?  21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell
    that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven:
    and come and follow me. 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
    sorrowful: for he had '
  '18': 'great possessions.  23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto
    you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 24 And again
    I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than
    for a rich man '
  '19': 'to enter into the kingdom of God.  25 When his disciples heard it, they were
    exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? 26 But Jesus beheld them, and
    said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
    27 Then '
  '20': 'answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed
    thee; what shall we have therefore?  28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say
    unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of
    man shall sit in the '
  '21': 'throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve
    tribes of Israel.  29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
    sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name''s
    sake, shall receive '
  '22': an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.  30 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
  '23': "\nChapter 20\n For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,\
    \ which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. 2 And\
    \ when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his\
    \ vineyard. 3 And "
  '24': 'he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,  4
    And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will
    give you. And they went their way. 5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth
    hour, '
  '25': 'and did likewise.  6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
    standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? 7 They
    say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into
    the vineyard; and '
  '26': 'whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.  8 So when even was come, the
    lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them
    their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. 9 And when they came that
    were hired about the '
  '27': 'eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.  10 But when the first came,
    they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received
    every man a penny. 11 And when they had received it, they murmured against the
    goodman of the house, '
  '28': '12 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them
    equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.  13 But he answered
    one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me
    for a penny? 14 '
  '29': 'Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto
    thee.  15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye
    evil, because I am good? 16 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for
    many be called, '
  '30': 'but few chosen.  17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples
    apart in the way, and said unto them, 18 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the
    Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and
    they shall condemn '
  '31': 'him to death,  19 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge,
    and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again. 20 Then came to him
    the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a
    certain thing of '
  '32': 'him.  21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant
    that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the
    left, in thy kingdom. 22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask.
    Are ye able to drink of '
  '33': 'the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I
    am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.  23 And he saith unto them,
    Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized
    with: but to sit '
  '34': 'on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given
    to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.  24 And when the ten heard it, they
    were moved with indignation against the two brethren. 25 But Jesus called them
    unto him, and '
  '35': 'said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them,
    and they that are great exercise authority upon them.  26 But it shall not be
    so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
    27 And whosoever will '
  '36': 'be chief among you, let him be your servant:  28 Even as the Son of man came
    not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for
    many. 29 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. 30
    And, behold, two '
  '37': 'blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by,
    cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.  31 And the multitude
    rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying,
    Have mercy '
  '38': 'on us, O Lord, thou son of David.  32 And Jesus stood still, and called them,
    and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you? 33 They say unto him, Lord, that
    our eyes may be opened. 34 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their
    eyes: and '
  '39': 'immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him. '
  '40': "\nChapter 21\n And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage,\
    \ unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, 2 Saying unto them,\
    \ Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied,\
    \ and a colt with "
  '41': 'her: loose them, and bring them unto me.  3 And if any man say ought unto
    you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
    4 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
    saying, 5 Tell ye '
  '42': 'the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting
    upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.  6 And the disciples went, and did
    as Jesus commanded them, 7 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them
    their clothes, and they '
  '43': 'set him thereon.  8 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the
    way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way. 9 And
    the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to
    the son of David: '
  '44': 'Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.  10
    And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
    11 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. 12
    And Jesus went '
  '45': 'into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the
    temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that
    sold doves,  13 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the
    house of prayer; '
  '46': 'but ye have made it a den of thieves.  14 And the blind and the lame came
    to him in the temple; and he healed them. 15 And when the chief priests and scribes
    saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and
    saying, Hosanna '
  '47': 'to the son of David; they were sore displeased,  16 And said unto him, Hearest
    thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of
    the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? 17 And he left them,
    and went out '
  '48': 'of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.  18 Now in the morning as
    he returned into the city, he hungered. 19 And when he saw a fig tree in the way,
    he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let
    no fruit grow on '
  '49': 'thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.  20
    And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree
    withered away! 21 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If
    ye have faith, and '
  '50': 'doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also
    if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the
    sea; it shall be done. '

  '1': ' 22 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall
    receive. 23 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders
    of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest
    thou these '
  '2': 'things? and who gave thee this authority?  24 And Jesus answered and said
    unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise
    will tell you by what authority I do these things. 25 The baptism of John, whence
    was it? from heaven, '
  '3': 'or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
    heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?  26 But if we shall
    say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet. 27 And they answered
    Jesus, and '
  '4': 'said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority
    I do these things.  28 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came
    to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. 29 He answered and
    said, I will '
  '5': 'not: but afterward he repented, and went.  30 And he came to the second, and
    said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not. 31 Whether of
    them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith
    unto them, Verily '
  '6': 'I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of
    God before you.  32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
    believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when
    ye had seen it, '
  '7': 'repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.  33 Hear another parable:
    There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round
    about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen,
    and went into '
  '8': 'a far country:  34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
    to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. 35 And the husbandmen
    took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. 36 Again,
    he sent '
  '9': 'other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.  37 But
    last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. 38
    But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir;
    come, let us kill '
  '10': 'him, and let us seize on his inheritance.  39 And they caught him, and cast
    him out of the vineyard, and slew him. 40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard
    cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? 41 They say unto him, He will miserably
    destroy '
  '11': 'those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which
    shall render him the fruits in their seasons.  42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye
    never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same
    is become the head '
  '12': 'of the corner: this is the Lord''s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?  43
    Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given
    to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. 44 And whosoever shall fall on
    this stone shall '
  '13': 'be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.  45
    And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived
    that he spake of them. 46 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared
    the multitude, '
  '14': 'because they took him for a prophet. '
  '15': "\nChapter 22\n And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables,\
    \ and said, 2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a\
    \ marriage for his son, 3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden\
    \ to the wedding: and they "
  '16': 'would not come.  4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them
    which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are
    killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage. 5 But they made light
    of it, and went '
  '17': 'their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:  6 And the remnant
    took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. 7 But when the
    king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed
    those murderers, and '
  '18': 'burned up their city.  8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready,
    but they which were bidden were not worthy. 9 Go ye therefore into the highways,
    and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. 10 So those servants went out
    into the '
  '19': 'highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good:
    and the wedding was furnished with guests.  11 And when the king came in to see
    the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: 12 And he saith
    unto him, '
  '20': 'Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was
    speechless.  13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and
    take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing
    of teeth. 14 '
  '21': 'For many are called, but few are chosen.  15 Then went the Pharisees, and
    took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. 16 And they sent out unto
    him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art
    true, and teachest the '
  '22': 'way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest
    not the person of men.  17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful
    to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness,
    and said, Why tempt ye '
  '23': 'me, ye hypocrites?  19 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him
    a penny. 20 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? 21
    They say unto him, Caesar''s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar
    the things which '
  '24': 'are Caesar''s; and unto God the things that are God''s.  22 When they had
    heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way. 23 The same
    day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked
    him, 24 Saying, '
  '25': 'Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry
    his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  25 Now there were with us seven
    brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no
    issue, left his wife '
  '26': 'unto his brother:  26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
    27 And last of all the woman died also. 28 Therefore in the resurrection whose
    wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her. 29 Jesus answered and said
    unto them, Ye '
  '27': 'do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.  30 For in the
    resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels
    of God in heaven. 31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not
    read that which was '
  '28': 'spoken unto you by God, saying,  32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God
    of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
    33 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. 34
    But when the '
  '29': 'Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered
    together.  35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting
    him, and saying, 36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law? 37 Jesus
    said unto '
  '30': 'him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
    soul, and with all thy mind.  38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And
    the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 40 On these
    two commandments '
  '31': 'hang all the law and the prophets.  41 While the Pharisees were gathered
    together, Jesus asked them, 42 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he?
    They say unto him, The son of David. 43 He saith unto them, How then doth David
    in spirit call him '
  '32': 'Lord, saying,  44 The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
    till I make thine enemies thy footstool? 45 If David then call him Lord, how is
    he his son? 46 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man
    from that day forth ask '
  '33': 'him any more questions. '
  '34': "\nChapter 23\n Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 2\
    \ Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: 3 All therefore whatsoever\
    \ they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works:\
    \ for they say, and do "
  '35': 'not.  4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them
    on men''s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their
    fingers. 5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad
    their phylacteries, and '
  '36': 'enlarge the borders of their garments,  6 And love the uppermost rooms at
    feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, 7 And greetings in the markets,
    and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. 8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is
    your Master, even '
  '37': 'Christ; and all ye are brethren.  9 And call no man your father upon the
    earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. 10 Neither be ye called masters:
    for one is your Master, even Christ. 11 But he that is greatest among you shall
    be your servant. '
  '38': '12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble
    himself shall be exalted.  13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
    for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves,
    neither '
  '39': 'suffer ye them that are entering to go in.  14 Woe unto you, scribes and
    Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows'' houses, and for a pretence make
    long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. 15 Woe unto you,
    scribes and Pharisees, '
  '40': 'hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he
    is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.  16 Woe unto
    you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing;
    but whosoever '
  '41': 'shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!  17 Ye fools and blind:
    for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? 18
    And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth
    by the gift that is '
  '42': 'upon it, he is guilty.  19 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the
    gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? 20 Whoso therefore shall swear by
    the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon. 21 And whoso shall swear
    by the temple, '
  '43': 'sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.  22 And he that shall swear
    by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon. 23
    Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and
    anise and cummin, and '
  '44': 'have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith:
    these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.  24 Ye blind guides,
    which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. 25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, '
  '45': 'hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter,
    but within they are full of extortion and excess.  26 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse
    first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be
    clean also. 27 Woe '
  '46': 'unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited
    sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead

    unto men, but '
  '47': 'within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  29 Woe unto you, scribes and
    Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish
    the sepulchres of the righteous, 30 And say, If we had been in the days of our
    fathers, we would not '

    ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed
    the prophets. 32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. 33 Ye serpents,
    ye generation of vipers, '
  '49': 'how can ye escape the damnation of hell?  34 Wherefore, behold, I send unto
    you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify;
    and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from

    the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom
    ye slew between the temple and the altar. '

    as a hen '

    \ left here one "
  '4': 'stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.  3 And as he sat upon the
    mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when
    shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end
    of the world? 4 And '
  '5': 'Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.  5 For
    many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 6 And
    ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all
    these things must '
  '6': 'come to pass, but the end is not yet.  7 For nation shall rise against nation,
    and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and
    earthquakes, in divers places. 8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. 9 Then
    shall they deliver '
  '7': 'you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations
    for my name''s sake.  10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one
    another, and shall hate one another. 11 And many false prophets shall rise, and
    shall deceive '
  '8': 'many.  12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
    13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 14 And this
    gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all
    nations; and then '
  '9': 'shall the end come.  15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
    spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let
    him understand:) 16 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:
    17 Let him which '
  '10': 'is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:  18
    Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. 19 And
    woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! 20
    But pray ye that your '
  '11': 'flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:  21 For then shall
    be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this
    time, no, nor ever shall be. 22 And except those days should be shortened, there
    should no flesh be '
  '12': 'saved: but for the elect''s sake those days shall be shortened.  23 Then
    if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. 24
    For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great
    signs and wonders; '
  '13': 'insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.  25
    Behold, I have told you before. 26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold,
    he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe
    it not. 27 For as '
  '14': 'the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so

    there will the eagles be gathered together. 29 Immediately after the tribulation
    of those days shall '
  '15': 'the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars
    shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:  30 And
    then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the
    tribes of the earth '
  '16': 'mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with
    power and great glory.  31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of
    a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from
    one end of heaven to '
  '17': 'the other.  32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
    tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: 33 So likewise
    ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.

    as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying
    and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, 39 And knew
    not until the '
  '20': 'flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of

    this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would
    come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken
    up. 44 Therefore be '
  '22': 'ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.  45
    Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his
    household, to give them meat in due season? 46 Blessed is that servant, whom his
    lord when he '

    him ruler over all his goods. 48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his
    heart, My lord delayeth his coming; 49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants,
    and to eat and '

    when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, 51 And shall

  '26': "\nChapter 25\n Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,\

    the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 6 And at midnight there
    was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. 7 Then all
    those virgins arose, '
  '28': 'and trimmed their lamps.  8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of
    your oil; for our lamps are gone out. 9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so;
    lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and
    buy for yourselves. '
  '29': '10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready
    went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.  11 Afterward came also
    the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 12 But he answered and said,
    Verily I say unto '
  '30': 'you, I know you not.  13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor
    the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. 14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man
    travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto
    them his goods. 15 '
  '31': 'And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to
    every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.  16

    two. 18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his
    lord''s money. 19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth
    with them. 20 And '
  '33': 'so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents,
    saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside
    them five talents more.  21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
    servant: thou '
  '34': 'hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things:
    enter thou into the joy of thy lord.  22 He also that had received two talents
    came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained
    two other '
  '35': 'talents beside them.  23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful
    servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
    many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 24 Then he which had received
    the one talent '
  '36': 'came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where
    thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:  25 And I was afraid,
    and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. 26
    His lord '
  '37': 'answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest
    that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:  27 Thou oughtest
    therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should
    have received '
  '38': 'mine own with usury.  28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it
    unto him which hath ten talents. 29 For unto every one that hath shall be given,
    and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even
    that which he hath. '
  '39': '30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall
    be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory,
    and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
    32 And before him '
  '40': 'shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another,
    as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:  33 And he shall set the sheep
    on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 34 Then shall the King say unto
    them on his right '
  '41': 'hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
    from the foundation of the world:  35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat:
    I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 36 Naked,
    and ye clothed '
  '42': 'me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.  37
    Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred,

    and took thee in? '
  '43': 'or naked, and clothed thee?  39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and
    came unto thee? 40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto
    you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye
    have done it unto '
  '44': 'me.  41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me,
    ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 42 For
    I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
    43 I was a '
  '45': 'stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and
    in prison, and ye visited me not.  44 Then shall they also answer him, saying,
    Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,
    or in prison, and did '
  '46': 'not minister unto thee?  45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say
    unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not
    to me. 46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous
    into life eternal.'

    be an uproar '

    the leper, 7 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious
    ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. 8 But when his disciples
    saw it, they had '

    covenanted with him '

  '8': 'And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye

    for the remission of sins. 29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth
    of this fruit of the '
  '9': 'vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father''s kingdom.  30
    And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. 31 Then
    saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for
    it is written, I '
  '10': 'will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.  32
    But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. 33 Peter answered

    before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 35 Peter said unto him, Though
    I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.

    disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.  37 And he took with him Peter

    saith he unto them, '
  '13': 'My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch
    with me.  39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying,
    O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as
    I will, but as '
  '14': 'thou wilt.  40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep,

    pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the
    flesh is weak. 42 He '

    cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.  43 And he

    and went away again, '
  '16': 'and prayed the third time, saying the same words.  45 Then cometh he to his
    disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the
    hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46
    Rise, let us be going: '

    staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 48 Now he that betrayed
    him gave them a '

    And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. 50 And
    Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid
    hands on Jesus and '
  '19': 'took him.  51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
    his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest''s, and
    smote off his ear. 52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his
    place: for all they '
  '20': 'that take the sword shall perish with the sword.  53 Thinkest thou that I

    prophets might '

    scribes and the elders were assembled. 58 But Peter followed him afar off unto
    the high priest''s '
  '23': 'palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.  59 Now the
    chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus,
    to put him to death; 60 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came,
    yet found they '
  '24': 'none. At the last came two false witnesses,  61 And said, This fellow said,
    I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. 62 And
    the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which
    these witness '
  '25': 'against thee?  63 But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered
    and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether
    thou be the Christ, the Son of God. 64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless
    I say unto '
  '26': 'you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power,
    and coming in the clouds of heaven.  65 Then the high priest rent his clothes,
    saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold,
    now ye have '
  '27': 'heard his blasphemy.  66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty
    of death. 67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote
    him with the palms of their hands, 68 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who
    is he that smote '
  '28': 'thee?  69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him,
    saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. 70 But he denied before them all,
    saying, I know not what thou sayest. 71 And when he was gone out into the porch,
    another maid saw '
  '29': 'him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus
    of Nazareth.  72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. 73 And
    after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou
    also art one of them; '
  '30': 'for thy speech bewrayeth thee.  74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying,
    I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. 75 And Peter remembered the
    word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
    And he went '
  '31': 'out, and wept bitterly. '
  '32': "\nChapter 27\n When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders\
    \ of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 2 And when they\
    \ had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.\
    \ 3 Then Judas, which "
  '33': 'had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and
    brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,  4
    Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said,
    What is that to us? '
  '34': 'see thou to that.  5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple,
    and departed, and went and hanged himself. 6 And the chief priests took the silver
    pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because
    it is the price of '
  '35': 'blood.  7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter''s field,
    to bury strangers in. 8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto
    this day. 9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
    And they took '
  '36': 'the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they
    of the children of Israel did value;  10 And gave them for the potter''s field,
    as the Lord appointed me. 11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor
    asked him, saying, '
  '37': 'Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.  12
    And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
    13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against
    thee? 14 And he '
  '38': 'answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.  15
    Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner,
    whom they would. 16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. 17
    Therefore when '
  '39': 'they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release
    unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?  18 For he knew that for
    envy they had delivered him. 19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his
    wife sent unto '
  '40': 'him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered
    many things this day in a dream because of him.  20 But the chief priests and
    elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
    21 The governor '
  '41': 'answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release
    unto you? They said, Barabbas.  22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then
    with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
    23 And the governor '
  '42': 'said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let
    him be crucified.  24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that
    rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude,
    saying, I am '
  '43': 'innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.  25 Then answered
    all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. 26 Then released
    he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be
    crucified. 27 Then '
  '44': 'the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered
    unto him the whole band of soldiers.  28 And they stripped him, and put on him
    a scarlet robe. 29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
    his head, and a reed '
  '45': 'in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying,
    Hail, King of the Jews!  30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote
    him on the head. 31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off
    from him, and '
  '46': 'put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.  32 And as they
    came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear
    his cross. 33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to
    say, a place of a '
  '47': 'skull,  34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he
    had tasted thereof, he would not drink. 35 And they crucified him, and parted
    his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
    prophet, They parted my '
  '48': 'garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.  36 And sitting
    down they watched him there; 37 And set up over his head his accusation written,
    This Is Jesus The King Of The Jews. 38 Then were there two thieves crucified with
    him, one on the '
  '49': 'right hand, and another on the left.  39 And they that passed by reviled
    him, wagging their heads, 40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and
    buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down
    from the cross. 41 '
  '50': Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,  42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.

  '1': ' 43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he
    said, I am the Son of God. 44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him,
    cast the same in his teeth. 45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over
    all the land unto the '
  '2': ninth hour.  46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.
  '3': ' 48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with
    vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. 49 The rest said, Let be,
    let us see whether Elias will come to save him. 50 Jesus, when he had cried again
    with a loud voice, '
  '4': 'yielded up the ghost.  51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in
    twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
    52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
    53 And came out of the '
  '5': 'graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto
    many.  54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus,
    saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying,
    Truly this was '
  '6': 'the Son of God.  55 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed
    Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: 56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and
    Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children. 57 When
    the even was '
  '7': 'come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself
    was Jesus'' disciple:  58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then
    Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. 59 And when Joseph had taken the body,
    he wrapped it in a '
  '8': 'clean linen cloth,  60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn
    out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and
    departed. 61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against
    the sepulchre. 62 '
  '9': 'Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests
    and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,  63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that
    deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. 64
    Command therefore '
  '10': 'that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come
    by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead:
    so the last error shall be worse than the first.  65 Pilate said unto them, Ye
    have a watch: go '
  '11': your way, make it as sure as ye can.  66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
  '12': "\nChapter 28\n In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the\
    \ first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.\
    \ 2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended\
    \ from heaven, and "
  '13': 'came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.  3 His countenance
    was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 4 And for fear of him the keepers
    did shake, and became as dead men. 5 And the angel answered and said unto the
    women, '
  '14': 'Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.  6 He is
    not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
    7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and,
    behold, he goeth before '
  '15': 'you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.  8 And they
    departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring
    his disciples word. 9 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met
    them, saying, All '
  '16': 'hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.  10 Then
    said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee,
    and there shall they see me. 11 Now when they were going, behold, some of the
    watch came into '
  '17': 'the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.  12
    And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave
    large money unto the soldiers, 13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night,
    and stole him away '
  '18': 'while we slept.  14 And if this come to the governor''s ears, we will persuade
    him, and secure you. 15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and
    this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. 16 Then the eleven
    disciples '
  '19': 'went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.  17
    And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. 18 And Jesus came
    and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
    19 Go ye therefore, '
  '20': 'and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
    Son, and of the Holy Ghost:  20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
    I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the

MarkBook1:
  '1': "Chapter 1\n The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; 2\
    \ As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,\
    \ which shall prepare thy way before thee. 3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness,\
    \ Prepare ye the "
  '2': 'way of the Lord, make his paths straight.  4 John did baptize in the wilderness,
    and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 5 And there went
    out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized
    of him in '
  '3': 'the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.  6 And John was clothed with camel''s
    hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and
    wild honey; 7 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me,
    the latchet of '
  '4': 'whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.  8 I indeed have baptized
    you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 9 And it came to
    pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized
    of John in '
  '5': 'Jordan.  10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
    opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 11 And there came a voice
    from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 12 And
    immediately the '
  '6': 'spirit driveth him into the wilderness.  13 And he was there in the wilderness
    forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered
    unto him. 14 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching
    the '
  '7': 'gospel of the kingdom of God,  15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the
    kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. 16 Now as he walked
    by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into
    the sea: for they '
  '8': 'were fishers.  17 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make
    you to become fishers of men. 18 And straightway they forsook their nets, and
    followed him. 19 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the
    son of Zebedee, and '
  '9': 'John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.  20 And straightway
    he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired
    servants, and went after him. 21 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway
    on the sabbath '
  '10': 'day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.  22 And they were astonished
    at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the
    scribes. 23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and
    he cried out, 24 '
  '11': 'Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?
    art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.  25
    And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. 26 And when
    the unclean spirit '
  '12': 'had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.  27 And they
    were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What
    thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even
    the unclean spirits, '
  '13': 'and they do obey him.  28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout
    all the region round about Galilee. 29 And forthwith, when they were come out
    of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James
    and John. 30 But '
  '14': 'Simon''s wife''s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.  31
    And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever
    left her, and she ministered unto them. 32 And at even, when the sun did set,
    they brought '
  '15': 'unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.  33
    And all the city was gathered together at the door. 34 And he healed many that
    were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils
    to speak, '
  '16': 'because they knew him.  35 And in the morning, rising up a great while before
    day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. 36 And
    Simon and they that were with him followed after him. 37 And when they had found
    him, they said '
  '17': 'unto him, All men seek for thee.  38 And he said unto them, Let us go into
    the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. 39 And
    he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. 40
    And there came a '
  '18': 'leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him,
    If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  41 And Jesus, moved with compassion,
    put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.
    42 And as soon as he '
  '19': 'had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.  43
    And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 44 And saith unto him,
    See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and
    offer for thy '
  '20': 'cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.  45
    But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter,
    insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without
    in desert places: and '
  '21': 'they came to him from every quarter. '
  '22': "\nChapter 2\n And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it\
    \ was noised that he was in the house. 2 And straightway many were gathered together,\
    \ insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the\
    \ door: and he preached "
  '23': 'the word unto them.  3 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy,
    which was borne of four. 4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the
    press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they
    let down the bed '
  '24': 'wherein the sick of the palsy lay.  5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said
    unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. 6 But there was certain
    of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, 7 Why doth this man
    thus speak '
  '25': 'blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?  8 And immediately when Jesus
    perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto
    them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? 9 Whether is it easier to say
    to the sick of the '
  '26': 'palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed,
    and walk?  10 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to
    forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) 11 I say unto thee, Arise,
    and take up thy bed, and '
  '27': 'go thy way into thine house.  12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed,
    and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified
    God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. 13 And he went forth again by the
    sea side; and all '
  '28': 'the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.  14 And as he passed
    by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said
    unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him. 15 And it came to pass, that,
    as Jesus sat at meat '
  '29': 'in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and
    his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.  16 And when the scribes
    and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples,
    How is it '
  '30': 'that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?  17 When Jesus heard
    it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but
    they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
    18 And the '
  '31': 'disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say
    unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples
    fast not?  19 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast,
    while the '
  '32': 'bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they
    cannot fast.  20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
    from them, and then shall they fast in those days. 21 No man also seweth a piece
    of new cloth on '
  '33': 'an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the
    old, and the rent is made worse.  22 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles:
    else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles
    will be marred: '
  '34': 'but new wine must be put into new bottles.  23 And it came to pass, that
    he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as
    they went, to pluck the ears of corn. 24 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold,
    why do they on the '
  '35': 'sabbath day that which is not lawful?  25 And he said unto them, Have ye
    never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they
    that were with him? 26 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar
    the high priest, and '
  '36': 'did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and
    gave also to them which were with him?  27 And he said unto them, The sabbath
    was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: 28 Therefore the Son of man is
    Lord also of the sabbath.'
  '37': "\nChapter 3\n And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man\
    \ there which had a withered hand. 2 And they watched him, whether he would heal\
    \ him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him. 3 And he saith unto the\
    \ man which had the withered "
  '38': 'hand, Stand forth.  4 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on
    the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their
    peace. 5 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved
    for the hardness of their '
  '39': 'hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched
    it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.  6 And the Pharisees went
    forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might
    destroy him. 7 But '
  '40': 'Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude
    from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,  8 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea,
    and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when
    they had heard '
  '41': 'what great things he did, came unto him.  9 And he spake to his disciples,
    that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should
    throng him. 10 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for
    to touch him, as many '
  '42': 'as had plagues.  11 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before
    him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 12 And he straitly charged them
    that they should not make him known. 13 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth
    unto him '
  '43': 'whom he would: and they came unto him.  14 And he ordained twelve, that they
    should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, 15 And to have
    power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils: 16 And Simon he surnamed Peter;
    17 And James the '
  '44': 'son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges,
    which is, The sons of thunder:  18 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and
    Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the
    Canaanite, 19 '
  '45': 'And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.  20
    And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat
    bread. 21 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him:
    for they said, He is '
  '46': 'beside himself.  22 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said,
    He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils. 23 And
    he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out
    Satan? 24 And if a '
  '47': 'kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.  25 And if
    a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 26 And if Satan rise
    up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. 27 No man
    can enter into a '
  '48': 'strong man''s house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong
    man; and then he will spoil his house.  28 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall
    be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall
    blaspheme: 29 But '
  '49': 'he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but
    is in danger of eternal damnation.  30 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
    31 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto
    him, calling '
  '50': him.  32 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. 33 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?

    and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. 5 And some fell on stony ground,
    where it had '
  '4': 'not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:  6
    But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered
    away. 7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and
    it yielded '

    up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an

    That seeing they may '
  '7': 'see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest
    at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.  13
    And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all
    parables? 14 The '
  '8': 'sower soweth the word.  15 And these are they by the way side, where the word
    is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the
    word that was sown in their hearts. 16 And these are they likewise which are sown
    on stony '
  '9': 'ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;  17
    And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when
    affliction or persecution ariseth for the word''s sake, immediately they are offended.

  '13': 'ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be
    given.  25 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from
    him shall be taken even that which he hath. 26 And he said, So is the kingdom
    of God, as if a man '
  '14': 'should cast seed into the ground;  27 And should sleep, and rise night and
    day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. 28 For the earth
    bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the
    full corn in the '
  '15': 'ear.  29 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the
    sickle, because the harvest is come. 30 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken
    the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? 31 It is like
    a grain of mustard '
  '16': 'seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that
    be in the earth:  32 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater
    than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air
    may lodge under the '
  '17': 'shadow of it.  33 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them,
    as they were able to hear it. 34 But without a parable spake he not unto them:
    and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples. 35 And the
    same day, when the '
  '18': 'even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.  36
    And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the
    ship. And there were also with him other little ships. 37 And there arose a great
    storm of wind, '
  '19': 'and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.  38 And he was
    in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say
    unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? 39 And he arose, and rebuked
    the wind, and said '
  '20': 'unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great
    calm.  40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have
    no faith? 41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner
    of man is this, that '
  '21': 'even the wind and the sea obey him? '
  '22': "\nChapter 5\n And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the\
    \ country of the Gadarenes. 2 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately\
    \ there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 3 Who had his dwelling\
    \ among the tombs; and "
  '23': 'no man could bind him, no, not with chains:  4 Because that he had been often
    bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him,
    and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. 5 And always,
    night and day, he '
  '24': 'was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with
    stones.  6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 7 And cried
    with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the
    most high God? I '
  '25': 'adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.  8 For he said unto him, Come
    out of the man, thou unclean spirit. 9 And he asked him, What is thy name? And
    he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. 10 And he besought him
    much that he would '
  '26': 'not send them away out of the country.  11 Now there was there nigh unto
    the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. 12 And all the devils besought him,
    saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 13 And forthwith
    Jesus gave them leave. '
  '27': 'And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd
    ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;)
    and were choked in the sea.  14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it
    in the city, and in the '
  '28': 'country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.  15 And they
    come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion,
    sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 16 And they
    that saw it told '
  '29': 'them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning
    the swine.  17 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. 18 And
    when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed
    him that he '
  '30': 'might be with him.  19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him,
    Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for
    thee, and hath had compassion on thee. 20 And he departed, and began to publish
    in Decapolis how great '
  '31': 'things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.  21 And when Jesus
    was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him:
    and he was nigh unto the sea. 22 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of
    the synagogue, '
  '32': 'Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,  23 And besought
    him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee,
    come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live. 24
    And Jesus went with '
  '33': 'him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.  25 And a certain woman,
    which had an issue of blood twelve years, 26 And had suffered many things of many
    physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather
    grew worse, 27 '
  '34': 'When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.  28
    For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. 29 And straightway
    the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was
    healed of '
  '35': 'that plague.  30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had
    gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?
    31 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and
    sayest thou, Who '
  '36': 'touched me?  32 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
    33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and
    fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 34 And he said unto her, Daughter,
    thy faith '
  '37': 'hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.  35 While
    he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue''s house certain which
    said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further? 36 As soon
    as Jesus heard the '
  '38': 'word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid,
    only believe.  37 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James,
    and John the brother of James. 38 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the
    synagogue, and '
  '39': 'seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.  39 And when he
    was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is
    not dead, but sleepeth. 40 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put
    them all out, he taketh '
  '40': 'the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and
    entereth in where the damsel was lying.  41 And he took the damsel by the hand,
    and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto
    thee, arise. 42 And '
  '41': straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.  43 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
  '42': "\nChapter 6\n And he went out from thence, and came into his own country;\
    \ and his disciples follow him. 2 And when the sabbath day was come, he began\
    \ to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From\
    \ whence hath this man these "
  '43': 'things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty
    works are wrought by his hands?  3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary,
    the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters
    here with us? '
  '44': 'And they were offended at him.  4 But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is
    not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his
    own house. 5 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands
    upon a few sick folk, '
  '45': 'and healed them.  6 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went
    round about the villages, teaching. 7 And he called unto him the twelve, and began
    to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; 8
    And commanded '
  '46': 'them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only;
    no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:  9 But be shod with sandals; and
    not put on two coats. 10 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter
    into an house, there abide '
  '47': 'till ye depart from that place.  11 And whosoever shall not receive you,
    nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a
    testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for
    Sodom and Gomorrha in the '
  '48': 'day of judgment, than for that city.  12 And they went out, and preached
    that men should repent. 13 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil
    many that were sick, and healed them. 14 And king Herod heard of him; (for his
    name was spread '
  '49': 'abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and
    therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.  15 Others said, That
    it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
    16 But when Herod heard '
  '50': 'thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.  17
    For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison
    for Herodias'' sake, his brother Philip''s wife: for he had married her.'

  '1': ' 18 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother''s
    wife. 19 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him;
    but she could not: 20 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and
    an holy, '
  '2': 'and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him
    gladly.  21 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made
    a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee; 22 And when
    the daughter of the '
  '3': 'said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with
    him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will
    give it thee.  23 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will
    give it thee, unto '
  '4': 'the half of my kingdom.  24 And she went forth, and said unto her mother,
    What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. 25 And she came
    in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give
    me by and by in a '
  '5': 'charger the head of John the Baptist.  26 And the king was exceeding sorry;
    yet for his oath''s sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not
    reject her. 27 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his
    head to be brought: '
  '6': 'and he went and beheaded him in the prison,  28 And brought his head in a
    charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. 29 And
    when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it
    in a tomb. 30 And the '
  '7': 'apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things,
    both what they had done, and what they had taught.  31 And he said unto them,
    Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were
    many coming and going, '
  '8': 'and they had no leisure so much as to eat.  32 And they departed into a desert
    place by ship privately. 33 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him,
    and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto
    him. 34 And '
  '9': 'Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward
    them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach
    them many things.  35 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto
    him, and said, '
  '10': 'This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:  36 Send them away,
    that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy
    themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat. 37 He answered and said unto them,
    Give ye them to '
  '11': 'eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of
    bread, and give them to eat?  38 He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye?
    go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. 39 And he commanded
    them to make all '
  '12': 'sit down by companies upon the green grass.  40 And they sat down in ranks,
    by hundreds, and by fifties. 41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the
    two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave
    them to his disciples '
  '13': 'to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.  42 And
    they did all eat, and were filled. 43 And they took up twelve baskets full of
    the fragments, and of the fishes. 44 And they that did eat of the loaves were
    about five thousand men. '
  '14': '45 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and
    to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.  46
    And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray. 47 And when
    even was come, the '
  '15': 'ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.  48 And he saw
    them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth
    watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed
    by them. 49 '
  '16': 'But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit,
    and cried out:  50 For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he
    talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
    51 And he went '
  '17': 'up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed
    in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.  52 For they considered not the miracle
    of the loaves: for their heart was hardened. 53 And when they had passed over,
    they came into '
  '18': 'the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.  54 And when they were come
    out of the ship, straightway they knew him, 55 And ran through that whole region
    round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they
    heard he was. 56 And '
  '19': 'whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid
    the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but
    the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole. '
  '20': "\nChapter 7\n Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the\
    \ scribes, which came from Jerusalem. 2 And when they saw some of his disciples\
    \ eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.\
    \ 3 For the Pharisees, "
  '21': 'and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the
    tradition of the elders.  4 And when they come from the market, except they wash,
    they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold,
    as the washing of '
  '22': 'cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.  5 Then the Pharisees and
    scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the
    elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? 6 He answered and said unto them, Well
    hath Esaias '
  '23': 'prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me
    with their lips, but their heart is far from me.  7 Howbeit in vain do they worship
    me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. 8 For laying aside the commandment
    of God, ye '
  '24': 'hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other
    such like things ye do.  9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment
    of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. 10 For Moses said, Honour thy father
    and thy '
  '25': 'mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:  11 But
    ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say,
    a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free. 12 And
    ye suffer him no '
  '26': 'more to do ought for his father or his mother;  13 Making the word of God
    of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such
    like things do ye. 14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said
    unto them, Hearken unto '
  '27': 'me every one of you, and understand:  15 There is nothing from without a
    man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him,
    those are they that defile the man. 16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
    17 And when he '
  '28': 'was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning
    the parable.  18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also?
    Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man,
    it cannot defile '
  '29': 'him;  19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and
    goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? 20 And he said, That which cometh
    out of the man, that defileth the man. 21 For from within, out of the heart of
    men, proceed evil '
  '30': 'thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,  22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness,
    deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: 23 All these
    evil things come from within, and defile the man. 24 And from thence he arose,
    and went '
  '31': 'into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would
    have no man know it: but he could not be hid.  25 For a certain woman, whose young
    daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: 26
    The woman was a '
  '32': 'Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast
    forth the devil out of her daughter.  27 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children
    first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children''s bread, and to cast
    it unto the dogs. 28 '
  '33': 'And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table
    eat of the children''s crumbs.  29 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy
    way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter. 30 And when she was come to her house,
    she found the '
  '34': 'devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.  31 And again, departing
    from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the
    midst of the coasts of Decapolis. 32 And they bring unto him one that was deaf,
    and had an '
  '35': 'impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.  33
    And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and
    he spit, and touched his tongue; 34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith
    unto him, '
  '36': 'Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.  35 And straightway his ears were opened,
    and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. 36 And he charged
    them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more
    a great deal they '
  '37': 'published it;  37 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done
    all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.'
  '38': "\nChapter 8\n In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing\
    \ to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, 2 I have compassion\
    \ on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing\
    \ to eat: 3 "
  '39': 'And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the
    way: for divers of them came from far.  4 And his disciples answered him, From
    whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness? 5 And he
    asked them, How many '
  '40': 'loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.  6 And he commanded the people to sit
    down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake,
    and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the
    people. 7 And they had '
  '41': 'a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before
    them.  8 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat
    that was left seven baskets. 9 And they that had eaten were about four thousand:
    and he sent them away.'
  '42': ' 10 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into
    the parts of Dalmanutha. 11 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question
    with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. 12 And he sighed deeply
    in his spirit, '
  '43': 'and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto
    you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.  13 And he left them,
    and entering into the ship again departed to the other side. 14 Now the disciples
    had forgotten to take '
  '44': 'bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.  15 And
    he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and
    of the leaven of Herod. 16 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because
    we have no bread. '
  '45': '17 And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye
    have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet
    hardened?  18 Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye
    not remember? 19 When I '
  '46': 'brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments
    took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.  20 And when the seven among four thousand,
    how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. 21 And he
    said unto them, '
  '47': 'How is it that ye do not understand?  22 And he cometh to Bethsaida; and
    they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him. 23 And he took
    the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on
    his eyes, and put his '
  '48': 'hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.  24 And he looked up, and said,
    I see men as trees, walking. 25 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes,
    and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. 26 And he
    sent him away to '
  '49': 'his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.  27
    And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and
    by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?
    28 And they '
  '50': answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.  29 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.

    glory of his Father with the holy angels. '
  '6': "\nChapter 9\n And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be\
    \ some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have\
    \ seen the kingdom of God come with power. 2 And after six days Jesus taketh with\
    \ him Peter, and James, and "
  '7': 'John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he
    was transfigured before them.  3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white
    as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them. 4 And there appeared unto them
    Elias with Moses: '
  '8': 'and they were talking with Jesus.  5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus,
    Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for
    thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. 6 For he wist not what to say; for
    they were sore '
  '9': 'afraid.  7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came
    out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 8 And suddenly, when
    they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
    9 And as '
  '10': 'they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no
    man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.  10
    And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the
    rising from the '
  '11': 'dead should mean.  11 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that
    Elias must first come? 12 And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first,
    and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must
    suffer many '
  '12': 'things, and be set at nought.  13 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed
    come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of
    him. 14 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them,
    and the scribes '
  '13': 'questioning with them.  15 And straightway all the people, when they beheld
    him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him. 16 And he asked the
    scribes, What question ye with them? 17 And one of the multitude answered and
    said, Master, I have '
  '14': 'brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;  18 And wheresoever he
    taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth
    away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could
    not. 19 He '
  '15': 'answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with
    you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.  20 And they brought him
    unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on
    the ground, and '
  '16': 'wallowed foaming.  21 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this
    came unto him? And he said, Of a child. 22 And ofttimes it hath cast him into
    the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing,
    have compassion on '
  '17': 'us, and help us.  23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things
    are possible to him that believeth. 24 And straightway the father of the child
    cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. 25 When
    Jesus saw that the '
  '18': 'people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him,
    Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into
    him.  26 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he
    was as one dead; '
  '19': 'insomuch that many said, He is dead.  27 But Jesus took him by the hand,
    and lifted him up; and he arose. 28 And when he was come into the house, his disciples
    asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out? 29 And he said unto them,
    This kind can '
  '20': 'come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.  30 And they departed thence,
    and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it. 31 For
    he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into
    the hands of '
  '21': 'men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise
    the third day.  32 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask
    him. 33 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was
    it that ye disputed '
  '22': 'among yourselves by the way?  34 But they held their peace: for by the way
    they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest. 35 And he sat
    down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first,
    the same shall be '
  '23': 'last of all, and servant of all.  36 And he took a child, and set him in
    the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them, 37
    Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever
    shall receive me, '
  '24': 'receiveth not me, but him that sent me.  38 And John answered him, saying,
    Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and
    we forbad him, because he followeth not us. 39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not:
    for there is no man '
  '25': 'which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.  40
    For he that is not against us is on our part. 41 For whosoever shall give you
    a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say
    unto you, he shall not '
  '26': 'lose his reward.  42 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones
    that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
    neck, and he were cast into the sea. 43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off:
    it is better for thee '
  '27': 'to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the
    fire that never shall be quenched:  44 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire
    is not quenched. 45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for
    thee to enter halt '
  '28': 'into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that
    never shall be quenched:  46 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
    47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter
    into the kingdom '
  '29': 'of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:  48
    Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 49 For every one shall
    be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. 50 Salt is
    good: but if the salt '
  '30': 'have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves,
    and have peace one with another. '
  '31': "\nChapter 10\n And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea\
    \ by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as\
    \ he was wont, he taught them again. 2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked\
    \ him, Is it lawful for a "
  '32': 'man to put away his wife? tempting him.  3 And he answered and said unto
    them, What did Moses command you? 4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill
    of divorcement, and to put her away. 5 And Jesus answered and said unto them,
    For the hardness of '
  '33': 'your heart he wrote you this precept.  6 But from the beginning of the creation
    God made them male and female. 7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and
    mother, and cleave to his wife; 8 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they
    are no more '
  '34': 'twain, but one flesh.  9 What therefore God hath joined together, let not
    man put asunder. 10 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
    matter. 11 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry
    another, committeth '
  '35': 'adultery against her.  12 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and
    be married to another, she committeth adultery. 13 And they brought young children
    to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought
    them. 14 But when '
  '36': 'Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little
    children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.  15
    Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little
    child, he '
  '37': 'shall not enter therein.  16 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands
    upon them, and blessed them. 17 And when he was gone forth into the way, there
    came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I
    do that I may inherit '
  '38': 'eternal life?  18 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there
    is none good but one, that is, God. 19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit
    adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour
    thy father '
  '39': 'and mother.  20 And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have
    I observed from my youth. 21 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto
    him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to
    the poor, and thou '
  '40': 'shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.  22
    And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
    23 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall
    they that '
  '41': 'have riches enter into the kingdom of God!  24 And the disciples were astonished
    at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard
    is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! 25 It is
    easier for a '
  '42': 'camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into
    the kingdom of God.  26 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among
    themselves, Who then can be saved? 27 And Jesus looking upon them saith, With
    men it is impossible, '
  '43': 'but not with God: for with God all things are possible.  28 Then Peter began
    to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. 29 And Jesus answered
    and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren,
    or '
  '44': 'sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake,
    and the gospel''s,  30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
    and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions;
    and in the '
  '45': 'world to come eternal life.  31 But many that are first shall be last; and
    the last first. 32 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
    before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And
    he took again the '
  '46': 'twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,  33 Saying,
    Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the
    chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and
    shall deliver him to '
  '47': 'the Gentiles:  34 And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall
    spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. 35 And
    James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that
    thou shouldest '
  '48': 'do for us whatsoever we shall desire.  36 And he said unto them, What would
    ye that I should do for you? 37 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may
    sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. 38 But
    Jesus said unto '
  '49': 'them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and
    be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?  39 And they said unto him,
    We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink
    of; and with the '
  '50': 'baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:  40 But to sit on
    my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to
    them for whom it is prepared.'

  '1': ' 41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James
    and John. 42 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they
    which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and
    their great ones '
  '2': 'exercise authority upon them.  43 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever
    will be great among you, shall be your minister: 44 And whosoever of you will
    be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. 45 For even the Son of man came not
    to be ministered '
  '3': 'unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.  46 And they
    came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great
    number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side
    begging. 47 And when '
  '4': 'he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus,
    thou son of David, have mercy on me.  48 And many charged him that he should hold
    his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on
    me. 49 And Jesus '
  '5': 'stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man,
    saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.  50 And he, casting
    away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. 51 And Jesus answered and said unto
    him, What wilt thou '
  '6': that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.  52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
  '7': "\nChapter 11\n And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany,\
    \ at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, 2 And saith unto\
    \ them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered\
    \ into it, ye "
  '8': 'shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.  3
    And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of
    him; and straightway he will send him hither. 4 And they went their way, and found
    the colt tied by '
  '9': 'the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.  5 And
    certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
    6 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go. 7
    And they brought the '
  '10': 'colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.  8 And
    many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees,
    and strawed them in the way. 9 And they that went before, and they that followed,
    cried, saying, '
  '11': 'Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:  10 Blessed be
    the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna
    in the highest. 11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and
    when he had looked round '
  '12': 'about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany
    with the twelve.  12 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was
    hungry: 13 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he
    might find any '
  '13': 'thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the
    time of figs was not yet.  14 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat
    fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it. 15 And they come
    to Jerusalem: and '
  '14': 'Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought
    in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of
    them that sold doves;  16 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel
    through the '
  '15': 'temple.  17 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house
    shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den
    of thieves. 18 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they
    might destroy him: for '
  '16': 'they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.  19
    And when even was come, he went out of the city. 20 And in the morning, as they
    passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. 21 And Peter calling
    to remembrance saith '
  '17': 'unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.  22
    And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. 23 For verily I say unto
    you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou
    cast into the '
  '18': 'sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things
    which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.  24 Therefore
    I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive
    them, and ye '
  '19': 'shall have them.  25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought
    against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
    26 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive
    your '
  '20': 'trespasses.  27 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in
    the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
    28 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee
    this authority '
  '21': 'to do these things?  29 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also
    ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority
    I do these things. 30 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer
    me. 31 And they '
  '22': 'reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say,
    Why then did ye not believe him?  32 But if we shall say, Of men; they feared
    the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed. 33 And they
    answered and said '
  '23': 'unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither
    do I tell you by what authority I do these things. '
  '24': "\nChapter 12\n And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man\
    \ planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat,\
    \ and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.\
    \ 2 And at the season he "
  '25': 'sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen
    of the fruit of the vineyard.  3 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him
    away empty. 4 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast
    stones, and '
  '26': 'wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.  5 And again
    he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing
    some. 6 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto
    them, saying, '
  '27': 'They will reverence my son.  7 But those husbandmen said among themselves,
    This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.''
    8 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. 9 What
    shall therefore the lord '
  '28': 'of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give
    the vineyard unto others.  10 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which
    the builders rejected is become the head of the corner: 11 This was the Lord''s
    doing, and it is '
  '29': 'marvellous in our eyes?  12 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared
    the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they
    left him, and went their way. 13 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees
    and of the '
  '30': 'Herodians, to catch him in his words.  14 And when they were come, they say
    unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou
    regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful
    to give tribute '
  '31': 'to Caesar, or not?  15 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing
    their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may
    see it. 16 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
    superscription? And '
  '32': 'they said unto him, Caesar''s.  17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render
    to Caesar the things that are Caesar''s, and to God the things that are God''s.
    And they marvelled at him. 18 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there
    is no resurrection; '
  '33': 'and they asked him, saying,  19 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man''s
    brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother
    should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 20 Now there were seven
    brethren: and the '
  '34': 'first took a wife, and dying left no seed.  21 And the second took her, and
    died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. 22 And the seven had her,
    and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. 23 In the resurrection therefore,
    when they '
  '35': 'shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.  24
    And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not
    the scriptures, neither the power of God? 25 For when they shall rise from the
    dead, they '
  '36': 'neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are
    in heaven.  26 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the
    book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham,
    and the God of '
  '37': 'Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  27 He is not the God of the dead, but the God
    of the living: ye therefore do greatly err. 28 And one of the scribes came, and
    having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them
    well, asked him, '
  '38': 'Which is the first commandment of all?  29 And Jesus answered him, The first
    of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: 30 And
    thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
    with all thy '
  '39': 'mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.  31 And the
    second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is
    none other commandment greater than these. 32 And the scribe said unto him, Well,
    Master, thou hast '
  '40': 'said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:  33
    And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all
    the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is
    more than all whole '
  '41': 'burnt offerings and sacrifices.  34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly,
    he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that
    durst ask him any question. 35 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in
    the '
  '42': 'temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?  36 For David
    himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right
    hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool. 37 David therefore himself calleth
    him Lord; and '
  '43': 'whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.  38 And
    he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in
    long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces, 39 And the chief seats
    in the synagogues, and '
  '44': 'the uppermost rooms at feasts:  40 Which devour widows'' houses, and for
    a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. 41 And Jesus
    sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury:
    and many that '
  '45': 'were rich cast in much.  42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she
    threw in two mites, which make a farthing. 43 And he called unto him his disciples,
    and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more
    in, than all they '
  '46': 'which have cast into the treasury:  44 For all they did cast in of their
    abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.'
  '47': "\nChapter 13\n And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith\
    \ unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here! 2 And\
    \ Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall\
    \ not be left one stone "
  '48': 'upon another, that shall not be thrown down.  3 And as he sat upon the mount
    of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him
    privately, 4 Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when
    all these '

  '1': ' 8 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and
    there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles:
    these are the beginnings of sorrows. 9 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall
    deliver you '
  '2': 'up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be
    brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.  10
    And the gospel must first be published among all nations. 11 But when they shall
    lead you, and deliver '
  '3': 'you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate:
    but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye
    that speak, but the Holy Ghost.  12 Now the brother shall betray the brother to
    death, and '
  '4': 'the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and
    shall cause them to be put to death.  13 And ye shall be hated of all men for
    my name''s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
    14 But when ye shall '
  '5': 'see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing
    where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in
    Judaea flee to the mountains:  15 And let him that is on the housetop not go down
    into the house, '
  '6': 'neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:  16 And let him
    that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment. 17 But woe
    to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! 18 And
    pray ye that your '
  '7': 'flight be not in the winter.  19 For in those days shall be affliction, such
    as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time,
    neither shall be. 20 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
    should be saved: '
  '8': 'but for the elect''s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.  21
    And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there;
    believe him not: 22 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall
    shew signs and '
  '9': 'wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.  23 But take ye heed:
    behold, I have foretold you all things. 24 But in those days, after that tribulation,
    the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, 25 And the stars
    of '
  '10': 'heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.  26
    And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and
    glory. 27 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect
    from the four '
  '11': 'winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.  28
    Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth
    forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: 29 So ye in like manner, when ye shall
    see these '
  '12': 'things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.  30 Verily
    I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be
    done. 31 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. 32
    But of that day and that '
  '13': 'hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the
    Son, but the Father.  33 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the
    time is. 34 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his
    house, and gave '
  '14': 'authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter
    to watch.  35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house
    cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: 36
    Lest coming '

  '16': "\nChapter 14\n After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened\
    \ bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him\
    \ by craft, and put him to death. 2 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest\
    \ there be an uproar of the "
  '17': 'people.  3 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat
    at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very
    precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head. 4 And there were some
    that had '
  '18': 'indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment
    made?  5 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have
    been given to the poor. And they murmured against her. 6 And Jesus said, Let her
    alone; why '
  '19': 'trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.  7 For ye have the poor
    with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not
    always. 8 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body
    to the burying. 9 '
  '20': 'Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout
    the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial
    of her.  10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests,
    to betray him unto '
  '21': 'them.  11 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him
    money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him. 12 And the first day
    of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him,
    Where wilt thou '
  '22': 'that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?  13 And he sendeth
    forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there
    shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him. 14 And wheresoever
    he shall go in, '
  '23': 'say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber,
    where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?  15 And he will shew you a large
    upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us. 16 And his disciples
    went '
  '24': 'forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they
    made ready the passover.  17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. 18
    And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which
    eateth with me shall '
  '25': 'betray me.  19 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by
    one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I? 20 And he answered and said unto them,
    It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish. 21 The Son of man indeed
    goeth, as it is '
  '26': 'written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good
    were it for that man if he had never been born.  22 And as they did eat, Jesus
    took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat:
    this is my body. 23 '
  '27': 'And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and
    they all drank of it.  24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
    which is shed for many. 25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the
    fruit of the '
  '28': 'vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.  26 And when
    they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. 27 And Jesus saith
    unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written,
    I will smite '
  '29': 'the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.  28 But after that I am risen,
    I will go before you into Galilee. 29 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall
    be offended, yet will not I. 30 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
    That this '
  '30': 'day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.  31
    But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee
    in any wise. Likewise also said they all. 32 And they came to a place which was
    named '
  '31': 'Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.  33
    And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed,
    and to be very heavy; 34 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto
    death: tarry ye '
  '32': 'here, and watch.  35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground,
    and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. 36 And he
    said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from
    me: nevertheless not '
  '33': 'what I will, but what thou wilt.  37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping,
    and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?
    38 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready,
    but the flesh is '
  '34': 'weak.  39 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words. 40
    And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,)
    neither wist they what to answer him. 41 And he cometh the third time, and saith
    unto them, Sleep on '
  '35': 'now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son
    of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  42 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that
    betrayeth me is at hand. 43 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas,
    one of the twelve, '
  '36': 'and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests
    and the scribes and the elders.  44 And he that betrayed him had given them a
    token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him
    away safely. 45 And '
  '37': 'as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master;
    and kissed him.  46 And they laid their hands on him, and took him. 47 And one
    of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and
    cut off his ear. '
  '38': '48 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief,
    with swords and with staves to take me?  49 I was daily with you in the temple
    teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled. 50 And they
    all forsook him, '
  '39': 'and fled.  51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen
    cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him: 52 And he
    left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. 53 And they led Jesus away to
    the high priest: and with '
  '40': 'him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.  54
    And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and
    he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire. 55 And the chief priests
    and all the '
  '41': 'council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.  56
    For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
    57 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, 58 We
    heard him say, '
  '42': 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days
    I will build another made without hands.  59 But neither so did their witness
    agree together. 60 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
    saying, Answerest thou '
  '43': 'nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  61 But he held his
    peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him,
    Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? 62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall
    see the Son of '
  '44': 'man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  63
    Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
    64 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be
    guilty of '
  '45': 'death.  65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet
    him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms
    of their hands. 66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of
    the maids of '
  '46': 'the high priest:  67 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon
    him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. 68 But he denied, saying,
    I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch;
    and the '
  '47': 'cock crew.  69 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood
    by, This is one of them. 70 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that
    stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean,
    and thy '
  '48': 'speech agreeth thereto.  71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I
    know not this man of whom ye speak. 72 And the second time the cock crew. And
    Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice,
    thou shalt deny me '
  '49': 'thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept. '
  '50': "\nChapter 15\n And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation\
    \ with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried\
    \ him away, and delivered him to Pilate."

  '1': ' 2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said
    unto them, Thou sayest it. 3 And the chief priests accused him of many things:
    but he answered nothing. 4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou
    nothing? behold how '
  '2': 'many things they witness against thee.  5 But Jesus yet answered nothing;
    so that Pilate marvelled. 6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner,
    whomsoever they desired. 7 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with
    them that had '
  '3': 'made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.  8
    And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto
    them. 9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the
    King of the Jews? '
  '4': '10 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.  11 But
    the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto
    them. 12 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that
    I shall do unto him '
  '5': 'whom ye call the King of the Jews?  13 And they cried out again, Crucify him.
    14 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out
    the more exceedingly, Crucify him. 15 And so Pilate, willing to content the people,
    released '
  '6': 'Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.  16
    And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call
    together the whole band. 17 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown
    of '
  '7': 'thorns, and put it about his head,  18 And began to salute him, Hail, King
    of the Jews! 19 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon
    him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. 20 And when they had mocked him, they
    took off the purple '
  '8': 'from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.  21
    And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country,
    the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. 22 And they bring him unto
    the place '
  '9': 'Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.  23 And they
    gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. 24 And when
    they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what
    every man should take. '
  '10': '25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.  26 And the superscription
    of his accusation was written over, The King Of The Jews. 27 And with him they
    crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. 28
    And the scripture '
  '11': 'was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.  29
    And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou
    that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, 30 Save thyself, and
    come down from the '
  '12': 'cross.  31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
    with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. 32 Let Christ the King
    of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that
    were crucified with '
  '13': 'him reviled him.  33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness
    over the whole land until the ninth hour. 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried
    with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted,
    My God, my God, '
  '14': 'why hast thou forsaken me?  35 And some of them that stood by, when they
    heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. 36 And one ran and filled a spunge full
    of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let
    us see whether Elias '
  '15': 'will come to take him down.  37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave
    up the ghost. 38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
    the bottom. 39 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that
    he so cried out, and '
  '16': 'gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.  40 There
    were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
    mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; 41 (Who also, when he was in
    Galilee, followed '
  '17': 'him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him
    unto Jerusalem.  42 And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,
    that is, the day before the sabbath, 43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor,
    which '
  '18': 'also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate,
    and craved the body of Jesus.  44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead:
    and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while
    dead. 45 And when he '
  '19': 'knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.  46 And he bought fine
    linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre
    which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
    47 And Mary '
  '20': 'Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid. '
  '21': "\nChapter 16\n And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the\
    \ mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and\
    \ anoint him. 2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they\
    \ came unto the sepulchre at "
  '22': 'the rising of the sun.  3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll
    us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? 4 And when they looked, they
    saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. 5 And entering into
    the sepulchre, they saw '
  '23': 'a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and
    they were affrighted.  6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus
    of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place
    where they laid '
  '24': 'him.  7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before
    you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. 8 And they went
    out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither
    said they any '
  '25': 'thing to any man; for they were afraid.  9 Now when Jesus was risen early
    the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he
    had cast seven devils. 10 And she went and told them that had been with him, as
    they mourned and wept. '
  '26': '11 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of
    her, believed not.  12 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them,
    as they walked, and went into the country. 13 And they went and told it unto the
    residue: neither '
  '27': 'believed they them.  14 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat
    at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because
    they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. 15 And he said unto
    them, Go ye into all '
  '28': 'the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.  16 He that believeth
    and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. 17
    And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out
    devils; they shall speak '
  '29': 'with new tongues;  18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any
    deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they
    shall recover. 19 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received
    up into heaven, and '
  '30': sat on the right hand of God.  20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.

    one.  15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any
    man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in
    the world, the lust '
  '14': 'of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of
    the Father, but is of the world.  17 And the world passeth away, and the lust
    thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 18 Little children,
    it is the last time: '
  '15': 'and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many
    antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.  19 They went out from
    us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have
    continued with us: but '
  '16': 'they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of
    us.  20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. 21 I
    have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it,
    and that no lie is of '
  '17': 'the truth.  22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?
    He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. 23 Whosoever denieth the
    Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father
    also. 24 Let that '
  '18': 'therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which
    ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in
    the Son, and in the Father.  25 And this is the promise that he hath promised
    us, even eternal '
  '19': 'life.  26 These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce
    you. 27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye
    need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all
    things, and is truth, '
  '20': 'and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.  28
    And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have
    confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 29 If ye know that he
    is righteous, ye know '
  '21': 'that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him. '
  '22': "\nChapter 3\n Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,\
    \ that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not,\
    \ because it knew him not. 2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth\
    \ not yet appear what we "
  '23': 'shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for
    we shall see him as he is.  3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth
    himself, even as he is pure. 4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the
    law: for sin is the '
  '24': 'transgression of the law.  5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away
    our sins; and in him is no sin. 6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever
    sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. 7 Little children, let no man deceive
    you: he that '
  '25': 'doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.  8 He that committeth
    sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose
    the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 9
    Whosoever is '
  '26': 'born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot
    sin, because he is born of God.  10 In this the children of God are manifest,
    and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,
    neither he that '
  '27': 'loveth not his brother.  11 For this is the message that ye heard from the
    beginning, that we should love one another. 12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked
    one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were
    evil, and his '
  '28': 'brother''s righteous.  13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
    14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.
    He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 15 Whosoever hateth his brother
    is a murderer: and '
  '29': 'ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.  16 Hereby perceive
    we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay
    down our lives for the brethren. 17 But whoso hath this world''s good, and seeth
    his brother have '
  '30': 'need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the
    love of God in him?  18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in
    tongue; but in deed and in truth. 19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth,
    and shall assure '
  '31': 'our hearts before him.  20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than
    our heart, and knoweth all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then
    have we confidence toward God. 22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because
    we keep his '
  '32': 'commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.  23 And
    this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ,
    and love one another, as he gave us commandment. 24 And he that keepeth his commandments '
  '33': 'dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us,
    by the Spirit which he hath given us. '
  '34': "\nChapter 4\n Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether\
    \ they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 2\
    \ Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ\
    \ is come in the flesh is "
  '35': 'of God:  3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come
    in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye
    have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. 4 Ye
    are of God, little '
  '36': 'children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than
    he that is in the world.  5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the
    world, and the world heareth them. 6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth
    us; he that is not '
  '37': 'of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit
    of error.  7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one
    that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 8 He that loveth not knoweth not
    God; for God is love. '
  '38': '9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent
    his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.  10 Herein
    is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
    propitiation for '
  '39': 'our sins.  11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
    12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us,
    and his love is perfected in us. 13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he
    in us, because '
  '40': 'he hath given us of his Spirit.  14 And we have seen and do testify that
    the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. 15 Whosoever shall confess
    that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. 16 And we have
    known and believed '
  '41': 'the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth
    in God, and God in him.  17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have
    boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. 18
    There is no fear '
  '42': 'in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He
    that feareth is not made perfect in love.  19 We love him, because he first loved
    us. 20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he
    that loveth not his '
  '43': brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?  21 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
  '44': "\nChapter 5\n Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God:\
    \ and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of\
    \ him. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and\
    \ keep his commandments. 3 "
  '45': 'For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments
    are not grievous.  4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this
    is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 5 Who is he that overcometh
    the '
  '46': 'world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?  6 This is he
    that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water
    and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
    7 For there are '
  '47': 'three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost:
    and these three are one.  8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the
    Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. 9 If we receive
    the witness of '
  '48': 'men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which
    he hath testified of his Son.  10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the
    witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he
    believeth not the record '
  '49': 'that God gave of his Son.  11 And this is the record, that God hath given
    to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 He that hath the Son hath
    life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. 13 These things have
    I written unto you that '
  '50': 'believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal
    life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.  14 And this is the
    confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will,
    he heareth us:'

  '1': ' Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration
    of those things which are most surely believed among us, 2 Even as they delivered
    them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the
    word; 3 It seemed '
  '2': 'good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very
    first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,  4 That thou mightest
    know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed. 5 There
    was in the '
  '3': 'days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the
    course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.  6
    And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances '
  '4': 'of the Lord blameless.  7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was
    barren, and they both were now well stricken in years. 8 And it came to pass,
    that while he executed the priest''s office before God in the order of his course,
    9 According to the '
  '5': 'custom of the priest''s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into
    the temple of the Lord.  10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying
    without at the time of incense. 11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the
    Lord standing on the '
  '6': 'right side of the altar of incense.  12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was
    troubled, and fear fell upon him. 13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias:
    for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou
    shalt call '
  '7': 'his name John.  14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
    at his birth. 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink
    neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even
    from his '
  '8': 'mother''s womb.  16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the
    Lord their God. 17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,
    to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the
    wisdom of the just; to '
  '9': 'make ready a people prepared for the Lord.  18 And Zacharias said unto the
    angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken
    in years. 19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in
    the presence of '
  '10': 'God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.  20
    And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these
    things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be
    fulfilled in '
  '11': 'their season.  21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that
    he tarried so long in the temple. 22 And when he came out, he could not speak
    unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he
    beckoned unto them, and '
  '12': 'remained speechless.  23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of
    his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. 24 And after
    those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
    25 Thus hath the Lord '
  '13': 'dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach
    among men.  26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
    a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name
    was Joseph, of the '
  '14': 'house of David; and the virgin''s name was Mary.  28 And the angel came in
    unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee:
    blessed art thou among women. 29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his
    saying, and cast in '
  '15': 'her mind what manner of salutation this should be.  30 And the angel said
    unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 31 And, behold,
    thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name
    Jesus. 32 He shall be '
  '16': 'great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall
    give unto him the throne of his father David:  33 And he shall reign over the
    house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. 34 Then said
    Mary unto the angel, '
  '17': 'How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?  35 And the angel answered and
    said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest
    shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
    shall be called '
  '18': 'the Son of God.  36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived
    a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
    37 For with God nothing shall be impossible. 38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid
    of the '
  '19': 'Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.  39
    And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into
    a city of Juda; 40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
    41 And it came '
  '20': 'to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped
    in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:  42 And she spake out
    with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the
    fruit of thy womb. '
  '21': '43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?  44
    For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe
    leaped in my womb for joy. 45 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall
    be a performance '
  '22': 'of those things which were told her from the Lord.  46 And Mary said, My
    soul doth magnify the Lord, 47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
    48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth
    all generations '
  '23': 'shall call me blessed.  49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;
    and holy is his name. 50 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation
    to generation. 51 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the
    proud in the '
  '24': 'imagination of their hearts.  52 He hath put down the mighty from their seats,
    and exalted them of low degree. 53 He hath filled the hungry with good things;
    and the rich he hath sent empty away. 54 He hath helped his servant Israel, in
    remembrance of his '
  '25': 'mercy;  55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
    56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
    57 Now Elisabeth''s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought
    forth a son. 58 And '
  '26': 'her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy
    upon her; and they rejoiced with her.  59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth
    day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the
    name of his father. '
  '27': '60 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.  61
    And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.
    62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. 63 And he
    asked for a '
  '28': 'writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.  64
    And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and
    praised God. 65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these
    sayings were '
  '29': 'noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.  66 And all they
    that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall
    this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him. 67 And his father Zacharias was
    filled with the Holy '
  '30': 'Ghost, and prophesied, saying,  68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for
    he hath visited and redeemed his people, 69 And hath raised up an horn of salvation
    for us in the house of his servant David; 70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy
    prophets, which '
  '31': 'have been since the world began:  71 That we should be saved from our enemies,
    and from the hand of all that hate us; 72 To perform the mercy promised to our
    fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; 73 The oath which he sware to our
    father Abraham, 74 '
  '32': 'That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our
    enemies might serve him without fear,  75 In holiness and righteousness before
    him, all the days of our life. 76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet
    of the Highest: for '
  '33': 'thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;  77 To give
    knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins, 78 Through
    the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,
    79 To give light '
  '34': to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.  80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.
  '35': "\nChapter 2\n And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree\
    \ from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. 2 (And this taxing\
    \ was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) 3 And all went to be taxed,\
    \ every one into his own "
  '36': 'city.  4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
    into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was
    of the house and lineage of David:) 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife,
    being great with '
  '37': 'child.  6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished
    that she should be delivered. 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped
    him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room
    for them in '
  '38': 'the inn.  8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
    keeping watch over their flock by night. 9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came
    upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore
    afraid. 10 And '
  '39': 'the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings
    of great joy, which shall be to all people.  11 For unto you is born this day
    in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. 12 And this shall be
    a sign unto you; Ye '
  '40': 'shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.  13
    And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising
    God, and saying, 14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
    toward men. 15 And it '
  '41': 'came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds
    said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which
    is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.  16 And they came with
    haste, and '
  '42': 'found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.  17 And when they
    had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning
    this child. 18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were
    told them by the '
  '43': 'shepherds.  19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
    20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things
    that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. 21 And when eight days
    were accomplished '
  '44': 'for the circumcising of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was so
    named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.  22 And when the days
    of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought
    him to Jerusalem, to '
  '45': 'present him to the Lord;  23 (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every
    male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) 24 And to offer
    a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of
    turtledoves, or two '
  '46': 'young pigeons.  25 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name
    was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation
    of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. 26 And it was revealed unto him by
    the Holy Ghost, that he '
  '47': 'should not see death, before he had seen the Lord''s Christ.  27 And he came
    by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus,
    to do for him after the custom of the law, 28 Then took he him up in his arms,
    and blessed God, and '
  '48': 'said,  29 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to
    thy word: 30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, 31 Which thou hast prepared
    before the face of all people; 32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory
    of thy people '
  '49': 'Israel.  33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were
    spoken of him. 34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold,
    this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign
    which shall be '
  '50': spoken against;  35 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

  '1': ' 36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the
    tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years
    from her virginity; 37 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years,
    which departed not '
  '2': 'from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.  38
    And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of
    him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. 39 And when they had
    performed all things '
  '3': 'according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own
    city Nazareth.  40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
    wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. 41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem
    every year at the '
  '4': 'feast of the passover.  42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up
    to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. 43 And when they had fulfilled the
    days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph
    and his mother knew '
  '5': 'not of it.  44 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a
    day''s journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. 45
    And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.
    46 And it came to pass, '
  '6': 'that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of
    the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.  47 And all that heard
    him were astonished at his understanding and answers. 48 And when they saw him,
    they were amazed: '
  '7': 'and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold,
    thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.  49 And he said unto them, How is
    it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father''s business?
    50 And they understood '
  '8': 'not the saying which he spake unto them.  51 And he went down with them, and
    came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings
    in her heart. 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with
    God and man.'

  '10': 'Abilene,  2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came
    unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. 3 And he came into all the country
    about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; 4
    As it is '
  '11': 'written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice
    of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths
    straight.  5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be
    brought low; and the '
  '12': 'crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;  6
    And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. 7 Then said he to the multitude
    that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned
    you to flee from the '
  '13': 'wrath to come?  8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and
    begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto
    you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 9 And
    now also the axe is '
  '14': 'laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not
    forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  10 And the people asked
    him, saying, What shall we do then? 11 He answereth and saith unto them, He that
    hath two coats, let '
  '15': 'him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.  12
    Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall
    we do? 13 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.
    14 And the '
  '16': 'soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said
    unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with
    your wages.  15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their
    hearts of '
  '17': 'John, whether he were the Christ, or not;  16 John answered, saying unto
    them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the
    latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the
    Holy Ghost and with '
  '18': 'fire:  17 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor,
    and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire

    people. 19 But Herod '
  '19': 'the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip''s wife,
    and for all the evils which Herod had done,  20 Added yet this above all, that
    he shut up John in prison. 21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to
    pass, that Jesus '

  '30': "\nChapter 4\n And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan,\
    \ and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 2 Being forty days tempted of\

  '31': 'the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that
    it be made bread.  4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall
    not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. 5 And the devil, taking him
    up into an high '
  '32': 'mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.  6
    And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of
    them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. 7 If
    thou therefore '
  '33': 'wilt worship me, all shall be thine.  8 And Jesus answered and said unto
    him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord
    thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and
    set him on a pinnacle of '
  '34': 'the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down
    from hence:  10 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee,
    to keep thee: 11 And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time
    thou dash thy foot '
  '35': 'against a stone.  12 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou
    shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation,
    he departed from him for a season. 14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit
    into '
  '36': 'Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.  15
    And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. 16 And he came to Nazareth,
    where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue
    on '
  '37': 'the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.  17 And there was delivered unto
    him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found
    the place where it was written, 18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because
    he hath anointed me to '
  '38': 'preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
    to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to
    set at liberty them that are bruised,  19 To preach the acceptable year of the
    Lord. 20 And he closed '
  '39': 'the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes
    of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.  21 And he began
    to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. 22 And all
    bare him witness, and '
  '40': 'wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they
    said, Is not this Joseph''s son?  23 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say
    unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in
    Capernaum, do also here '
  '41': 'in thy country.  24 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted
    in his own country. 25 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in
    the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when
    great famine was '
  '42': 'throughout all the land;  26 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto
    Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. 27 And many lepers were
    in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving
    Naaman the '
  '43': 'Syrian.  28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things,
    were filled with wrath, 29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led
    him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast
    him down headlong. 30 '
  '44': 'But he passing through the midst of them went his way,  31 And came down
    to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days. 32 And they
    were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power. 33 And in the synagogue
    there was a '
  '45': 'man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,  34
    Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art
    thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God. 35 And
    Jesus rebuked '
  '46': 'him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had
    thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.  36 And they were
    all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with
    authority and power he '
  '47': 'commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.  37 And the fame of him
    went out into every place of the country round about. 38 And he arose out of the
    synagogue, and entered into Simon''s house. And Simon''s wife''s mother was taken
    with a great fever; '
  '48': 'and they besought him for her.  39 And he stood over her, and rebuked the
    fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them. 40
    Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases
    brought them unto him; '
  '49': 'and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.  41 And devils
    also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God.
    And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.
    42 And when it '
  '50': 'was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought
    him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.  43
    And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also:
    for therefore am I sent.'
LukeBook3:
  '1': ' 44 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.'
  '2': "\nChapter 5\n And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to\
    \ hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, 2 And saw two ships\
    \ standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing\
    \ their nets. 3 And he "
  '3': 'entered into one of the ships, which was Simon''s, and prayed him that he
    would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people
    out of the ship.  4 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch
    out into the deep, and '
  '4': 'let down your nets for a draught.  5 And Simon answering said unto him, Master,
    we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word
    I will let down the net. 6 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great
    multitude of '
  '5': 'fishes: and their net brake.  7 And they beckoned unto their partners, which
    were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and
    filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. 8 When Simon Peter saw it,
    he fell down at '
  '6': 'Jesus'' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.  9 For
    he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which
    they had taken: 10 And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which
    were partners with '
  '7': 'Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch
    men.  11 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and
    followed him. 12 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a
    man full of leprosy: '
  '8': 'who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou
    wilt, thou canst make me clean.  13 And he put forth his hand, and touched him,
    saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
    14 And he charged him '
  '9': 'to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy
    cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.  15 But so
    much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together
    to hear, and to be '
  '10': 'healed by him of their infirmities.  16 And he withdrew himself into the
    wilderness, and prayed. 17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching,
    that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out
    of every town of '
  '11': 'Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present
    to heal them.  18 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with
    a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him. 19
    And when they could not '
  '12': 'find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went
    upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the
    midst before Jesus.  20 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy
    sins are forgiven '
  '13': 'thee.  21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who
    is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 22 But
    when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason
    ye in your hearts? 23 '
  '14': 'Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up
    and walk?  24 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to
    forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and
    take up thy couch, and '
  '15': 'go into thine house.  25 And immediately he rose up before them, and took
    up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. 26 And
    they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying,
    We have seen strange '
  '16': 'things to day.  27 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican,
    named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.
    28 And he left all, rose up, and followed him. 29 And Levi made him a great feast
    in his own house: '
  '17': 'and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with
    them.  30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying,
    Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 31 And Jesus answering said
    unto them, They '
  '18': 'that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.  32 I came not
    to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. 33 And they said unto him, Why
    do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples
    of the '
  '19': 'Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?  34 And he said unto them, Can ye make
    the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? 35 But
    the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then
    shall they fast in '
  '20': 'those days.  36 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece
    of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and
    the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old. 37 And no man
    putteth new wine '
  '21': 'into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled,
    and the bottles shall perish.  38 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and
    both are preserved. 39 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth
    new: for he saith, '
  '22': 'The old is better. '
  '23': "\nChapter 6\n And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first,\
    \ that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of\
    \ corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. 2 And certain of the Pharisees\
    \ said unto them, Why do ye "
  '24': 'that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?  3 And Jesus answering
    them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was
    an hungred, and they which were with him; 4 How he went into the house of God,
    and did take and eat '
  '25': 'the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not
    lawful to eat but for the priests alone?  5 And he said unto them, That the Son
    of man is Lord also of the sabbath. 6 And it came to pass also on another sabbath,
    that he entered '
  '26': 'into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.  7
    And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath
    day; that they might find an accusation against him. 8 But he knew their thoughts,
    and '
  '27': 'said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in
    the midst. And he arose and stood forth.  9 Then said Jesus unto them, I will
    ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil?
    to save life, or to '
  '28': 'destroy it?  10 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man,
    Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the
    other. 11 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what
    they might do to '
  '29': 'Jesus.  12 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain
    to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. 13 And when it was day, he
    called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named
    apostles; 14 Simon, '
  '30': '(whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip
    and Bartholomew,  15 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon
    called Zelotes, 16 And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also
    was the traitor. 17 '
  '31': 'And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his
    disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and
    from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed
    of their diseases;  '
  '32': '18 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.  19
    And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him,
    and healed them all. 20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said,
    Blessed be ye poor: '
  '33': 'for yours is the kingdom of God.  21 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for
    ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh. 22 Blessed
    are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company,
    and shall '
  '34': 'reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man''s sake.  23
    Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in
    heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets. 24 But woe
    unto you that are '
  '35': 'rich! for ye have received your consolation.  25 Woe unto you that are full!
    for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
    26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers
    to the false '
  '36': 'prophets.  27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to
    them which hate you, 28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully
    use you. 29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other;
    and him '
  '37': 'that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.  30 Give to
    every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them
    not again. 31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
    32 For if ye love '
  '38': 'them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that
    love them.  33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have
    ye? for sinners also do even the same. 34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope
    to receive, what '
  '39': 'thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.  35
    But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and
    your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he
    is kind unto the '
  '40': 'unthankful and to the evil.  36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father
    also is merciful. 37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye
    shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 38 Give, and it shall
    be given unto you; '
  '41': 'good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall
    men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall
    be measured to you again.  39 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind
    lead the blind? shall '
  '42': 'they not both fall into the ditch?  40 The disciple is not above his master:
    but every one that is perfect shall be as his master. 41 And why beholdest thou
    the mote that is in thy brother''s eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in
    thine own eye? 42 '
  '43': 'Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote
    that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine
    own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then
    shalt thou see '
  '44': 'clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother''s eye.  43 For a good
    tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth
    good fruit. 44 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do
    not gather figs, nor of '
  '45': 'a bramble bush gather they grapes.  45 A good man out of the good treasure
    of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil
    treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance
    of the heart his mouth '
  '46': 'speaketh.  46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which
    I say? 47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will
    shew you to whom he is like: 48 He is like a man which built an house, and digged
    deep, and laid the '
  '47': 'foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently
    upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.  49 But
    he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built
    an house upon the '
  '48': 'earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell;
    and the ruin of that house was great. '
  '49': "\nChapter 7\n Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the\

    \ was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. 3 And when he heard of Jesus,\
    \ he sent unto him the elders "
  '50': 'of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.  4 And

  '1': ' 6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house,
    the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself:
    for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: 7 Wherefore neither
    thought I myself '
  '2': 'worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.  8
    For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto
    one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant,
    Do this, and '

    him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have
    not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 10 And they that were sent, returning
    to the house, '
  '4': 'found the servant whole that had been sick.  11 And it came to pass the day
    after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with
    him, and much people. 12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold,
    there was a dead '
  '5': 'man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much
    people of the city was with her.  13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion
    on her, and said unto her, Weep not. 14 And he came and touched the bier: and
    they that bare him '
  '6': 'stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.  15 And he that
    was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. 16 And
    there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet
    is risen up among '
  '7': 'us; and, That God hath visited his people.  17 And this rumour of him went
    forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about. 18 And
    the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. 19 And John calling unto
    him two of his '
  '8': 'disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look
    we for another?  20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath
    sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
    21 And in that '
  '9': 'same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits;
    and unto many that were blind he gave sight.  22 Then Jesus answering said unto
    them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that
    the blind see, the '
  '10': 'lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to
    the poor the gospel is preached.  23 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be
    offended in me. 24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to
    speak unto the people '
  '11': 'concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed
    shaken with the wind?  25 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
    raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are
    in kings'' courts. 26 '
  '12': 'But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much
    more than a prophet.  27 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
    messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 28 For I say
    unto you, Among those '
  '13': 'that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist:
    but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.  29 And all the
    people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the
    baptism of John. '
  '14': '30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves,
    being not baptized of him.  31 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken
    the men of this generation? and to what are they like? 32 They are like unto children
    sitting '
  '15': 'in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped
    unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.  33
    For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say,
    He hath a devil. 34 '
  '16': 'The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous
    man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!  35 But wisdom is justified
    of all her children. 36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat
    with him. And '
  '17': 'he went into the Pharisee''s house, and sat down to meat.  37 And, behold,
    a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat
    in the Pharisee''s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, 38 And stood at
    his feet behind him '
  '18': 'weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the
    hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.  39
    Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying,
    This man, if he '
  '19': 'were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that
    toucheth him: for she is a sinner.  40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon,
    I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. 41 There was a
    certain creditor '
  '20': 'which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.  42
    And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore,
    which of them will love him most? 43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he,
    to whom he '
  '21': 'forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.  44 And he
    turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into
    thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet
    with tears, and wiped '
  '22': 'them with the hairs of her head.  45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman
    since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. 46 My head with oil
    thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. 47
    Wherefore I say unto '
  '23': 'thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to
    whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.  48 And he said unto her, Thy
    sins are forgiven. 49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves,
    Who is this '
  '24': that forgiveth sins also?  50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
  '25': "\nChapter 8\n And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every\
    \ city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God:\
    \ and the twelve were with him, 2 And certain women, which had been healed of\
    \ evil spirits and "
  '26': 'infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,  3 And
    Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod''s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which
    ministered unto him of their substance. 4 And when much people were gathered together,
    and were come to '
  '27': 'him out of every city, he spake by a parable:  5 A sower went out to sow
    his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down,
    and the fowls of the air devoured it. 6 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon
    as it was sprung up, it '
  '28': 'withered away, because it lacked moisture.  7 And some fell among thorns;
    and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. 8 And other fell on good ground,
    and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things,
    he cried, He that '
  '29': 'hath ears to hear, let him hear.  9 And his disciples asked him, saying,
    What might this parable be? 10 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries
    of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see,
    and hearing '
  '30': 'they might not understand.  11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word
    of God. 12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and
    taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.
    13 They on the '
  '31': 'rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these
    have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.  14
    And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth,
    and are choked '
  '32': 'with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.  15
    But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having
    heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. 16 No man, when
    he hath '
  '33': 'lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but
    setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.  17 For
    nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that
    shall not be known '
  '34': 'and come abroad.  18 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath,
    to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that
    which he seemeth to have. 19 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and
    could not come at him '
  '35': 'for the press.  20 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother
    and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. 21 And he answered and said
    unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and
    do it. 22 Now it came '
  '36': 'to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and
    he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched
    forth.  23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind
    on the lake; '
  '37': 'and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.  24 And they came
    to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked
    the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. 25
    And he said unto '
  '38': 'them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to
    another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water,
    and they obey him.  26 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which
    is over against '
  '39': 'Galilee.  27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city
    a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode
    in any house, but in the tombs. 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down
    before him, and with '
  '40': 'a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most
    high? I beseech thee, torment me not.  29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit
    to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound
    with chains and '
  '41': 'in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the
    wilderness.)  30 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion:
    because many devils were entered into him. 31 And they besought him that he would
    not command '
  '42': 'them to go out into the deep.  32 And there was there an herd of many swine
    feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter
    into them. And he suffered them. 33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered
    into the '
  '43': 'swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were
    choked.  34 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and
    told it in the city and in the country. 35 Then they went out to see what was
    done; and came to '
  '44': 'Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at
    the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.  36 They
    also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils
    was healed. 37 Then '
  '45': 'the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought
    him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into
    the ship, and returned back again.  38 Now the man out of whom the devils were
    departed besought him '
  '46': 'that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,  39 Return to
    thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went
    his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done
    unto him. 40 And it '
  '47': 'came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him:
    for they were all waiting for him.  41 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus,
    and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus'' feet, and besought
    him that he '
  '48': 'would come into his house:  42 For he had one only daughter, about twelve
    years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him. 43
    And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living
    upon physicians, '
  '49': 'neither could be healed of any,  44 Came behind him, and touched the border
    of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched. 45 And Jesus said,
    Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master,
    the multitude '
  '50': 'throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  46 And Jesus
    said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.'

    went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where. 7 Now Herod
    the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because
    that it was said '
  '9': 'of some, that John was risen from the dead;  8 And of some, that Elias had
    appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. 9 And Herod
    said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he
    desired to see '

    and he received '

    country round about, '

    said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves
    and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people. 14 For they
    were about '
  '13': 'five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties
    in a company.  15 And they did so, and made them all sit down. 16 Then he took
    the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them,
    and brake, and '

    and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them
    twelve baskets. 18 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples
    were with him: and he '

    is risen again. 20 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering
    said, The '

    day. 23 '

    cast away?  26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall
    the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father''s,
    and of the holy '
  '19': 'angels.  27 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which
    shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God. 28 And it came to
    pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James,
    and went up into a '
  '20': 'mountain to pray.  29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was
    altered, and his raiment was white and glistering. 30 And, behold, there talked
    with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: 31 Who appeared in glory, and spake
    of his decease '
  '21': 'which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.  32 But Peter and they that were
    with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory,
    and the two men that stood with him. 33 And it came to pass, as they departed
    from him, Peter said unto '
  '22': 'Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles;
    one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.  34
    While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared
    as they '

    alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things
    which they had '

    down from the hill, much people met him. 38 And, behold, a man of the company
    cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only
    child. 39 And, lo, a '
  '25': 'spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he
    foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.  40 And I besought
    thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not. 41 And Jesus answering said,
    O faithless and '
  '26': 'perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring
    thy son hither.  42 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and
    tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered
    him again to his '
  '27': 'father.  43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while
    they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
    44 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered
    into the '
  '28': 'hands of men.  45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from
    them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying. 46
    Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest. 47
    And Jesus, perceiving '
  '29': 'the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,  48 And said
    unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever
    shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all,
    the same shall '
  '30': 'be great.  49 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out
    devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us. 50 And
    Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.
    51 And it came to pass, '
  '31': 'when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his
    face to go to Jerusalem,  52 And sent messengers before his face: and they went,
    and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. 53 And they
    did not receive '
  '32': 'him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.  54 And when
    his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command
    fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? 55 But he
    turned, and rebuked '
  '33': 'them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.  56 For the
    Son of man is not come to destroy men''s lives, but to save them. And they went
    to another village. 57 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain
    man said unto him, '
  '34': 'Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.  58 And Jesus said unto
    him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath
    not where to lay his head. 59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said,
    Lord, suffer me '
  '35': 'first to go and bury my father.  60 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury
    their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. 61 And another also said,
    Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at
    home at my house. 62 '
  '36': 'And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking
    back, is fit for the kingdom of God. '
  '37': "\nChapter 10\n After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also,\
    \ and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither\
    \ he himself would come. 2 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great,\
    \ but the labourers are "
  '38': 'few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth
    labourers into his harvest.  3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs
    among wolves. 4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by
    the way. 5 And into '
  '39': 'whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.  6 And if the
    son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to
    you again. 7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as
    they give: for the '
  '40': 'labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.  8 And into whatsoever
    city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: 9
    And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come
    nigh unto '
  '41': 'you.  10 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go
    your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, 11 Even the very dust of
    your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be
    ye sure of this, that '
  '42': 'the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.  12 But I say unto you, that it
    shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. 13 Woe unto
    thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done
    in Tyre and Sidon, '
  '43': 'which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting
    in sackcloth and ashes.  14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon
    at the judgment, than for you. 15 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven,
    shalt be thrust '
  '44': 'down to hell.  16 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
    despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. 17 And the
    seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto
    us through thy name. '
  '45': '18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.  19
    Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all
    the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. 20 Notwithstanding
    in this rejoice '
  '46': 'not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your
    names are written in heaven.  21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said,
    I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things
    from the wise '
  '47': 'and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it
    seemed good in thy sight.  22 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and
    no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the
    Son, and he to whom the '
  '48': 'Son will reveal him.  23 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,
    Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: 24 For I tell you, that
    many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have
    not seen '
  '49': 'them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.  25
    And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what
    shall I do to inherit eternal life? 26 He said unto him, What is written in the
    law? how readest thou? '
  '50': '27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
    and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy
    neighbour as thyself. '

    live. 29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
    30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
    and fell '
  '2': 'among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed,
    leaving him half dead.  31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that
    way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 32 And likewise a Levite,
    when he was '

    But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him,
    he had compassion on him, 34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring
    in oil and wine, '
  '4': 'and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of
    him.  35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them
    to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest
    more, when I come '
  '5': 'again, I will repay thee.  36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was
    neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? 37 And he said, He that shewed
    mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. 38 Now it came
    to pass, as they '
  '6': 'went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha
    received him into her house.  39 And she had a sister called Mary, which also
    sat at Jesus'' feet, and heard his word. 40 But Martha was cumbered about much
    serving, and came to '
  '7': 'him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve
    alone? bid her therefore that she help me.  41 And Jesus answered and said unto
    her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: 42 But one
    thing is needful: '
  '8': 'and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. '
  '9': "\nChapter 11\n And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place,\
    \ when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray,\
    \ as John also taught his disciples. 2 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say,\
    \ Our Father which art "
  '10': 'in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in
    heaven, so in earth.  3 Give us day by day our daily bread. 4 And forgive us our
    sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into
    temptation; but '
  '11': 'deliver us from evil.  5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a
    friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three
    loaves; 6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing
    to set before him? '
  '12': '7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now
    shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.  8 I say
    unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet
    because of his '
  '13': 'importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.  9 And I say
    unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and
    it shall be opened unto you. 10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that
    seeketh findeth; and '
  '14': 'to him that knocketh it shall be opened.  11 If a son shall ask bread of
    any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will
    he for a fish give him a serpent? 12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer
    him a scorpion? 13 If '

    much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?  14
    And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the
    devil was gone out, '
  '16': 'the dumb spake; and the people wondered.  15 But some of them said, He casteth
    out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils. 16 And others, tempting
    him, sought of him a sign from heaven. 17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said
    unto them, Every '
  '17': 'kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided
    against a house falleth.  18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall
    his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub. 19
    And if I by '
  '18': 'Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore
    shall they be your judges.  20 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils,
    no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you. 21 When a strong man armed keepeth
    his palace, his goods '
  '19': 'are in peace:  22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome
    him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.

  '20': 'When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places,
    seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I
    came out.  25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished. 26 Then goeth
    he, and taketh '
  '21': 'to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and
    dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.  27 And it
    came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted
    up her voice, and '
  '22': 'said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou
    hast sucked.  28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word
    of God, and keep it. 29 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began
    to say, This is an '
  '23': 'evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but
    the sign of Jonas the prophet.  30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites,
    so shall also the Son of man be to this generation. 31 The queen of the south
    shall rise up in the '
  '24': 'judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came
    from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold,
    a greater than Solomon is here.  32 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment
    with this '
  '25': 'generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas;
    and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.  33 No man, when he hath lighted a
    candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick,
    that they '
  '26': 'which come in may see the light.  34 The light of the body is the eye: therefore
    when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine
    eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. 35 Take heed therefore that the
    light which is '
  '27': 'in thee be not darkness.  36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light,
    having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining
    of a candle doth give thee light. 37 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought
    him to dine with '
  '28': 'him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.  38 And when the Pharisee saw
    it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner. 39 And the Lord said
    unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter;
    but your inward '
  '29': 'part is full of ravening and wickedness.  40 Ye fools, did not he that made
    that which is without make that which is within also? 41 But rather give alms
    of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you. 42 But
    woe unto you, '
  '30': 'Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over
    judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the
    other undone.  43 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in
    the synagogues, and '
  '31': 'greetings in the markets.  44 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
    for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not
    aware of them. 45 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,
    thus saying thou '
  '32': 'reproachest us also.  46 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for
    ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the
    burdens with one of your fingers. 47 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres
    of the prophets, and '
  '33': 'your fathers killed them.  48 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds
    of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres. 49
    Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles,
    and some of them '
  '34': 'they shall slay and persecute:  50 That the blood of all the prophets, which
    was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
    51 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the
    altar and the '
  '35': 'temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.  52
    Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered
    not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. 53 And as he said
    these things unto '
  '36': 'them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to
    provoke him to speak of many things:  54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch
    something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.'
  '37': "\nChapter 12\n In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable\
    \ multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to\
    \ say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees,\
    \ which is hypocrisy. "
  '38': '2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid,
    that shall not be known.  3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall
    be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall
    be proclaimed upon '
  '39': 'the housetops.  4 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that
    kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. 5 But I will forewarn
    you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast
    into hell; yea, '
  '40': 'I say unto you, Fear him.  6 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings,
    and not one of them is forgotten before God? 7 But even the very hairs of your
    head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
    8 Also I say unto '
  '41': 'you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also
    confess before the angels of God:  9 But he that denieth me before men shall be
    denied before the angels of God. 10 And whosoever shall speak a word against the
    Son of man, it shall '
  '42': 'be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it
    shall not be forgiven.  11 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto
    magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer,
    or what ye shall say: '
  '43': '12 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.  13
    And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide
    the inheritance with me. 14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or
    a divider over '
  '44': 'you?  15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for
    a man''s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
    16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man
    brought forth '
  '45': 'plentifully:  17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do,
    because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? 18 And he said, This will I
    do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all
    my fruits and my goods. 19 '
  '46': 'And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years;
    take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.  20 But God said unto him, Thou fool,
    this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be,
    which thou hast '
  '47': 'provided?  21 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich
    toward God. 22 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take
    no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall
    put on. 23 The life '
  '48': 'is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.  24 Consider the ravens:
    for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God
    feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls? 25 And which of you
    with taking thought '
  '49': 'can add to his stature one cubit?  26 If ye then be not able to do that thing
    which is least, why take ye thought for the rest? 27 Consider the lilies how they
    grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all
    his glory was '
  '50': not arrayed like one of these.  28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?

    fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt
    in Jerusalem? 5 I '
  '19': 'tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.  6 He
    spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard;
    and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the
    dresser of his vineyard, '
  '20': 'Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find
    none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?  8 And he answering said unto
    him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:
    9 And if it bear fruit, '
  '21': 'well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.  10 And he was
    teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. 11 And, behold, there was a
    woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together,
    and could in no wise lift '
  '22': 'up herself.  12 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto
    her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. 13 And he laid his hands on
    her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. 14 And the ruler
    of the synagogue '
  '23': 'answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day,
    and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them
    therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.  15 The Lord then answered
    him, and '
  '24': 'said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox
    or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?  16 And ought not this
    woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen
    years, be loosed from '
  '25': 'this bond on the sabbath day?  17 And when he had said these things, all
    his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious
    things that were done by him. 18 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God
    like? and whereunto '
  '26': 'shall I resemble it?  19 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man
    took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls
    of the air lodged in the branches of it. 20 And again he said, Whereunto shall
    I liken the kingdom '
  '27': 'of God?  21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures
    of meal, till the whole was leavened. 22 And he went through the cities and villages,
    teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. 23 Then said one unto him, Lord, are
    there few '
  '28': 'that be saved? And he said unto them,  24 Strive to enter in at the strait
    gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
    25 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and
    ye begin to stand '
  '29': 'without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and
    he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:  26 Then shall
    ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught
    in our streets. 27 But '
  '30': 'he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all
    ye workers of iniquity.  28 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when
    ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom
    of God, and you '
  '31': yourselves thrust out.  29 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. 30 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.
  '32': ' 31 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get
    thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee. 32 And he said unto them,
    Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and
    to morrow, and the '
  '33': 'third day I shall be perfected.  33 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and
    to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of
    Jerusalem. 34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest
    them that are sent unto '
  '34': 'thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth
    gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!  35 Behold, your house is
    left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until
    the time come when ye '
  '35': 'shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. '
  '36': "\nChapter 14\n And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the\
    \ chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. 2 And,\
    \ behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. 3 And Jesus\
    \ answering spake unto the "
  '37': 'lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?  4
    And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; 5
    And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into
    a pit, and will not '
  '38': 'straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?  6 And they could not answer
    him again to these things. 7 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden,
    when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them. 8 When thou
    art bidden of '
  '39': 'any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable
    man than thou be bidden of him;  9 And he that bade thee and him come and say
    to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.
    10 But when thou '
  '40': 'art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee
    cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship
    in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.  11 For whosoever exalteth
    himself shall be '
  '41': 'abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.  12 Then said he also
    to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends,
    nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also
    bid thee again, '
  '42': 'and a recompence be made thee.  13 But when thou makest a feast, call the
    poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: 14 And thou shalt be blessed; for they
    cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the
    just. 15 And when one '
  '43': 'of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed
    is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.  16 Then said he unto him, A
    certain man made a great supper, and bade many: 17 And sent his servant at supper
    time to say to '
  '44': 'them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.  18 And they all
    with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought
    a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.
    19 And another said, '
  '45': 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have
    me excused.  20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot
    come. 21 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master
    of the house being '
  '46': 'angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the
    city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.  22
    And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is
    room. 23 And '
  '47': 'the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and
    compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.  24 For I say unto you, That
    none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. 25 And there went
    great multitudes '
  '48': 'with him: and he turned, and said unto them,  26 If any man come to me, and
    hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters,
    yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. 27 And whosoever doth not
    bear his cross, '
  '49': 'and come after me, cannot be my disciple.  28 For which of you, intending
    to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have
    sufficient to finish it? 29 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and
    is not able to finish '

  '5': 'having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety
    and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?  5

    nine just persons, '
  '7': 'which need no repentance.  8 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver,

    lost.  10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels
    of God over one sinner that repenteth. 11 And he said, A certain man had two sons:
    12 And the younger '
  '9': 'of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth
    to me. And he divided unto them his living.  13 And not many days after the younger
    son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there
    wasted his '
  '10': 'substance with riotous living.  14 And when he had spent all, there arose
    a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. 15 And he went and joined
    himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed
    swine. 16 And he '
  '11': 'would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and
    no man gave unto him.  17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired
    servants of my father''s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!
    18 I will arise '
  '12': 'and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against
    heaven, and before thee,  19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make
    me as one of thy hired servants. 20 And he arose, and came to his father. But
    when he was yet a great '
  '13': 'way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his
    neck, and kissed him.  21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against
    heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. 22 But the
    father said to '
  '14': 'his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring
    on his hand, and shoes on his feet:  23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and
    kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: 24 For this my son was dead, and is alive
    again; he was lost, '
  '15': 'and is found. And they began to be merry.  25 Now his elder son was in the
    field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.
    26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. 27 And
    he said unto him, Thy '
  '16': 'brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath
    received him safe and sound.  28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore
    came his father out, and intreated him. 29 And he answering said to his father,
    Lo, these many '
  '17': 'years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment:
    and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:  30
    But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots,
    thou hast killed '
  '18': 'for him the fatted calf.  31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with
    me, and all that I have is thine. 32 It was meet that we should make merry, and
    be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and
    is found.'
  '19': "\nChapter 16\n And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich\
    \ man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted\
    \ his goods. 2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this\
    \ of thee? give an "
  '20': 'account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.  3 Then
    the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from
    me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. 4 I am resolved what to
    do, that, when I am put '
  '21': 'out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.  5 So he called
    every one of his lord''s debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest
    thou unto my lord? 6 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto
    him, Take thy '
  '22': 'bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.  7 Then said he to another,
    And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said
    unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. 8 And the lord commended the unjust
    steward, because he '
  '23': 'had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser
    than the children of light.  9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends
    of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into
    everlasting '
  '24': 'habitations.  10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also
    in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. 11 If therefore
    ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust
    the true '
  '25': 'riches?  12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man''s,
    who shall give you that which is your own? 13 No servant can serve two masters:
    for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the
    one, and despise '
  '26': 'the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  14 And the Pharisees also, who
    were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. 15 And he said unto
    them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts:
    for that which '
  '27': 'is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.  16 The
    law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached,
    and every man presseth into it. 17 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass,
    than one '
  '28': 'tittle of the law to fail.  18 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth
    another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from
    her husband committeth adultery. 19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed
    in purple and '
  '29': 'fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:  20 And there was a certain
    beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, 21 And desiring
    to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man''s table: moreover the
    dogs came and licked his '
  '30': 'sores.  22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
    the angels into Abraham''s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; 23 And
    in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and
    Lazarus in his bosom. '
  '31': '24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus,
    that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented
    in this flame.  25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst '
  '32': 'thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted,
    and thou art tormented.  26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a
    great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither
    can they pass to '
  '33': 'us, that would come from thence.  27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore,
    father, that thou wouldest send him to my father''s house: 28 For I have five
    brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of
    torment. 29 Abraham '
  '34': 'saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.  30
    And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they
    will repent. 31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
    neither will they be '
  '35': 'persuaded, though one rose from the dead. '
  '36': "\nChapter 17\n Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that\
    \ offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! 2 It were better\
    \ for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea,\
    \ than that he should "
  '37': 'offend one of these little ones.  3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother
    trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. 4 And if he
    trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again
    to thee, saying, I '
  '38': 'repent; thou shalt forgive him.  5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase
    our faith. 6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
    might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou
    planted in the '
  '39': 'sea; and it should obey you.  7 But which of you, having a servant plowing
    or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field,
    Go and sit down to meat? 8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith
    I may sup, and '
  '40': 'gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward
    thou shalt eat and drink?  9 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things
    that were commanded him? I trow not. 10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done
    all those things '
  '41': 'which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done
    that which was our duty to do.  11 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem,
    that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. 12 And as he entered
    into a certain village, '
  '42': 'there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:  13 And they
    lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. 14 And when
    he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came
    to pass, that, as '
  '43': 'they went, they were cleansed.  15 And one of them, when he saw that he was
    healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, 16 And fell down on
    his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. 17 And Jesus
    answering said, Were '
  '44': 'there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?  18 There are not found that
    returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. 19 And he said unto him, Arise,
    go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. 20 And when he was demanded of the
    Pharisees, when '
  '45': 'the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of
    God cometh not with observation:  21 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there!
    for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. 22 And he said unto the disciples,
    The days will '
  '46': 'come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and
    ye shall not see it.  23 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go
    not after them, nor follow them. 24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out
    of the one part under '
  '47': 'heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of
    man be in his day.  25 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of
    this generation. 26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
    days of the Son of '
  '48': 'man.  27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
    marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and
    destroyed them all. 28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat,
    they drank, they '
  '49': 'bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;  29 But the same day that
    Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed
    them all. 30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
    31 In that day, he which '
  '50': 'shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come
    down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return
    back.  32 Remember Lot''s wife.'

    into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 11 The
    Pharisee stood '

    justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be
    abased; and he '
  '10': 'that humbleth himself shall be exalted.  15 And they brought unto him also
    infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked
    them. 16 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come
    unto me, and forbid '

    adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father
    and thy mother. 21 '
  '13': 'And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.  22 Now when Jesus heard
    these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou
    hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and
    come, follow me. '
  '14': '23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.  24
    And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they
    that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 25 For it is easier for a camel
    to go through a '
  '15': 'needle''s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  26
    And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? 27 And he said, The things
    which are impossible with men are possible with God. 28 Then Peter said, Lo, we
    have left all, and '
  '16': 'followed thee.  29 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is
    no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for
    the kingdom of God''s sake, 30 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present
    time, and in the '
  '17': 'world to come life everlasting.  31 Then he took unto him the twelve, and
    said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written
    by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. 32 For he shall
    be delivered unto the '
  '18': 'Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:  33
    And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise
    again. 34 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from
    them, neither '
  '19': 'knew they the things which were spoken.  35 And it came to pass, that as
    he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
    36 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. 37 And they told
    him, that Jesus of '
  '20': 'Nazareth passeth by.  38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David,
    have mercy on me. 39 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold
    his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
    40 And Jesus stood, '
  '21': 'and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked
    him,  41 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord,
    that I may receive my sight. 42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy
    faith hath saved '
  '22': 'thee.  43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying
    God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.'
  '23': "\nChapter 19\n And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. 2 And, behold,\
    \ there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and\
    \ he was rich. 3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the\
    \ press, because he was "
  '24': 'little of stature.  4 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree
    to see him: for he was to pass that way. 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he
    looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down;
    for to day I must '
  '25': 'abide at thy house.  6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him
    joyfully. 7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone
    to be guest with a man that is a sinner. 8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto
    the Lord: Behold, Lord, '
  '26': 'the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from
    any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.  9 And Jesus said unto him,
    This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
    10 For the Son '
  '27': 'of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.  11 And as they heard
    these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem,
    and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. 12
    He said therefore, A '
  '28': 'certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom,
    and to return.  13 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,
    and said unto them, Occupy till I come. 14 But his citizens hated him, and sent
    a message after '
  '29': 'him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.  15 And it came
    to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded
    these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he
    might know how much '
  '30': 'every man had gained by trading.  16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy
    pound hath gained ten pounds. 17 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant:
    because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten
    cities. 18 And the '
  '31': 'second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.  19 And he
    said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. 20 And another came, saying,
    Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: 21 For
    I feared thee, '
  '32': 'because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down,
    and reapest that thou didst not sow.  22 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own
    mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere
    man, taking up '
  '33': 'that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:  23 Wherefore then
    gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required
    mine own with usury? 24 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the
    pound, and give it to '
  '34': 'him that hath ten pounds.  25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten
    pounds.) 26 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given;
    and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. 27
    But those mine enemies, '
  '35': 'which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them
    before me.  28 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.
    29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the
    mount called '
  '36': 'the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,  30 Saying, Go ye into
    the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt
    tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither. 31 And if any
    man ask you, Why do '
  '37': 'ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.  32
    And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.
    33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose
    ye the '
  '38': 'colt?  34 And they said, The Lord hath need of him. 35 And they brought him
    to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.
    36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. 37 And when he was come
    nigh, even now '
  '39': 'at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples
    began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that
    they had seen;  38 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the
    Lord: peace in '
  '40': 'heaven, and glory in the highest.  39 And some of the Pharisees from among
    the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. 40 And he answered
    and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones
    would immediately '
  '41': 'cry out.  41 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over
    it, 42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things
    which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. 43 For the
    days shall come '
  '42': 'upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass
    thee round, and keep thee in on every side,  44 And shall lay thee even with the
    ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone
    upon another; '
  '43': 'because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.  45 And he went into
    the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;
    46 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have
    made it a den of '
  '44': 'thieves.  47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and
    the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, 48 And could not
    find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.'
  '45': "\nChapter 20\n And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught\
    \ the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the\
    \ scribes came upon him with the elders, 2 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us,\
    \ by what authority doest "
  '46': 'thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?  3 And he
    answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: 4 The
    baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? 5 And they reasoned with themselves,
    saying, If we '
  '47': 'shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?  6 But
    and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that
    John was a prophet. 7 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.
    8 And Jesus said '
  '48': 'unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.  9 Then
    began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard,
    and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time. 10
    And at the season he '
  '49': 'sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit
    of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.  11 And
    again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully,
    and sent him away '
  '50': 'empty.  12 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast
    him out. 13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my
    beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.'

  '1': ' 14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying,
    This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. 15
    So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the
    lord of the vineyard '
  '2': 'do unto them?  16 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give
    the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid. 17 And
    he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the
    builders rejected, '
  '3': 'the same is become the head of the corner?  18 Whosoever shall fall upon that
    stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
    19 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on
    him; and they '
  '4': 'feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against
    them.  20 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves
    just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him
    unto the '
  '5': 'power and authority of the governor.  21 And they asked him, saying, Master,
    we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person
    of any, but teachest the way of God truly: 22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute
    unto Caesar, or '
  '6': 'no?  23 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye
    me? 24 Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered
    and said, Caesar''s. 25 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the
    things which be '
  '7': 'Caesar''s, and unto God the things which be God''s.  26 And they could not
    take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and
    held their peace. 27 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that
    there is any '
  '8': 'resurrection; and they asked him,  28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us,
    If any man''s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his
    brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 29 There were
    therefore seven '
  '9': 'brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.  30 And the
    second took her to wife, and he died childless. 31 And the third took her; and
    in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died. 32 Last of
    all the woman died '
  '10': 'also.  33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven
    had her to wife. 34 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world
    marry, and are given in marriage: 35 But they which shall be accounted worthy
    to obtain that '
  '11': 'world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in
    marriage:  36 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels;
    and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. 37 Now that
    the dead are '
  '12': 'raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of
    Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.  38 For he is not a God of
    the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. 39 Then certain of the scribes
    answering said, '
  '13': 'Master, thou hast well said.  40 And after that they durst not ask him any
    question at all. 41 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David''s
    son? 42 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord,
    Sit thou on my '
  '14': 'right hand,  43 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool. 44 David therefore
    calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? 45 Then in the audience of all the people
    he said unto his disciples, 46 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in
    long robes, and '
  '15': 'love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and
    the chief rooms at feasts;  47 Which devour widows'' houses, and for a shew make
    long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.'
  '16': "\nChapter 21\n And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts\
    \ into the treasury. 2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither\
    \ two mites. 3 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath\
    \ cast in more than they all: "
  '17': '4 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God:
    but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.  5 And as some
    spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
    6 As for these things '
  '18': 'which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left
    one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.  7 And they asked him,
    saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when
    these things shall '
  '19': 'come to pass?  8 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many
    shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not
    therefore after them. 9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not
    terrified: for these '
  '20': 'things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.  10 Then said

    and fearful sights '
  '21': 'and great signs shall there be from heaven.  12 But before all these, they
    shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues,
    and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name''s sake. 13
    And it shall '
  '22': 'turn to you for a testimony.  14 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not
    to meditate before what ye shall answer: 15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom,

    shall be betrayed '
  '23': 'both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you

    patience possess ye '
  '24': 'your souls.  20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then
    know that the desolation thereof is nigh. 21 Then let them which are in Judaea
    flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and
    let not them that '

    are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be
    great distress in the '
  '26': 'land, and wrath upon this people.  24 And they shall fall by the edge of
    the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall
    be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
    25 And there shall be '
  '27': 'signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress
    of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;  26 Men''s hearts
    failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on
    the earth: for the '
  '28': 'powers of heaven shall be shaken.  27 And then shall they see the Son of
    man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 28 And when these things begin
    to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth
    nigh. 29 And he '

    he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives. 38 And
    all the people came '

    \ him; for they feared the people. 3 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot,\
    \ being of the number "
  '35': 'of the twelve.  4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests
    and captains, how he might betray him unto them. 5 And they were glad, and covenanted
    to give him money. 6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto
    them in the '
  '36': 'absence of the multitude.  7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when
    the passover must be killed. 8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare
    us the passover, that we may eat. 9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that
    we prepare? 10 And '
  '37': 'he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall
    a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he
    entereth in.  11 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith
    unto thee, Where is '
  '38': 'the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?  12 And
    he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. 13 And they
    went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. 14
    And when the hour was '
  '39': 'come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.  15 And he said unto
    them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
    16 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled
    in the kingdom of God. '
  '40': '17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide
    it among yourselves:  18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of
    the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. 19 And he took bread, and gave
    thanks, and brake it, and '
  '41': 'gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in
    remembrance of me.  20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is
    the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. 21 But, behold, the hand
    of him that betrayeth '
  '42': 'me is with me on the table.  22 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was
    determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! 23 And they began to
    enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. 24 And
    there was also a '
  '43': 'strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.  25 And
    he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and
    they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. 26 But ye shall
    not be so: but he that '
  '44': 'is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as
    he that doth serve.  27 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he
    that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.
    28 Ye are they '
  '45': 'which have continued with me in my temptations.  29 And I appoint unto you
    a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; 30 That ye may eat and drink at
    my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
    31 And the Lord '
  '46': 'said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift
    you as wheat:  32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when
    thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. 33 And he said unto him, Lord, I
    am ready to go with '
  '47': 'thee, both into prison, and to death.  34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter,
    the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou
    knowest me. 35 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip,
    and shoes, lacked ye '
  '48': 'any thing? And they said, Nothing.  36 Then said he unto them, But now, he
    that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no
    sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. 37 For I say unto you, that this
    that is written must '

    the things concerning me have an end.  38 And they said, Lord, behold, here are
    two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. 39 And he came out, and went,
    as he was wont, to '
  '50': the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.  40 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. 41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,

    healed him. 52 '
  '5': 'Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the
    elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords
    and staves?  53 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no
    hands against me: '
  '6': 'but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.  54 Then took they him,
    and led him, and brought him into the high priest''s house. And Peter followed
    afar off. 55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were
    set down together, '
  '7': 'Peter sat down among them.  56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by
    the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
    57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. 58 And after a little while
    another saw him, and '
  '8': 'said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.  59 And about
    the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this
    fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. 60 And Peter said, Man, I know
    not what thou '
  '9': 'sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.  61 And the Lord
    turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how
    he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 62 And
    Peter went out, and '
  '10': 'wept bitterly.  63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.
    64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him,
    saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? 65 And many other things blasphemously
    spake they '
  '11': 'against him.  66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and
    the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council,
    saying, 67 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you,
    ye will not believe: '
  '12': '68 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.  69 Hereafter
    shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. 70 Then said they
    all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. 71
    And they said, '
  '13': 'What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own
    mouth. '
  '14': "\nChapter 23\n And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.\
    \ 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the\
    \ nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is\
    \ Christ a King. 3 And "
  '15': 'Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered
    him and said, Thou sayest it.  4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to
    the people, I find no fault in this man. 5 And they were the more fierce, saying,
    He stirreth up the '
  '16': 'people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.  6
    When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. 7 And
    as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod''s jurisdiction, he sent him to
    Herod, who himself '
  '17': 'also was at Jerusalem at that time.  8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding
    glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many
    things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. 9 Then he questioned
    with '
  '18': 'him in many words; but he answered him nothing.  10 And the chief priests
    and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. 11 And Herod with his men of war
    set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent
    him again to Pilate. '
  '19': '12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before
    they were at enmity between themselves.  13 And Pilate, when he had called together
    the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 14 Said unto them, Ye have brought
    this man '
  '20': 'unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined
    him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof
    ye accuse him:  15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing
    worthy of death is done '
  '21': 'unto him.  16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him. 17 (For of
    necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) 18 And they cried out all
    at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: 19 (Who for
    a certain sedition '
  '22': 'made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)  20 Pilate therefore,
    willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. 21 But they cried, saying, Crucify
    him, crucify him. 22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath
    he done? I have '
  '23': 'found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him
    go.  23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified.
    And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. 24 And Pilate gave
    sentence that it '
  '24': 'should be as they required.  25 And he released unto them him that for sedition
    and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus
    to their will. 26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian,
    coming '
  '25': 'out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it
    after Jesus.  27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
    which also bewailed and lamented him. 28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters
    of Jerusalem, '
  '26': 'weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.  29 For,
    behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren,
    and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. 30 Then shall
    they begin to say '
  '27': 'to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.  31 For if they
    do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? 32 And there were
    also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. 33 And when they
    were come to the '
  '28': 'place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors,
    one on the right hand, and the other on the left.  34 Then said Jesus, Father,
    forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and
    cast lots. 35 And '
  '29': 'the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying,
    He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.  36
    And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, 37
    And saying, If thou '
  '30': 'be the king of the Jews, save thyself.  38 And a superscription also was
    written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, This Is The King
    Of The Jews. 39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying,
    If thou be Christ, '
  '31': 'save thyself and us.  40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost
    not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 41 And we indeed
    justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing
    amiss. 42 And he '
  '32': 'said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.  43
    And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in
    paradise. 44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all
    the earth until the '
  '33': 'ninth hour.  45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was
    rent in the midst. 46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
    into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
    47 Now when the '
  '34': 'centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was
    a righteous man.  48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding
    the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. 49 And all his
    acquaintance, and '
  '35': 'the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these
    things.  50 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was
    a good man, and a just: 51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed
    of them;) he was of '
  '36': 'Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of
    God.  52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. 53 And he took
    it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in
    stone, wherein never '
  '37': 'man before was laid.  54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath
    drew on. 55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after,
    and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. 56 And they returned, and
    prepared spices and '
  '38': 'ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment. '
  '39': "\nChapter 24\n Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,\
    \ they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and\
    \ certain others with them. 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.\
    \ 3 And they "
  '40': 'entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.  4 And it came to pass,
    as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining
    garments: 5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth,
    they said unto '
  '41': 'them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?  6 He is not here, but is risen:
    remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, 7 Saying, The Son of
    man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the
    third day rise '
  '42': 'again.  8 And they remembered his words, 9 And returned from the sepulchre,
    and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. 10 It was Mary
    Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were
    with them, which told '
  '43': 'these things unto the apostles.  11 And their words seemed to them as idle
    tales, and they believed them not. 12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre;
    and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed,
    wondering in '
  '44': 'himself at that which was come to pass.  13 And, behold, two of them went
    that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore
    furlongs. 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
    15 And it came to '
  '45': 'pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew
    near, and went with them.  16 But their eyes were holden that they should not
    know him. 17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that
    ye have one to '
  '46': 'another, as ye walk, and are sad?  18 And the one of them, whose name was
    Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast
    not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? 19 And he said
    unto them, What '
  '47': 'things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a
    prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:  20 And how the
    chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have
    crucified him. 21 But we '
  '48': 'trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside
    all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.  22 Yea, and certain
    women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
    23 And when '
  '49': 'they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision
    of angels, which said that he was alive.  24 And certain of them which were with
    us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him
    they saw not. 25 '
  '50': 'Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the
    prophets have spoken:  26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and
    to enter into his glory?'

  '1': ' 27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in
    all the scriptures the things concerning himself. 28 And they drew nigh unto the
    village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
    29 But they '
  '2': 'constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the
    day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.  30 And it came to pass,
    as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave
    to them. 31 And their '
  '3': 'eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.  32
    And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked
    with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? 33 And they rose
    up the same hour, '
  '4': 'and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them
    that were with them,  34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to
    Simon. 35 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known
    of them in breaking '
  '5': 'of bread.  36 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of
    them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 37 But they were terrified and affrighted,
    and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 38 And he said unto them, Why are ye
    troubled? and '
  '6': 'why do thoughts arise in your hearts?  39 Behold my hands and my feet, that
    it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as
    ye see me have. 40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his
    feet. 41 And while '
  '7': 'they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here
    any meat?  42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
    43 And he took it, and did eat before them. 44 And he said unto them, These are
    the words which I '
  '8': 'spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled,
    which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms,
    concerning me.  45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand
    the scriptures, '
  '9': '46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to
    suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:  47 And that repentance and remission
    of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
    48 And ye '

    Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with
    power from on high. 50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted
    up his hands, and '

    from them, and carried up into heaven. 52 And they worshipped him, and returned

  '1': "Chapter 1\n In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and\
    \ the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were\
    \ made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. 4 In him\
    \ was life; and the life was "
  '2': 'the light of men.  5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
    it not. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 The same came
    for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
    8 He '
  '3': 'was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.  9 That was
    the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. 10 He was
    in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. 11 He
    came unto his own, '
  '4': 'and his own received him not.  12 But as many as received him, to them gave
    he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: 13
    Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
    man, but of God. 14 '
  '5': 'And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory,
    the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  15
    John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that
    cometh after me is '
  '6': 'preferred before me: for he was before me.  16 And of his fulness have all
    we received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given by Moses, but grace
    and truth came by Jesus Christ. 18 No man hath seen God at any time, the only
    begotten Son, which is '
  '7': 'in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.  19 And this is the record
    of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who
    art thou? 20 And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.
    21 And they '
  '8': 'asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that
    prophet? And he answered, No.  22 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that
    we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? 23 He
    said, I am the voice '
  '9': 'of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said
    the prophet Esaias.  24 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. 25 And
    they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that
    Christ, nor Elias, '
  '10': 'neither that prophet?  26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water:
    but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; 27 He it is, who coming after
    me is preferred before me, whose shoe''s latchet I am not worthy to unloose. 28
    These things were '
  '11': 'done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  29 The next day
    John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh
    away the sin of the world. 30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man
    which is preferred '
  '12': 'before me: for he was before me.  31 And I knew him not: but that he should
    be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. 32 And John
    bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and
    it abode upon him. '
  '13': '33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same
    said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on
    him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  34 And I saw, and bare
    record that this is '
  '14': 'the Son of God.  35 Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
    36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! 37 And
    the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 38 Then Jesus turned,
    and saw '
  '15': 'them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi,
    (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  39 He saith
    unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him
    that day: for it '
  '16': 'was about the tenth hour.  40 One of the two which heard John speak, and
    followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter''s brother. 41 He first findeth his own
    brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being
    interpreted, the Christ. 42 '
  '17': 'And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art
    Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation,
    A stone.  43 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
    Philip, and saith unto '
  '18': 'him, Follow me.  44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
    45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses
    in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
    46 And '

    of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! 48 Nathanael saith unto
    him, Whence '
  '20': 'knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called
    thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  49 Nathanael answered and
    saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. 50
    Jesus answered and '
  '21': 'said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest
    thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  51 And he saith unto him, Verily,

  '23': "\nChapter 2\n And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;\
    \ and the mother of Jesus was there: 2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples,\
    \ to the marriage. 3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto\
    \ him, They have no wine. "
  '24': '4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is
    not yet come.  5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
    you, do it. 6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner
    of the purifying of the '
  '25': 'Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.  7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill
    the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 8 And he saith
    unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare
    it. 9 When the ruler '
  '26': 'of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence
    it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast
    called the bridegroom,  10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth
    set forth good wine; '
  '27': 'and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept
    the good wine until now.  11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee,
    and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 12 After this
    he went down '
  '28': 'to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and
    they continued there not many days.  13 And the Jews'' passover was at hand, and
    Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and
    sheep and doves, and '
  '29': 'the changers of money sitting:  15 And when he had made a scourge of small
    cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured
    out the changers'' money, and overthrew the tables; 16 And said unto them that
    sold doves, Take '
  '30': 'these things hence; make not my Father''s house an house of merchandise.  17
    And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath
    eaten me up. 18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou
    unto us, seeing '
  '31': 'that thou doest these things?  19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy
    this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. 20 Then said the Jews, Forty
    and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
    21 But he spake '
  '32': 'of the temple of his body.  22 When therefore he was risen from the dead,
    his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the
    scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem
    at the passover, in the '
  '33': 'feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he
    did.  24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,
    25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.'
  '34': "\nChapter 3\n There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler\
    \ of the Jews: 2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we\
    \ know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles\
    \ that thou doest, except God be "
  '35': 'with him.  3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
    thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 4 Nicodemus
    saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second
    time into his mother''s '
  '36': 'womb, and be born?  5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except
    a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
    God. 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the
    Spirit is spirit. 7 '
  '37': 'Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.  8 The wind bloweth
    where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence
    it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. 9
    Nicodemus answered '
  '38': 'and said unto him, How can these things be?  10 Jesus answered and said unto
    him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? 11 Verily, verily,
    I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and
    ye receive not '
  '39': 'our witness.  12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how
    shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? 13 And no man hath ascended
    up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is
    in heaven. 14 And as '
  '40': 'Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man
    be lifted up:  15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
    eternal life. 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
    that whosoever '
  '41': 'believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God
    sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through
    him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that
    believeth not is '
  '42': 'condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten
    Son of God.  19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
    and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For
    every one '
  '43': 'that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds
    should be reproved.  21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his
    deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. 22 After these things
    came Jesus and his '
  '44': 'disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  23
    And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water
    there: and they came, and were baptized. 24 For John was not yet cast into prison.
    25 '
  '45': 'Then there arose a question between some of John''s disciples and the Jews
    about purifying.  26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that
    was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth,
    and all men '
  '46': 'come to him.  27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except
    it be given him from heaven. 28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I
    am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. 29 He that hath the bride is
    the bridegroom: but the '
  '47': 'friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly
    because of the bridegroom''s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  30 He
    must increase, but I must decrease. 31 He that cometh from above is above all:
    he that is of the '
  '48': 'earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is
    above all.  32 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man
    receiveth his testimony. 33 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his
    seal that God is true.'
  '49': ' 34 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not
    the Spirit by measure unto him. 35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all
    things into his hand. 36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and
    he that believeth '
  '50': 'not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. '
JohnBook2:
  '1': "\nChapter 4\n When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that\
    \ Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 2 (Though Jesus himself baptized\
    \ not, but his disciples,) 3 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.\
    \ 4 And he must needs go "
  '2': 'through Samaria.  5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar,
    near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 6 Now Jacob''s
    well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the
    well: and it '
  '3': 'was about the sixth hour.  7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water:
    Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 8 (For his disciples were gone away unto
    the city to buy meat.) 9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that
    thou, being a '
  '4': 'Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no
    dealings with the Samaritans.  10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest
    the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest
    have asked of '
  '5': 'him, and he would have given thee living water.  11 The woman saith unto him,
    Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast
    thou that living water? 12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave
    us the well, and '
  '6': 'drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?  13 Jesus answered
    and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 14 But
    whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but
    the water that I shall '
  '7': 'give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.  15
    The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither
    come hither to draw. 16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
    17 The '
  '8': 'woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast
    well said, I have no husband:  18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom
    thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. 19 The woman saith
    unto him, Sir, I '
  '9': 'perceive that thou art a prophet.  20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain;
    and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 21 Jesus
    saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this
    mountain, nor '
  '10': 'yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.  22 Ye worship ye know not what: we
    know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour cometh, and
    now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth:
    for the Father '
  '11': 'seeketh such to worship him.  24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him
    must worship him in spirit and in truth. 25 The woman saith unto him, I know that
    Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
    26 Jesus '
  '12': 'saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.  27 And upon this came his
    disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What
    seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? 28 The woman then left her waterpot,
    and went her way into '
  '13': 'the city, and saith to the men,  29 Come, see a man, which told me all things
    that ever I did: is not this the Christ? 30 Then they went out of the city, and
    came unto him. 31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master,
    eat. 32 But he said '
  '14': 'unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.  33 Therefore said the
    disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? 34 Jesus saith
    unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
    35 Say not ye, '
  '15': 'There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you,
    Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.  36
    And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that
    both he that '
  '16': 'soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.  37 And herein is that saying
    true, One soweth, and another reapeth. 38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed
    no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. 39 And many
    of the '
  '17': 'Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which
    testified, He told me all that ever I did.  40 So when the Samaritans were come
    unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there
    two days. 41 And many '
  '18': 'more believed because of his own word;  42 And said unto the woman, Now we
    believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know
    that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. 43 Now after two days
    he departed thence, '
  '19': 'and went into Galilee.  44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath
    no honour in his own country. 45 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans
    received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast:
    for they also '
  '20': 'went unto the feast.  46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where
    he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at
    Capernaum. 47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he
    went unto him, and '
  '21': 'besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the
    point of death.  48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders,
    ye will not believe. 49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child
    die. 50 Jesus saith '
  '22': 'unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that
    Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.  51 And as he was now going down,
    his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. 52 Then enquired he
    of them the hour '
  '23': 'when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh
    hour the fever left him.  53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour,
    in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his
    whole house. 54 This is '
  '24': 'again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into
    Galilee. '
  '25': "\nChapter 5\n After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up\
    \ to Jerusalem. 2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which\
    \ is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. 3 In these lay\
    \ a great multitude of impotent "
  '26': 'folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.  4 For
    an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water:
    whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole
    of whatsoever disease '
  '27': 'he had.  5 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and
    eight years. 6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time
    in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 7 The impotent man answered
    him, Sir, I '
  '28': 'have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while
    I am coming, another steppeth down before me.  8 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take
    up thy bed, and walk. 9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his
    bed, and walked: '
  '29': 'and on the same day was the sabbath.  10 The Jews therefore said unto him
    that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy
    bed. 11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up
    thy bed, and walk. 12 '
  '30': 'Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed,
    and walk?  13 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed
    himself away, a multitude being in that place. 14 Afterward Jesus findeth him
    in the temple, and '
  '31': 'said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing
    come unto thee.  15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which
    had made him whole. 16 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought
    to slay him, because '
  '32': 'he had done these things on the sabbath day.  17 But Jesus answered them,
    My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. 18 Therefore the Jews sought the more
    to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God
    was his Father, making '
  '33': 'himself equal with God.  19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily,
    verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the
    Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.
    20 For the Father '
  '34': 'loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will
    shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.  21 For as the Father raiseth
    up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. 22
    For the Father '
  '35': 'judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:  23 That all
    men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not
    the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. 24 Verily, verily, I say
    unto you, He that '
  '36': 'heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life,
    and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  25
    Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead
    shall hear the voice of '
  '37': 'the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.  26 For as the Father hath
    life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 27 And hath
    given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. 28
    Marvel not at this: '
  '38': 'for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear
    his voice,  29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection
    of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. 30
    I can of mine own '
  '39': 'self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek
    not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.  31 If I bear
    witness of myself, my witness is not true. 32 There is another that beareth witness
    of me; and I '
  '40': 'know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.  33 Ye sent unto
    John, and he bare witness unto the truth. 34 But I receive not testimony from
    man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. 35 He was a burning and a
    shining light: and ye '
  '41': 'were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.  36 But I have greater
    witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish,
    the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. 37
    And the Father '
  '42': 'himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard
    his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.  38 And ye have not his word abiding
    in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. 39 Search the scriptures; for
    in them ye think '
  '43': 'ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.  40 And ye will
    not come to me, that ye might have life. 41 I receive not honour from men. 42
    But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. 43 I am come in my Father''s
    name, and ye '
  '44': 'receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.  44
    How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour
    that cometh from God only? 45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father:
    there is one '
  '45': that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.  46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me. 47 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
  '46': "\nChapter 6\n After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which\
    \ is the sea of Tiberias. 2 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw\
    \ his miracles which he did on them that were diseased. 3 And Jesus went up into\
    \ a mountain, and there he "
  '47': 'sat with his disciples.  4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
    5 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he
    saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? 6 And this he
    said to prove him: '
  '48': 'for he himself knew what he would do.  7 Philip answered him, Two hundred
    pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take
    a little. 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter''s brother, saith unto him,
    9 There is a lad '
  '49': 'here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they
    among so many?  10 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass
    in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 11 And Jesus
    took the loaves; '
  '50': 'and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples
    to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. '

  '1': ' 12 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments
    that remain, that nothing be lost. 13 Therefore they gathered them together, and
    filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained
    over and '
  '2': 'above unto them that had eaten.  14 Then those men, when they had seen the
    miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come
    into the world. 15 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take
    him by force, to make '
  '3': 'him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.  16 And when
    even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, 17 And entered into a
    ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was
    not come to them. 18 '
  '4': 'And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.  19 So when they had
    rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the
    sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid. 20 But he saith unto
    them, It is I; be not '
  '5': 'afraid.  21 Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately
    the ship was at the land whither they went. 22 The day following, when the people
    which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there,
    save that one '
  '6': 'whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples
    into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;  23 (Howbeit there
    came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after
    that the '
  '7': 'Lord had given thanks:)  24 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not
    there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum,
    seeking for Jesus. 25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea,
    they said unto him, '
  '8': 'Rabbi, when camest thou hither?  26 Jesus answered them and said, Verily,
    verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because
    ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. 27 Labour not for the meat which perisheth,
    but for that '
  '9': 'meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give
    unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.  28 Then said they unto him, What
    shall we do, that we might work the works of God? 29 Jesus answered and said unto
    them, This is the '
  '10': 'work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.  30 They said therefore
    unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what
    dost thou work? 31 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written,
    He gave them bread '
  '11': 'from heaven to eat.  32 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
    unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you
    the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from
    heaven, and giveth life '
  '12': 'unto the world.  34 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this
    bread. 35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to
    me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. 36 But
    I said unto you, That ye '
  '13': 'also have seen me, and believe not.  37 All that the Father giveth me shall
    come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. 38 For I came
    down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. 39
    And this is the '
  '14': 'Father''s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should
    lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.  40 And this is the
    will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on
    him, may have '
  '15': 'everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.  41 The Jews then
    murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
    42 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother
    we know? how is it '
  '16': 'then that he saith, I came down from heaven?  43 Jesus therefore answered
    and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. 44 No man can come to me, except
    the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
    45 It is written '
  '17': 'in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore
    that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.  46 Not that
    any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.
    47 Verily, verily, I '
  '18': 'say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.  48 I am that
    bread of life. 49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
    50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof,
    and not die. 51 I am '
  '19': 'the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread,
    he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will
    give for the life of the world.  52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves,
    saying, How can '
  '20': 'this man give us his flesh to eat?  53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily,
    verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his
    blood, ye have no life in you. 54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood,
    hath eternal life; '
  '21': 'and I will raise him up at the last day.  55 For my flesh is meat indeed,
    and my blood is drink indeed. 56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood,
    dwelleth in me, and I in him. 57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live
    by the Father: so he '
  '22': 'that eateth me, even he shall live by me.  58 This is that bread which came
    down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth
    of this bread shall live for ever. 59 These things said he in the synagogue, as
    he taught in '
  '23': 'Capernaum.  60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this,
    said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? 61 When Jesus knew in himself that
    his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you? 62 What
    and if ye shall see '
  '24': 'the Son of man ascend up where he was before?  63 It is the spirit that quickeneth;
    the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit,
    and they are life. 64 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew
    from the '
  '25': 'beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.  65
    And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it
    were given unto him of my Father. 66 From that time many of his disciples went
    back, and walked no '
  '26': more with him.  67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? 68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. 69 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.
  '27': ' 70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is
    a devil? 71 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should
    betray him, being one of the twelve.'
  '28': "\nChapter 7\n After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not\
    \ walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. 2 Now the Jew's feast of\
    \ tabernacles was at hand. 3 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence,\
    \ and go into Judaea, that "
  '29': 'thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.  4 For there is no
    man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly.
    If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. 5 For neither did his brethren
    believe in him. 6 '
  '30': 'Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway
    ready.  7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it,
    that the works thereof are evil. 8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto
    this feast: for my '
  '31': 'time is not yet full come.  9 When he had said these words unto them, he
    abode still in Galilee. 10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also
    up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 11 Then the Jews sought
    him at the feast, '
  '32': 'and said, Where is he?  12 And there was much murmuring among the people
    concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth
    the people. 13 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. 14 Now
    about the midst of '
  '33': 'the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.  15 And the Jews marvelled,
    saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? 16 Jesus answered
    them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 17 If any man will
    do his will, '
  '34': 'he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of
    myself.  18 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh
    his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. 19
    Did not Moses '
  '35': 'give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to
    kill me?  20 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about
    to kill thee? 21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and
    ye all marvel. 22 Moses '
  '36': 'therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of
    the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.  23 If a man on the
    sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken;
    are ye angry at me, '
  '37': 'because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?  24 Judge
    not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. 25 Then said some
    of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? 26 But, lo, he speaketh
    boldly, and '
  '38': 'they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very
    Christ?  27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no
    man knoweth whence he is. 28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying,
    Ye both know me, and '
  '39': 'ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is
    true, whom ye know not.  29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent
    me. 30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his
    hour was not yet come. '
  '40': '31 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh,
    will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?  32 The Pharisees
    heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and
    the chief priests '
  '41': 'sent officers to take him.  33 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while
    am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. 34 Ye shall seek me, and shall
    not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. 35 Then said the Jews among
    themselves, '
  '42': 'Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed
    among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?  36 What manner of saying is this
    that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither
    ye cannot come? 37 '
  '43': 'In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying,
    If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.  38 He that believeth on me,
    as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
    39 (But this '
  '44': 'spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for
    the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)  40
    Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this
    is the Prophet. 41 '
  '45': 'Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of
    Galilee?  42 Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David,
    and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? 43 So there was a division
    among the people '
  '46': 'because of him.  44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid
    hands on him. 45 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and
    they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? 46 The officers answered, Never
    man spake like '
  '47': 'this man.  47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? 48
    Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? 49 But this people
    who knoweth not the law are cursed. 50 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came
    to Jesus by night, '
  '48': 'being one of them,)  51 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and
    know what he doeth? 52 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?
    Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. 53 And every man went
    unto his own house.'
  '49': "\nChapter 8\n Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 2 And early in the morning\
    \ he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat\
    \ down, and taught them. 3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman\
    \ taken in adultery; and "
  '50': 'when they had set her in the midst,  4 They say unto him, Master, this woman

  '1': ' 6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus
    stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them
    not. 7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto
    them, He that is '
  '2': 'without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.  8 And again he
    stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 9 And they which heard it, being convicted
    by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto
    the last: and '
  '3': 'Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.  10 When Jesus
    had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where
    are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 11 She said, No man, Lord.
    And Jesus said '
  '4': 'unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.  12 Then spake Jesus
    again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall
    not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 13 The Pharisees therefore
    said unto '
  '5': 'him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.  14 Jesus answered
    and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for
    I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and
    whither I go. 15 '
  '6': 'Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.  16 And yet if I judge, my judgment
    is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. 17 It is also
    written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. 18 I am one that bear
    witness of '
  '7': 'myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.  19 Then said they
    unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father:
    if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. 20 These words spake
    Jesus in the '
  '8': 'treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his
    hour was not yet come.  21 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye
    shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. 22 Then
    said the Jews, '
  '9': 'Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.  23
    And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world;
    I am not of this world. 24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your
    sins: for if ye '
  '10': 'believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.  25 Then said they unto
    him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you
    from the beginning. 26 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that
    sent me is '
  '11': 'true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.  27
    They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. 28 Then said Jesus unto
    them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he,
    and that I do nothing '
  '12': 'of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.  29 And
    he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always
    those things that please him. 30 As he spake these words, many believed on him.
    31 Then said Jesus to '
  '13': 'those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye
    my disciples indeed;  32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make
    you free. 33 They answered him, We be Abraham''s seed, and were never in bondage
    to any man: how sayest '
  '14': 'thou, Ye shall be made free?  34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say
    unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. 35 And the servant abideth
    not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. 36 If the Son therefore shall
    make you '
  '15': 'free, ye shall be free indeed.  37 I know that ye are Abraham''s seed; but
    ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. 38 I speak that which
    I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
    39 They answered and '
  '16': 'said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham''s
    children, ye would do the works of Abraham.  40 But now ye seek to kill me, a
    man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.
    41 Ye do the '
  '17': 'deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication;
    we have one Father, even God.  42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father,
    ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself,
    but he sent '
  '18': 'me.  43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my
    word. 44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will
    do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because
    there is no truth in '
  '19': 'him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and
    the father of it.  45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. 46
    Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe
    me? 47 He that is of '
  '20': 'God heareth God''s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not
    of God.  48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou
    art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? 49 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but
    I honour my Father, and '
  '21': 'ye do dishonour me.  50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that
    seeketh and judgeth. 51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying,
    he shall never see death. 52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou
    hast a devil. Abraham '
  '22': 'is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall
    never taste of death.  53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead?
    and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? 54 Jesus answered, If I honour
    myself, my '
  '23': 'honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that
    he is your God:  55 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should
    say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep
    his saying. 56 Your '
  '24': 'father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.  57 Then
    said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
    58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I
    am. 59 Then '
  '25': 'took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of
    the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. '
  '26': "\nChapter 9\n And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his\
    \ birth. 2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man,\
    \ or his parents, that he was born blind? 3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this\
    \ man sinned, nor his parents: "
  '27': 'but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.  4 I must work
    the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man
    can work. 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 6 When
    he had thus spoken, he '
  '28': 'spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes
    of the blind man with the clay,  7 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of
    Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed,
    and came seeing. 8 '
  '29': 'The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was
    blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?  9 Some said, This is he: others
    said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. 10 Therefore said they unto him, How
    were thine eyes '
  '30': 'opened?  11 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and
    anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and
    I went and washed, and I received sight. 12 Then said they unto him, Where is
    he? He said, I know not.'
  '31': ' 13 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. 14 And it
    was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 15 Then again
    the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them,
    He put clay upon mine '
  '32': 'eyes, and I washed, and do see.  16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees,
    This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How
    can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
    17 They say unto '
  '33': 'the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes?
    He said, He is a prophet.  18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that
    he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him
    that had received '
  '34': 'his sight.  19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say
    was born blind? how then doth he now see? 20 His parents answered them and said,
    We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 21 But by what means
    he now seeth, we know '
  '35': 'not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he
    shall speak for himself.  22 These words spake his parents, because they feared
    the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he
    was Christ, he should '
  '36': 'be put out of the synagogue.  23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age;
    ask him. 24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him,
    Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. 25 He answered and said,
    Whether he be a '
  '37': 'sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now
    I see.  26 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine
    eyes? 27 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore
    would ye hear it '
  '38': 'again? will ye also be his disciples?  28 Then they reviled him, and said,
    Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses'' disciples. 29 We know that God spake
    unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. 30 The man answered
    and said unto them, '
  '39': 'Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and
    yet he hath opened mine eyes.  31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but
    if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. 32 Since
    the world began was '
  '40': 'it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.  33
    If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. 34 They answered and said unto
    him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast
    him out. 35 Jesus '
  '41': 'heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto
    him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?  36 He answered and said, Who is he,
    Lord, that I might believe on him? 37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both
    seen him, and it is he '
  '42': 'that talketh with thee.  38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped
    him. 39 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which
    see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. 40 And some of
    the Pharisees which '
  '43': 'were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?  41
    Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say,
    We see; therefore your sin remaineth.'
  '44': "\nChapter 10\n Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the\
    \ door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief\
    \ and a robber. 2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.\
    \ 3 To him the porter "
  '45': 'openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name,

    them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. 5 And a stranger will
    they not follow, '
  '46': 'but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.  6 This
    parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which
    he spake unto them. 7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto
    you, I am the '
  '47': 'door of the sheep.  8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers:
    but the sheep did not hear them. 9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he
    shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. 10 The thief cometh
    not, but for to '
  '48': 'steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life,
    and that they might have it more abundantly.  11 I am the good shepherd: the good
    shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. 12 But he that is an hireling, and not
    the shepherd, whose '
  '49': 'own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and
    fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.  13 The hireling
    fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. 14 I am the good
    shepherd, and know my '

    20 And many of '

    winter. 23 And Jesus '

    \ 3 Therefore his "

    When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory
    of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. 5 Now Jesus loved Martha,
    and her '
  '14': 'sister, and Lazarus.  6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he
    abode two days still in the same place where he was. 7 Then after that saith he
    to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. 8 His disciples say unto him, Master,
    the Jews of late '
  '15': 'sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?  9 Jesus answered, Are
    there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not,
    because he seeth the light of this world. 10 But if a man walk in the night, he
    stumbleth, because '
  '16': 'there is no light in him.  11 These things said he: and after that he saith

    sleep. 12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. 13 Howbeit
    Jesus spake of his '

    fifteen furlongs '

    their brother. 20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went
    and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. 21 Then said Martha unto Jesus,
    Lord, if thou '
  '20': 'hadst been here, my brother had not died.  22 But I know, that even now,
    whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. 23 Jesus saith unto her,
    Thy brother shall rise again. 24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise
    again in the '
  '21': 'resurrection at the last day.  25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection,
    and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
    26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
    27 She saith '
  '22': 'unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God,
    which should come into the world.  28 And when she had so said, she went her way,
    and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for
    thee. 29 As soon as '
  '23': 'she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.  30 Now Jesus was not
    yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 31 The Jews
    then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary,
    that she rose up '
  '24': 'hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep
    there.  32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down
    at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not
    died. 33 When Jesus '
  '25': 'therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her,
    he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.  34 And said, Where have ye laid him?
    They said unto him, Lord, come and see. 35 Jesus wept. 36 Then said the Jews,
    Behold how he loved '
  '26': 'him!  37 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes
    of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? 38 Jesus therefore
    again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay
    upon it. 39 Jesus '
  '27': 'said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith
    unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.  40
    Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou
    shouldest see the '
  '28': 'glory of God?  41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the
    dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that
    thou hast heard me. 42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of
    the people which stand '
  '29': 'by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.  43 And when
    he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. 44 And he
    that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face
    was bound about with a '
  '30': 'napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.  45 Then many of
    the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed
    on him. 46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what
    things Jesus had '
  '31': 'done.  47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and
    said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. 48 If we let him thus alone,
    all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our
    place and nation. 49 '
  '32': 'And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said
    unto them, Ye know nothing at all,  50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us,
    that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
    51 And this spake he '
  '33': 'not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus
    should die for that nation;  52 And not for that nation only, but that also he
    should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
    53 Then from that day '
  '34': 'forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.  54 Jesus therefore
    walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the
    wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
    55 And the Jews'' '
  '35': 'passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem
    before the passover, to purify themselves.  56 Then sought they for Jesus, and
    spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will
    not come to the '
  '36': feast?  57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.
  '37': "\nChapter 12\n Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where\
    \ Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 2 There they\
    \ made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at\
    \ the table with him. 3 "
  '38': 'Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed
    the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled
    with the odour of the ointment.  4 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot,
    Simon''s son, which '
  '39': 'should betray him,  5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence,
    and given to the poor? 6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because
    he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. 7 Then said Jesus,
    Let her '
  '40': 'alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.  8 For the poor
    always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. 9 Much people of the Jews
    therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus'' sake only, but
    that they might see '
  '41': 'Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.  10 But the chief priests
    consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; 11 Because that by reason
    of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. 12 On the next day much
    people that were '
  '42': 'come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,  13
    Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed
    is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. 14 And Jesus, when
    he had found a '
  '43': 'young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,  15 Fear not, daughter of Sion:
    behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass''s colt. 16 These things understood
    not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered
    they that these things '
  '44': 'were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.  17 The
    people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and
    raised him from the dead, bare record. 18 For this cause the people also met him,
    for that they '
  '45': 'heard that he had done this miracle.  19 The Pharisees therefore said among
    themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after
    him. 20 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the
    feast: 21 The same '
  '46': 'came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired
    him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.  22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and
    again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. 23 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour
    is come, that the Son '
  '47': 'of man should be glorified.  24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a
    corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it
    bringeth forth much fruit. 25 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that
    hateth his life in '
  '48': 'this world shall keep it unto life eternal.  26 If any man serve me, let
    him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve
    me, him will my Father honour. 27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?
    Father, save me from '
  '49': 'this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.  28 Father, glorify
    thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it,
    and will glorify it again. 29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it,
    said that it '
  '50': 'thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.  30 Jesus answered and said,
    This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. 31 Now is the judgment
    of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.'

  '1': ' 32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. 33
    This he said, signifying what death he should die. 34 The people answered him,
    We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou,
    The Son of man must '
  '2': 'be lifted up? who is this Son of man?  35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a
    little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness
    come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. 36
    While ye have light, '
  '3': 'believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake
    Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.  37 But though he had done
    so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: 38 That the saying
    of Esaias the '
  '4': 'prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report?
    and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  39 Therefore they could not
    believe, because that Esaias said again, 40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened
    their '
  '5': 'heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their
    heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.  41 These things said Esaias,
    when he saw his glory, and spake of him. 42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers
    also many believed on '
  '6': 'him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should
    be put out of the synagogue:  43 For they loved the praise of men more than the
    praise of God. 44 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not
    on me, but on him '
  '7': 'that sent me.  45 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. 46 I am come
    a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
    47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came
    not to judge the '
  '8': 'world, but to save the world.  48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not
    my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall
    judge him in the last day. 49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father
    which sent me, he gave '
  '9': 'me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.  50 And I know
    that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as
    the Father said unto me, so I speak.'
  '10': "\nChapter 13\n Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that\
    \ his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having\
    \ loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 2 And supper\
    \ being ended, the "
  '11': 'devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon''s son, to betray
    him;  3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and
    that he was come from God, and went to God; 4 He riseth from supper, and laid
    aside his garments; '
  '12': 'and took a towel, and girded himself.  5 After that he poureth water into
    a bason, and began to wash the disciples'' feet, and to wipe them with the towel
    wherewith he was girded. 6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto
    him, Lord, dost thou '
  '13': 'wash my feet?  7 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest
    not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never
    wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
    9 Simon Peter saith '
  '14': 'unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.  10 Jesus
    saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean
    every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. 11 For he knew who should betray him;
    therefore said he, '
  '15': 'Ye are not all clean.  12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken
    his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done
    to you? 13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. 14 If I then,
    your Lord and '
  '16': 'Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another''s feet.  15
    For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. 16 Verily,
    verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that
    is sent '
  '17': 'greater than he that sent him.  17 If ye know these things, happy are ye
    if ye do them. 18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that
    the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his
    heel against me. 19 Now '
  '18': 'I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe
    that I am he.  20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever
    I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 21 When
    Jesus had thus said, '
  '19': 'he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say
    unto you, that one of you shall betray me.  22 Then the disciples looked one on
    another, doubting of whom he spake. 23 Now there was leaning on Jesus'' bosom
    one of his disciples, '
  '20': 'whom Jesus loved.  24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should
    ask who it should be of whom he spake. 25 He then lying on Jesus'' breast saith
    unto him, Lord, who is it? 26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a
    sop, when I have '
  '21': 'dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot,
    the son of Simon.  27 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus
    unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. 28 Now no man at the table knew for what
    intent he spake this '
  '22': 'unto him.  29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus
    had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or,
    that he should give something to the poor. 30 He then having received the sop
    went immediately '
  '23': 'out: and it was night.  31 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now
    is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 32 If God be glorified
    in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
    33 Little '
  '24': 'children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said
    unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.  34 A new commandment
    I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love
    one '
  '25': 'another.  35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have
    love one to another. 36 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
    answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow
    me afterwards. '
  '26': 37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.  38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
  '27': "\nChapter 14\n Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe\

    \ place for you, I will come "
  '28': 'again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.  4
    And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. 5 Thomas saith unto him, Lord,
    we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? 6 Jesus saith unto
    him, I am the way, '
  '29': 'the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  7 If
    ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know
    him, and have seen him. 8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and
    it sufficeth us. 9 '
  '30': 'Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou
    not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest
    thou then, Show us the Father?  10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father,
    and the Father in me? '
  '31': 'the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that
    dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.  11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and
    the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works'' sake. 12 Verily, verily,
    I say unto you, He '
  '32': 'that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works
    than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.  13 And whatsoever ye shall
    ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14
    If ye shall ask '
  '33': 'any thing in my name, I will do it.  15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.
    16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he
    may abide with you for ever; 17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot
    receive, because '
  '34': 'it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with
    you, and shall be in you.  18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to
    you. 19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because
    I live, ye shall '
  '35': 'live also.  20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in
    me, and I in you. 21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is
    that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will
    love him, and will '
  '36': 'manifest myself to him.  22 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how
    is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 23 Jesus
    answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father
    will love him, and '
  '37': 'we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.  24 He that loveth me
    not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father''s
    which sent me. 25 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with
    you. 26 But the '
  '38': 'Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name,
    he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever
    I have said unto you.  27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not
    as the world '
  '39': 'giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be
    afraid.  28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto

    and he will shew you things to come.  14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive
    of mine, and shall shew it unto you. 15 All things that the Father hath are mine:
    therefore '
  '11': 'said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.  16 A little
    while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me,
    because I go to the Father. 17 Then said some of his disciples among themselves,
    What is this that '
  '12': 'he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
    while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?  18 They said therefore,
    What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. 19 Now
    Jesus '
  '13': 'knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire
    among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and
    again, a little while, and ye shall see me?  20 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
    That ye shall weep and '
  '14': 'lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your
    sorrow shall be turned into joy.  21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow,
    because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth
    no more the '
  '15': 'anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.  22 And ye now therefore
    have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your
    joy no man taketh from you. 23 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily,
    verily, I say unto '
  '16': 'you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.  24
    Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your
    joy may be full. 25 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
    cometh, when I '
  '17': 'shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of
    the Father.  26 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that
    I will pray the Father for you: 27 For the Father himself loveth you, because
    ye have loved me, and '
  '18': 'have believed that I came out from God.  28 I came forth from the Father,
    and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. 29
    His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.
    30 Now are we '
  '19': 'sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask
    thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.  31 Jesus answered them,
    Do ye now believe? 32 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall
    be scattered, '
  '20': 'every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because
    the Father is with me.  33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye
    might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer;
    I have overcome '
  '21': 'the world. '
  '22': "\nChapter 17\n These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven,\
    \ and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify\
    \ thee: 2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal\
    \ life to as many as "
  '23': 'thou hast given him.  3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee
    the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. 4 I have glorified thee
    on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. 5 And now,
    O Father, glorify '
  '24': 'thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the
    world was.  6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out
    of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy
    word. 7 Now they have '
  '25': 'known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.  8 For I
    have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them,
    and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou
    didst send me. 9 '
  '26': 'I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given
    me; for they are thine.  10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I
    am glorified in them. 11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the
    world, and I come '
  '27': 'to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given
    me, that they may be one, as we are.  12 While I was with them in the world, I
    kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them
    is lost, but the son '
  '28': 'of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.  13 And now come I to
    thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled
    in themselves. 14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because
    they are not '
  '29': 'of the world, even as I am not of the world.  15 I pray not that thou shouldest
    take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. 16
    They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 17 Sanctify them through
    thy truth: '
  '30': 'thy word is truth.  18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have
    I also sent them into the world. 19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that
    they also might be sanctified through the truth. 20 Neither pray I for these alone,
    but for them also '
  '31': 'which shall believe on me through their word;  21 That they all may be one;
    as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that
    the world may believe that thou hast sent me. 22 And the glory which thou gavest
    me I have given '
  '32': 'them; that they may be one, even as we are one:  23 I in them, and thou in
    me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou
    hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. 24 Father, I will that
    they also, whom '
  '33': 'thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory,
    which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.  25
    O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and
    these have known '
  '34': 'that thou hast sent me.  26 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will
    declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in
    them.'
  '35': "\nChapter 18\n When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his\
    \ disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered,\
    \ and his disciples. 2 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for\
    \ Jesus ofttimes resorted "
  '36': 'thither with his disciples.  3 Judas then, having received a band of men
    and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns
    and torches and weapons. 4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come
    upon him, went forth, '
  '37': 'and said unto them, Whom seek ye?  5 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.
    Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with
    them. 6 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and
    fell to the ground. 7 '
  '38': 'Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.  8
    Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these
    go their way: 9 That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which
    thou gavest me '
  '39': 'have I lost none.  10 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote
    the high priest''s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant''s name was
    Malchus. 11 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the
    cup which my Father hath '
  '40': 'given me, shall I not drink it?  12 Then the band and the captain and officers
    of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, 13 And led him away to Annas first; for
    he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year. 14
    Now Caiaphas was '
  '41': 'he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should
    die for the people.  15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple:
    that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the
    palace of the '
  '42': 'high priest.  16 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that
    other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that
    kept the door, and brought in Peter. 17 Then saith the damsel that kept the door
    unto Peter, Art not '
  '43': 'thou also one of this man''s disciples? He saith, I am not.  18 And the servants
    and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they
    warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself. 19 The high
    priest then '
  '44': 'asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.  20 Jesus answered him,
    I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple,
    whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. 21 Why askest
    thou me? ask them '
  '45': 'which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.  22
    And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with
    the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 23 Jesus answered
    him, If I '
  '46': 'have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou
    me?  24 Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. 25 And Simon
    Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also
    one of his '
  '47': 'disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.  26 One of the servants of the
    high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee
    in the garden with him? 27 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
    28 Then led '
  '48': 'they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and
    they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled;
    but that they might eat the passover.  29 Pilate then went out unto them, and
    said, What accusation '
  '49': 'bring ye against this man?  30 They answered and said unto him, If he were
    not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. 31 Then said Pilate
    unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore
    said unto him, '
  '50': 'It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:  32 That the saying of Jesus
    might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.'

  '1': ' 33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and
    said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 34 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou
    this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? 35 Pilate answered, Am
    I a Jew? Thine own '
  '2': 'nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?  36
    Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world,
    then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but
    now is my '
  '3': 'kingdom not from hence.  37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king
    then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and
    for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.
    Every one that is '
  '4': 'of the truth heareth my voice.  38 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And
    when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I
    find in him no fault at all. 39 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto
    you one at the '
  '5': 'passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?  40
    Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was
    a robber.'
  '6': "\nChapter 19\n Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. 2 And the\
    \ soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on\
    \ him a purple robe, 3 And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with\
    \ their hands. 4 Pilate "
  '7': 'therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth
    to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.  5 Then came Jesus forth,
    wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them,
    Behold the man! 6 When '
  '8': 'the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying,
    Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him:
    for I find no fault in him.  7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our
    law he ought to die, '
  '9': 'because he made himself the Son of God.  8 When Pilate therefore heard that
    saying, he was the more afraid; 9 And went again into the judgment hall, and saith
    unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. 10 Then saith Pilate
    unto him, '
  '10': 'Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify
    thee, and have power to release thee?  11 Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no
    power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that
    delivered me unto '
  '11': 'thee hath the greater sin.  12 And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release
    him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar''s
    friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. 13 When Pilate
    therefore '
  '12': 'heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat
    in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.  14 And it
    was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto
    the Jews, Behold '
  '13': 'your King!  15 But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify
    him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered,
    We have no king but Caesar. 16 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be
    crucified. And they '
  '14': 'took Jesus, and led him away.  17 And he bearing his cross went forth into
    a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: 18
    Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus
    in the midst. 19 And '
  '15': 'Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was Jesus
    Of Nazareth The King Of The Jews.  20 This title then read many of the Jews: for
    the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in
    Hebrew, and Greek, '
  '16': 'and Latin.  21 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,
    The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 22 Pilate answered,
    What I have written I have written. 23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified
    Jesus, took '
  '17': 'his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his
    coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.  24 They said
    therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it
    shall be: that the '
  '18': 'scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them,
    and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.  25
    Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother''s sister, Mary
    the wife of '
  '19': 'Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.  26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and
    the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold
    thy son! 27 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour
    that disciple took '
  '20': 'her unto his own home.  28 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were
    now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. 29 Now
    there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar,
    and put it upon '
  '21': 'hyssop, and put it to his mouth.  30 When Jesus therefore had received the
    vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
    31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should
    not remain upon the '
  '22': 'cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought
    Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.  32
    Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which
    was crucified with '
  '23': 'him.  33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they
    brake not his legs: 34 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side,
    and forthwith came there out blood and water. 35 And he that saw it bare record,
    and his record is '
  '24': 'true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.  36 For these
    things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall
    not be broken. 37 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom
    they pierced. 38 '
  '25': 'And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly
    for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus:
    and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.  39
    And there came also '
  '26': 'Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture
    of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.  40 Then took they the body
    of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the
    Jews is to bury. 41 '
  '27': Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.  42 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
  '28': "\nChapter 20\n The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when\
    \ it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the\
    \ sepulchre. 2 Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple,\
    \ whom Jesus loved, "
  '29': 'and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre,
    and we know not where they have laid him.  3 Peter therefore went forth, and that
    other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. 4 So they ran both together: and the
    other disciple did '
  '30': 'outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.  5 And he stooping down, and
    looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. 6 Then cometh Simon
    Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes
    lie, 7 And the '
  '31': 'napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped
    together in a place by itself.  8 Then went in also that other disciple, which
    came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. 9 For as yet they knew
    not the scripture, '
  '32': 'that he must rise again from the dead.  10 Then the disciples went away again
    unto their own home. 11 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as
    she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, 12 And seeth two angels
    in white '
  '33': 'sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of
    Jesus had lain.  13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith
    unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have
    laid him. 14 And when '
  '34': 'she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew
    not that it was Jesus.  15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom
    seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou
    have borne him '
  '35': 'hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.  16 Jesus
    saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is
    to say, Master. 17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended
    to my Father: but '
  '36': 'go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father;
    and to my God, and your God.  18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that
    she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her. 19 Then the
    same day at '
  '37': 'evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where
    the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the
    midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.  20 And when he had so said, he
    shewed unto them his '
  '38': 'hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.  21
    Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even
    so send I you. 22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto
    them, Receive '
  '39': 'ye the Holy Ghost:  23 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto
    them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. 24 But Thomas, one of
    the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 The other disciples
    therefore said '
  '40': 'unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see
    in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails,
    and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.  26 And after eight days
    again his '
  '41': 'disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being
    shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.  27 Then saith he to
    Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand,
    and thrust it '
  '42': 'into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.  28 And Thomas answered
    and said unto him, My Lord and my God. 29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because
    thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and
    yet have believed. '
  '43': '30 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples,
    which are not written in this book:  31 But these are written, that ye might believe
    that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life
    through his name.'
  '44': "\nChapter 21\n After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples\
    \ at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself. 2 There were together\
    \ Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and\
    \ the sons of "
  '45': 'Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.  3 Simon Peter saith unto them,
    I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and
    entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. 4 But when
    the morning was now '
  '46': 'come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.  5
    Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.
    6 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall
    find. They '
  '47': 'cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of
    fishes.  7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the
    Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher''s coat
    unto him, (for he '
  '48': 'was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.  8 And the other disciples
    came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred
    cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. 9 As soon then as they were come to land,
    they saw a fire '
  '49': 'of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.  10 Jesus saith unto them,
    Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. 11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the
    net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all
    there were so many, '
  '50': yet was not the net broken.  12 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. 13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.

    Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto
    him, Feed my '
  '4': 'sheep.  18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest
    thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou
    shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither
    thou wouldest '
  '5': 'not.  19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And
    when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. 20 Then Peter, turning
    about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his
    breast at supper, and '
  '6': 'said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?  21 Peter seeing him saith to
    Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? 22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that
    he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. 23 Then went this
    saying abroad among '
  '7': 'the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him,
    He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?  24
    This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things:
    and we know '
  '8': that his testimony is true.  25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
