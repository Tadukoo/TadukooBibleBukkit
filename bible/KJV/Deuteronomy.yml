ch8v8: A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;

ch9v13: 'Furthermore the Lord spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:'
ch9v14: 'Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.'

ch9v24: Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.
ch9v25: Thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the Lord had said he would destroy you.
ch9v26: I prayed therefore unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
ch9v27: 'Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:'
ch9v28: Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
ch9v29: Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.
